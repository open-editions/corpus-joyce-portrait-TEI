            <p> The wide playgrounds were swarming with boys. All were <lb n="10042"/>
             shouting and the prefects urged them on with strong cries. The <lb n="10043"/>
             evening air was pale and chilly and after every charge and thud <lb n="10044"/>
             of the footballers the greasy leather orb flew like a heavy bird <lb n="10045"/>
             through the grey light. He kept on the fringe of his line, out of <lb n="10046"/>
             sight of his prefect, out of the reach of the rude feet, feigning to <lb n="10047"/>
             run now and then. He felt his body small and weak amid the <lb n="10048"/>
             throng of players and his eyes were weak and watery. <persName> Rody <lb n="10049"/>
             Kickham</persName> was not like that: he would be captain of the third <lb n="10050"/>
             line all the fellows said.<lb n="10051"/> </p>
            <p> <persName> Rody Kickham</persName> was a decent fellow but <persName> Nasty Roche</persName> was a <lb n="10052"/>
             stink. <persName> Rody Kickham</persName> had greaves in his number and a hamper <lb n="10053"/>
             in the refectory. <persName> Nasty Roche</persName> had big hands. He called the <lb n="10054"/>
             Friday pudding dog-in-the-blanket. And one day he had asked:<lb n="10055"/> </p>
            <p> <said who="Nasty Roche">―What is your name? <lb n="10056"/></said> </p>
            <p> Stephen had answered:<lb n="10057"/> </p>
            <p> <said who="Stephen">― <persName> Stephen Dedalus</persName>. <lb n="10058"/></said> </p>
            <p> Then <persName> Nasty Roche</persName> had said:<lb n="10059"/> </p>
            <p> <said who="Nasty Roche">―What kind of a name is that? <lb n="10060"/></said> </p>
            <p> And when <persName> Stephen</persName> had not been able to answer <persName> Nasty <lb n="10061"/>
             Roche</persName> had asked:<lb n="10062"/> </p>
            <p> <said who="Nasty Roche">―What is your father? <lb n="10063"/></said> </p>
            <p> <persName> Stephen</persName> had answered:<lb n="10064"/> </p>
            <p> <said who="Stephen">―A gentleman. <lb n="10065"/></said> </p>
            <p> Then <persName> Nasty Roche</persName> had asked:<lb n="10066"/> </p>
            <p> <said who="Nasty Roche">―Is he a magistrate? <lb n="10067"/></said> </p>
            <p> He crept about from point to point on the fringe of his line, <lb n="10068"/>
             making little runs now and then. But his hands were bluish <lb n="10069"/>
             with cold. He kept his hands in the sidepockets of his belted <lb n="10070"/>
             grey suit. That was a belt round his jacket. And belt was also to <lb n="10071"/>
             give a fellow a belt. One day a fellow had said to <persName> Cantwell</persName>:<lb n="10072"/> </p>
            <p> <said who="a fellow">―I'd give you such a belt in a second. <lb n="10073"/></said> </p>
            <p> <persName> Cantwell</persName> had answered:<lb n="10074"/> </p>
            <p> <said who="Cantwell">―Go and fight your match. Give <persName> Cecil Thunder</persName> a belt. I'd like <lb n="10075"/>
             to see you. He'd give you a toe in the rump for yourself. <lb n="10076"/></said> </p>
            <p> That was not a nice expression. His mother had told him <lb n="10077"/>
             not to speak with the rough boys in the college. Nice mother! <lb n="10078"/>
             The first day in the hall of the castle when she had said good- <lb n="10079"/>
             bye she had put up her veil double to her nose to kiss him: and <lb n="10080"/>
             her nose and eyes were red. But he had pretended not to see <lb n="10081"/>
             that she was going to cry. She was a nice mother but she was <lb n="10082"/>
             not so nice when she cried. And his father had given him two <lb n="10083"/>
             <seg type="neologism"> fiveshilling </seg> pieces for pocket money. And his father had told <lb n="10084"/>
             him if he wanted anything to write home to him and, whatever <lb n="10085"/>
             he did, never to peach on a fellow. Then at the door of the <lb n="10086"/>
             castle the rector had shaken hands with his father and mother, <lb n="10087"/>
             his soutane fluttering in the breeze, and the car had driven off <lb n="10088"/>
             with his father and mother on it. They had cried to him from <lb n="10089"/>
             the car, waving their hands:<lb n="10090"/> </p>
            <said who="Mary Dedalus, Simon Dedalus">
              <p>―Goodbye, <persName> Stephen</persName>, goodbye!<lb n="10091"/> </p>
              <p>―Goodbye, <persName> Stephen</persName>, goodbye!<lb n="10092"/> </p>
            </said>
            <p> He was caught in the whirl of a scrimmage and, fearful of <lb n="10093"/>
             the flashing eyes and muddy boots, bent down to look through <lb n="10094"/>
             the legs. The fellows were struggling and groaning and their <lb n="10095"/>
             legs were rubbing and kicking and stamping. Then <persName> Jack <lb n="10096"/>
             Lawton</persName>'s yellow boots dodged out the ball and all the other <lb n="10097"/>
             boots and legs ran after. He ran after them a little way and then <lb n="10098"/>
             stopped. It was useless to run on. Soon they would be going <lb n="10099"/>
             home for the holidays. After supper in the <seg type="neologism"> studyhall </seg> he would <lb n="10100"/>
             change the number pasted up inside his desk from <seg type="neologism"> seventyseven </seg> <lb n="10101"/>
             to <seg type="neologism"> seventysix </seg>.<lb n="10102"/> </p>
            <p> It would be better to be in the <seg type="neologism"> studyhall </seg> than out there in the <lb n="10103"/>
             cold. The sky was pale and cold but there were lights in the <lb n="10104"/>
             castle. He wondered from which window <persName> Hamilton Rowan</persName> <lb n="10105"/>
             had thrown his hat on the haha and had there been flowerbeds <lb n="10106"/>
             at that time under the windows. One day when he had been <lb n="10107"/>
             called to the castle the butler had shown him the marks of the <lb n="10108"/>
             soldiers' slugs in the wood of the door and had given him a <lb n="10109"/>
             piece of shortbread that the community ate. It was nice and <lb n="10110"/>
             warm to see the lights in the castle. It was like something in a <lb n="10111"/>
             book. Perhaps <place> <location> <geo> 52.640379 -1.132563 </geo> </location> <placeName> Leicester Abbey </placeName> </place> was like that. And there were <lb n="10112"/>
             nice sentences in <persName> Doctor Cornwell</persName>'s Spelling Book. They were <lb n="10113"/>
             like poetry but they were only sentences to learn the spelling <lb n="10114"/>

            <p> It would be nice to lie on the hearthrug before the fire, <lb n="10120"/>
             leaning his head upon his hands, and think on those sentences. <lb n="10121"/>
             He shivered as if he had cold slimy water next his skin. That <lb n="10122"/>
             was mean of <persName> Wells</persName> to shoulder him into the square ditch be- <lb n="10123"/>

             soned hacking chestnut, the conqueror of forty. How cold and <lb n="10125"/>
             slimy the water had been! A fellow had once seen a big rat <lb n="10126"/>
             jump plop into the scum. He shivered and longed to cry. It <lb n="10127"/>
             would be so nice to be at home. Mother was sitting at the fire <lb n="10128"/>
             with <persName> Dante </persName> waiting for <persName> Brigid </persName> to bring in the tea. She had her <lb n="10129"/>

             <persName> Dante </persName> because he was a priest but both his father and <persName> uncle <lb n="10135"/>
             Charles </persName> said that <persName> Dante </persName> was a clever woman and a <seg type="neologism"> wellread </seg> <lb n="10136"/>
             woman. And when <persName> Dante </persName> made that noise after dinner and <lb n="10137"/>
             then put up her hand to her mouth: that was heartburn.<lb n="10138"/> </p>
            <p> A voice cried far out on the playground:<lb n="10139"/> </p>
            <p> <said who="a voice">―All in! <lb n="10140"/></said> </p>
            <p> Then other voices cried from the lower and third lines:<lb n="10141"/> </p>
            <p> <said who="other voices from the lower and third lines">―All in! All in! <lb n="10142"/> </said> </p>
            <p> The players closed around, flushed and muddy, and he went <lb n="10143"/>
             among them, glad to go in. <persName> Rody Kickham </persName> held the ball by its <lb n="10144"/>
             greasy lace. A fellow asked him to give it one last: but he <lb n="10145"/>
             walked on without even answering the fellow. <persName> Simon Moonan </persName> <lb n="10146"/>
             told him not to because the prefect was looking. The fellow <lb n="10147"/>
             turned to <persName> Simon Moonan </persName> and said:<lb n="10148"/> </p>
            <p> <said who="a fellow">―We all know why you speak. You are <persName> McGlade </persName>'s suck. <lb n="10149"/></said> </p>
            <p> Suck was a queer word. The fellow called <persName> Simon Moonan </persName> <lb n="10150"/>
             that name because <persName> Simon Moonan </persName> used to tie the prefect's false <lb n="10151"/>
             sleeves behind his back and the prefect used to let on to be <lb n="10152"/>
             angry. But the sound was ugly. Once he had washed his hands <lb n="10153"/>
             in the lavatory of the <place> <location> <geo> 53.342872 -6.260651 </geo> </location> <placeName> Wicklow Hotel </placeName> </place> and his father pulled the <lb n="10154"/>
             stopper up by the chain after and the dirty water went down <lb n="10155"/>
             through the hole in the basin. And when it had all gone down <lb n="10156"/>
             slowly the hole in the basin had made a sound like that: suck. <lb n="10157"/>
             Only louder.<lb n="10158"/> </p>
            <p> To remember that and the white look of the lavatory made <lb n="10159"/>
             him feel cold and then hot. There were two cocks that you <lb n="10160"/>
             turned and water came out: cold and hot. He felt cold and then <lb n="10161"/>
             a little hot: and he could see the names printed on the cocks. <lb n="10162"/>
             That was a very queer thing.<lb n="10163"/> </p>
            <p> And the air in the corridor chilled him too. It was queer and <lb n="10164"/>
             wettish. But soon the gas would be lit and in burning it made a <lb n="10165"/>
             light noise like a little song. Always the same: and when the <lb n="10166"/>
             fellows stopped talking in the playroom you could hear it.<lb n="10167"/> </p>
            <p> It was the hour for sums. <persName> Father Arnall </persName> wrote a hard sum on <lb n="10168"/>
             the board and then said:<lb n="10169"/> </p>
            <p> <said who="Father Arnall">―Now then, who will win? Go ahead, York! Go ahead, Lan- <lb n="10170"/>
             caster! <lb n="10171"/></said> </p>
            <p> <persName> Stephen </persName> tried his best but the sum was too hard and he felt <lb n="10172"/>
             confused. The little silk badge with the white rose on it that <lb n="10173"/>
             was pinned on the breast of his jacket began to flutter. He was <lb n="10174"/>
             no good at sums but he tried his best so that York might not <lb n="10175"/>
             lose. <persName> Father Arnall </persName>'s face looked very black but he was not in a <lb n="10176"/>
             wax: he was laughing. Then <persName> Jack Lawton </persName> cracked his fingers <lb n="10177"/>
             and <persName> Father Arnall </persName> looked at his copybook and said:<lb n="10178"/> </p>
            <p> <said who="Father Arnall">―Right. Bravo Lancaster! The red rose wins. Come on now, <lb n="10179"/>
             York! Forge ahead! <lb n="10180"/></said> </p>
            <p> <persName> Jack Lawton </persName> looked over from his side. The little silk badge <lb n="10181"/>
             with the red rose on it looked very rich because he had a blue <lb n="10182"/>
             sailor top on. <persName> Stephen </persName> felt his own face red too, thinking of all <lb n="10183"/>
             the bets about who would get first place in elements, <persName> Jack <lb n="10184"/>
             Lawton </persName> or he. Some weeks <persName> Jack Lawton </persName> got the card for first <lb n="10185"/>
             and some weeks he got the card for first. His white silk badge <lb n="10186"/>
             fluttered and fluttered as he worked at the next sum and heard <lb n="10187"/>
             <persName> Father Arnall </persName>'s voice. Then all his eagerness passed away and <lb n="10188"/>
             he felt his face quite cool. He thought his face must be white <lb n="10189"/>
             because it felt so cool. He could not get out the answer for the <lb n="10190"/>
             sum but it did not matter. White roses and red roses: those <lb n="10191"/>
             were beautiful colours to think of. And the cards for first place <lb n="10192"/>
             and second place and third place were beautiful colours too: <lb n="10193"/>
             pink and cream and lavender. Lavender and cream and pink <lb n="10194"/>
             roses were beautiful to think of. Perhaps a wild rose might be <lb n="10195"/>
             like those colours: and he remembered the song about the wild <lb n="10196"/>
             rose blossoms on the little green place. But you could not have <lb n="10197"/>
             a green rose. But perhaps somewhere in the world you could.<lb n="10198"/> </p>
            <p> The bell rang and then the classes began to file out of the <lb n="10199"/>
             rooms and along the corridors towards the refectory. He sat <lb n="10200"/>
             looking at the two prints of butter on his plate but could not <lb n="10201"/>
             eat the damp bread. The tablecloth was damp and limp. But he <lb n="10202"/>
             drank off the hot weak tea which the clumsy scullion, girt with <lb n="10203"/>
             a white apron, poured into his cup. He wondered whether the <lb n="10204"/>
             scullion's apron was damp too or whether all white things were <lb n="10205"/>
             cold and damp. <persName> Nasty Roche </persName> and <persName> Saurin </persName> drank cocoa that their <lb n="10206"/>
             people sent them in tins. They said they could not drink the tea; <lb n="10207"/>
             that it was hogwash. Their fathers were magistrates, the fel- <lb n="10208"/>
             lows said.<lb n="10209"/> </p>
            <p> All the boys seemed to him very strange. They had all fa- <lb n="10210"/>
             thers and mothers and different clothes and voices. He longed <lb n="10211"/>
             to be at home and lay his head on his mother's lap. But he <lb n="10212"/>
             could not: and so he longed for the play and study and prayers <lb n="10213"/>
             to be over and to be in bed.<lb n="10214"/> </p>
            <p> He drank another cup of hot tea and <persName> Fleming </persName> said:<lb n="10215"/> </p>
            <p> <said who="Fleming">―What's up? Have you a pain or what's up with you? <lb n="10216"/></said> </p>
            <p> <said who="Stephen">―I don't know, <persName> Stephen </persName> said. <lb n="10217"/></said> </p>
            <p> <said who="Fleming">―Sick in your breadbasket, <persName> Fleming </persName> said, because your face <lb n="10218"/>
             looks white. It will go away. <lb n="10219"/></said> </p>
            <p> <said who="Stephen">―O yes, <persName> Stephen </persName> said. <lb n="10220"/></said> </p>
            <p> But he was not sick there. He thought that he was sick in his <lb n="10221"/>
             heart if you could be sick in that place. <persName> Fleming </persName> was very <lb n="10222"/>
             decent to ask him. He wanted to cry. He leaned his elbows on <lb n="10223"/>
             the table and shut and opened the flaps of his ears. Then he <lb n="10224"/>
             heard the noise of the refectory every time he opened the flaps <lb n="10225"/>
             of his ears. It made a roar like a train at night. And when he <lb n="10226"/>
             closed the flaps the roar was shut off like a train going into a <lb n="10227"/>
             tunnel. That night at <place> <location> <geo> 53.277911 -6.105844 </geo> </location> <placeName> Dalkey </placeName> </place> the train had roared like that and <lb n="10228"/>
             then, when it went into the tunnel, the roar stopped. He closed <lb n="10229"/>
             his eyes and the train went on, roaring and then stopping; <lb n="10230"/>
             roaring again, stopping. It was nice to hear it roar and stop and <lb n="10231"/>
             then roar out of the tunnel again and then stop.<lb n="10232"/> </p>
            <p> Then the higher line fellows began to come down along the <lb n="10233"/>
             matting in the middle of the refectory, <persName> Paddy Rath </persName> and <persName> Jimmy <lb n="10234"/>
             Magee </persName> and the Spaniard who was allowed to smoke cigars and <lb n="10235"/>
             the little Portuguese who wore the woolly cap. And then the <lb n="10236"/>
             lower line tables and the tables of the third line. And every <lb n="10237"/>
             single fellow had a different way of walking.<lb n="10238"/> </p>
            <p> He sat in a corner of the playroom pretending to watch a <lb n="10239"/>
             game of dominos and once or twice he was able to hear for an <lb n="10240"/>
             instant the little song of the gas. The prefect was at the door <lb n="10241"/>
             with some boys and <persName> Simon Moonan </persName> was knotting his false <lb n="10242"/>
             sleeves. He was telling them something about <place> <location> <geo> 52.888640 -8.428450 </geo> </location> <placeName> Tullabeg </placeName> </place>.<lb n="10243"/> </p>
            <p> Then he went away from the door and <persName> Wells </persName> came over to <lb n="10244"/>
             <persName> Stephen </persName> and said:<lb n="10245"/> </p>
            <p> <said who="Wells">―Tell us, <persName> Dedalus </persName>, do you kiss your mother every night before <lb n="10246"/>
             you go to bed? <lb n="10247"/></said> </p>
            <p> <persName> Stephen </persName> answered:<lb n="10248"/> </p>
            <p> <said who="Stephen">―I do. <lb n="10249"/></said> </p>
            <p> <persName> Wells </persName> turned to the other fellows and said:<lb n="10250"/> </p>
            <p> <said who="Wells">―O, I say, here's a fellow says he kisses his mother every night <lb n="10251"/>
             before he goes to bed. <lb n="10252"/></said> </p>
            <p> The other fellows stopped their game and turned round, <lb n="10253"/>
             laughing. <persName> Stephen </persName> blushed under their eyes and said:<lb n="10254"/> </p>
            <p> <said who="Stephen">―I do not. <lb n="10255"/></said> </p>
            <p> <persName> Wells </persName> said:<lb n="10256"/> </p>
            <p> <said who="Wells">―O, I say, here's a fellow says he doesn't kiss his mother <lb n="10257"/>
             before he goes to bed. <lb n="10258"/></said> </p>
            <p> They all laughed again. <persName> Stephen </persName> tried to laugh with them. <lb n="10259"/>
             He felt his whole body hot and confused in a moment. What <lb n="10260"/>
             was the right answer to the question? He had given two and <lb n="10261"/>
             still <persName> Wells </persName> laughed. But <persName> Wells </persName> must know the right answer for <lb n="10262"/>
             he was in third of grammar. He tried to think of <persName> Wells </persName>'s mother <lb n="10263"/>
             but he did not dare to raise his eyes to <persName> Wells </persName>'s face. He did not <lb n="10264"/>
             like <persName> Wells </persName>'s face. It was <persName> Wells </persName> who had shouldered him into the <lb n="10265"/>
             square ditch the day before because he would not swop his <lb n="10266"/>
             little <seg type="neologism"> snuffbox </seg> for <persName> Wells </persName>'s seasoned hacking chestnut, the con- <lb n="10267"/>
             queror of forty. It was a mean thing to do; all the fellows said it <lb n="10268"/>
             was. And how cold and slimy the water had been! And a fellow <lb n="10269"/>
             had once seen a big rat jump plop into the scum.<lb n="10270"/> </p>
            <p> The cold slime of the ditch covered his whole body; and, <lb n="10271"/>
             when the bell rang for study and the lines filed out of the <lb n="10272"/>
             playrooms, he felt the cold air of the corridor and staircase <lb n="10273"/>
             inside his clothes. He still tried to think what was the right <lb n="10274"/>
             answer. Was it right to kiss his mother or wrong to kiss his <lb n="10275"/>
             mother? What did that mean, to kiss? You put your face up like <lb n="10276"/>
             that to say goodnight and then his mother put her face down. <lb n="10277"/>
             That was to kiss. His mother put her lips on his cheek; her lips <lb n="10278"/>
             were soft and they wetted his cheek; and they made a tiny little <lb n="10279"/>
             noise: kiss. Why did people do that with their two faces?<lb n="10280"/> </p>
            <p> Sitting in the <seg type="neologism"> studyhall </seg> he opened the lid of his desk and <lb n="10281"/>
             changed the number pasted up inside from <seg type="neologism"> seventyseven </seg> to <lb n="10282"/>
             <seg type="neologism"> seventysix </seg>. But the Christmas vacation was very far away: but <lb n="10283"/>
             one time it would come because the earth moved round always.<lb n="10284"/> </p>
            <p> There was a picture of the earth on the first page of his <lb n="10285"/>
             geography: a big ball in the middle of clouds. <persName> Fleming </persName> had a <lb n="10286"/>
             box of crayons and one night during free study he had coloured <lb n="10287"/>
             the earth green and the clouds maroon. That was like the two <lb n="10288"/>
             brushes in <persName> Dante </persName>'s press, the brush with the green velvet back <lb n="10289"/>
             for <persName> Parnell </persName> and the brush with the maroon velvet back for <lb n="10290"/>
             <persName> Michael Davitt </persName>. But he had not told <persName> Fleming </persName> to colour them <lb n="10291"/>
             those colours. <persName> Fleming </persName> had done it himself.<lb n="10292"/> </p>
            <p> He opened the geography to study the lesson; but he could <lb n="10293"/>
             not learn the names of places in <placeName> America </placeName>. Still they were all <lb n="10294"/>
             different places that had those different names. They were all in <lb n="10295"/>
             different countries and the countries were in continents and the <lb n="10296"/>
             continents were in the world and the world was in the universe.<lb n="10297"/> </p>
            <p> He turned to the flyleaf of the geography and read what he <lb n="10298"/>
             had written there: himself, his name and where he was.<lb n="10299"/> </p>

             be a thin thin line there all round everything. It was very big to <lb n="10321"/>
             think about everything and everywhere. Only <persName> God </persName> could do <lb n="10322"/>
             that. He tried to think what a big thought that must be but he <lb n="10323"/>
             could think only of <persName> God </persName>. <persName> God </persName> was <persName> God </persName>'s name just as his name <lb n="10324"/>
             was <persName> Stephen </persName>. <persName> <emph> Dieu </emph> </persName> was the French for <persName> God </persName> and that was <persName> God </persName>'s <lb n="10325"/>
             name too; and when anyone prayed to <persName> God </persName> and said <persName> <emph> Dieu </emph> </persName> then <lb n="10326"/>
             <persName> God </persName> knew at once that it was a French person that was pray- <lb n="10327"/>
              ing. But though there were different names for <persName> God </persName> in all the <lb n="10328"/>
             different languages in the world and <persName> God </persName> understood what all <lb n="10329"/>
             the people who prayed said in their different languages still <lb n="10330"/>
             <persName> God </persName> remained always the same <persName> God </persName> and <persName> God </persName>'s real name was <lb n="10331"/>
             <persName> God </persName>.<lb n="10332"/> </p>
            <p> It made him very tired to think that way. It made him feel <lb n="10333"/>
             his head very big. He turned over the flyleaf and looked wearily <lb n="10334"/>
             at the green round earth in the middle of the maroon clouds. <lb n="10335"/>
             He wondered which was right, to be for the green or for the <lb n="10336"/>
             maroon, because <persName> Dante </persName> had ripped the green velvet back off <lb n="10337"/>
             the brush that was for <persName> Parnell </persName> one day with her scissors and <lb n="10338"/>
             had told him that <persName> Parnell </persName> was a bad man. He wondered if they <lb n="10339"/>
             were arguing at home about that. That was called politics. <lb n="10340"/>
             There were two sides in it: <persName> Dante </persName> was on one side and his <lb n="10341"/>
             father and <persName> Mr Casey </persName> were on the other side but his mother and <lb n="10342"/>
             <persName> uncle Charles </persName> were on no side. Every day there was something <lb n="10343"/>
             in the paper about it.<lb n="10344"/> </p>
            <p> It pained him that he did not know well what politics meant <lb n="10345"/>
             and that he did not know where the universe ended. He felt <lb n="10346"/>
             small and weak. When would he be like the fellows in poetry <lb n="10347"/>
             and rhetoric? They had big voices and big boots and they <lb n="10348"/>
             studied trigonometry. That was very far away. First came the <lb n="10349"/>
             vacation and then the next term and then vacation again and <lb n="10350"/>
             then again another term and then again the vacation. It was <lb n="10351"/>
             like a train going in and out of tunnels and that was like the <lb n="10352"/>
             noise of the boys eating in the refectory when you opened and <lb n="10353"/>
             closed the flaps of the ears. Term, vacation; tunnel, out; noise, <lb n="10354"/>
             stop. How far away it was! It was better to go to bed to sleep. <lb n="10355"/>
             Only prayers in the chapel and then bed. He shivered and <lb n="10356"/>
             yawned. It would be lovely in bed after the sheets got a bit hot. <lb n="10357"/>
             First they were so cold to get into. He shivered to think how <lb n="10358"/>
             cold they were first. But then they got hot and then he could <lb n="10359"/>
             sleep. It was lovely to be tired. He yawned again. Night prayers <lb n="10360"/>
             and then bed: he shivered and wanted to yawn. It would be <lb n="10361"/>
             lovely in a few minutes. He felt a warm glow creeping up from <lb n="10362"/>
             the cold shivering sheets, warmer and warmer till he felt warm <lb n="10363"/>
             all over, ever so warm; ever so warm and yet he shivered a little <lb n="10364"/>
             and still wanted to yawn.<lb n="10365"/> </p>
            <p> The bell rang for night prayers and he filed out of the <seg type="neologism"> study- <lb n="10366"/>
             hall </seg> after the others and down the staircase and along the <lb n="10367"/>
             corridors to the chapel. The corridors were darkly lit and the <lb n="10368"/>
             chapel was darkly lit. Soon all would be dark and sleeping. <lb n="10369"/>
             There was cold night air in the chapel and the marbles were the <lb n="10370"/>
             colour the sea was at night. The sea was cold day and night: <lb n="10371"/>
             but it was colder at night. It was cold and dark under the <lb n="10372"/>
             seawall beside his father's house. But the kettle would be on the <lb n="10373"/>
             hob to make punch.<lb n="10374"/> </p>
            <p> The prefect of the chapel prayed above his head and his <lb n="10375"/>
             memory knew the responses:<lb n="10376"/> </p>
            <lg type="prayer">
               <l> <emph> O Lord, open our lips </emph> </l> <lb n="10377"/>
               <l> <emph> And our mouth shall announce Thy praise. </emph> </l> <lb n="10378"/>

               <l> <emph> O Lord, make haste to help us! </emph> </l> <lb n="10380"/>
            </lg>
            <p> There was a cold night smell in the chapel. But it was a holy <lb n="10381"/>
             smell. It was not like the smell of the old peasants who knelt at <lb n="10382"/>
             the back of the chapel at Sunday mass. That was a smell of air <lb n="10383"/>
             and rain and turf and corduroy. But they were very holy peas- <lb n="10384"/>
             ants. They breathed behind him on his neck and sighed as they <lb n="10385"/>
             prayed. They lived in <place> <location> <geo> 53.293785 -6.687040 </geo> </location> <placeName> Clane </placeName>, </place>, a fellow said: there were little <lb n="10386"/>
             cottages there and he had seen a woman standing at the <seg type="neologism"> half- <lb n="10387"/>
             door </seg> of a cottage with a child in her arms, as the cars had come <lb n="10388"/>
             past from <place> <location> <geo> 53.251067 -6.665231 </geo> </location> <placeName> Sallins </placeName> </place>. It would be lovely to sleep for one night in <lb n="10389"/>
             that cottage before the fire of smoking turf, in the dark lit by <lb n="10390"/>
             the fire, in the warm dark, breathing the smell of the peasants, <lb n="10391"/>
             air and rain and turf and corduroy. But, O, the road there <lb n="10392"/>
             between the trees was dark! You would be lost in the dark. It <lb n="10393"/>
             made him afraid to think of how it was.<lb n="10394"/> </p>
            <p> He heard the voice of the prefect of the chapel saying the last <lb n="10395"/>
             prayer. He prayed it too against the dark outside under the <lb n="10396"/>
             trees.<lb n="10397"/> </p>
            <p> <seg type="prayer"> Visit, we beseech Thee, O Lord, this habitation and <lb n="10398"/>
             drive away from it all the snares of the enemy. May <lb n="10399"/>
             Thy holy angels dwell herein to preserve us in peace <lb n="10400"/>
             and may Thy blessing be always upon us through <lb n="10401"/>

            <p> His fingers trembled as he undressed himself in the dormi- <lb n="10403"/>
             tory. He told his fingers to hurry up. He had to undress and <lb n="10404"/>
             then kneel and say his own prayers and be in bed before the gas <lb n="10405"/>
             was lowered so that he might not go to hell when he died. He <lb n="10406"/>
             rolled his stockings off and put on his nightshirt quickly and <lb n="10407"/>
             knelt trembling at his bedside and repeated his prayers quickly <lb n="10408"/>
             quickly fearing that the gas would go down. He felt his shoul- <lb n="10409"/>
            ders shaking as he murmured:<lb n="10410"/> </p>
            <lg type="prayer">
               <l> God bless my father and my mother and spare them to <lb n="10411"/>

               me! </l> <lb n="10416"/>
            </lg>
            <p> He blessed himself and climbed quickly into bed and, tuck- <lb n="10417"/>
             ing the end of the nightshirt under his feet, curled himself to <lb n="10418"/>
             gether under the cold white sheets, shaking and trembling. But <lb n="10419"/>
             he would not go to hell when he died; and the shaking would <lb n="10420"/>
             stop. A voice bade the boys in the dormitory goodnight. He <lb n="10421"/>
             peered out for an instant over the coverlet and saw the yellow <lb n="10422"/>
             curtains round and before his bed that shut him off on all sides. <lb n="10423"/>
             The light was lowered quietly.<lb n="10424"/> </p>
            <p> The prefect's shoes went away. Where? Down the staircase <lb n="10425"/>
             and along the corridors or to his room at the end? He saw the <lb n="10426"/>
             dark. Was it true about the black dog that walked there at night <lb n="10427"/>
             with eyes as big as <seg type="neologism"> carriagelamps </seg>? They said it was the ghost of <lb n="10428"/>
             a murderer. A long shiver of fear flowed over his body. He saw <lb n="10429"/>
             the dark entrance hall of the castle. Old servants in old dress <lb n="10430"/>
             were in the <seg type="neologism"> ironingroom </seg> above the staircase. It was long ago. <lb n="10431"/>
             The old servants were quiet. There was a fire there but the hall <lb n="10432"/>
             was still dark. A figure came up the staircase from the hall. He <lb n="10433"/>
             wore the white cloak of a marshal; his face was pale and <lb n="10434"/>
             strange; he held his hand pressed to his side. He looked out of <lb n="10435"/>
             strange eyes at the old servants. They looked at him and saw <lb n="10436"/>
             their master's face and cloak and knew that he had received his <lb n="10437"/>
             <seg type="neologism"> deathwound </seg>. But only the dark was where they looked: only <lb n="10438"/>
             dark silent air. Their master had received his <seg type="neologism"> deathwound </seg> on <lb n="10439"/>
             the battlefield of <place> <location> <geo> 50.075538 14.437800 </geo> </location> <placeName> Prague </placeName> </place> far away over the sea. He was standing <lb n="10440"/>
             on the field; his hand was pressed to his side; his face was pale <lb n="10441"/>
             and strange and he wore the white cloak of a marshal.<lb n="10442"/> </p>
            <p> O how cold and strange it was to think of that! All the dark <lb n="10443"/>
             was cold and strange. There were pale strange faces there, great <lb n="10444"/>
             eyes like <seg type="neologism"> carriagelamps </seg>. They were the ghosts of murderers, the <lb n="10445"/>
             figures of marshals who had received their <seg type="neologism"> deathwound </seg> on <lb n="10446"/>
             battlefields far away over the sea. What did they wish to say <lb n="10447"/>

            <p> Going home for the holidays! That would be lovely: the <lb n="10451"/>
             fellows had told him. Getting up on the cars in the early wintry <lb n="10452"/>
             morning outside the door of the castle. The cars were rolling <lb n="10453"/>
             on the gravel. Cheers for the rector!<lb n="10454"/> </p>
            <p> Hurray! Hurray! Hurray!<lb n="10455"/> </p>
            <p> The cars drove past the chapel and all caps were raised. <lb n="10456"/>
             They drove merrily along the country roads. The drivers <lb n="10457"/>

             cheered. The peasant women stood at the <seg type="neologism"> halfdoors </seg>, the men <lb n="10461"/>
             stood here and there. The lovely smell there was in the wintry <lb n="10462"/>
             air: the smell of Clane: rain and wintry air and turf smoul- <lb n="10463"/>
             dering and corduroy.<lb n="10464"/> </p>
            <p> The train was full of fellows: a long long chocolate train <lb n="10465"/>
             with cream facings. The guards went to and fro opening, <lb n="10466"/>
             closing, locking, unlocking the doors. They were men in dark <lb n="10467"/>
             blue and silver; they had silvery whistles and their keys made a <lb n="10468"/>
             quick music: click, click: click, click.<lb n="10469"/> </p>
            <p> And the train raced on over the flat lands and past the <place> <location> <geo> 53.230556 -6.866389 </geo> </location> <placeName> Hill <lb n="10470"/>

             went on and on. It knew. There were coloured lanterns in the <lb n="10472"/>
             hall of his father's house and ropes of green branches. There <lb n="10473"/>
             were holly and ivy round the <seg type="neologism"> pierglass </seg> and holly and ivy, green <lb n="10474"/>
             and red, twined round the chandeliers. There were red holly <lb n="10475"/>

             rods, of water being splashed in the basins. There was a noise <lb n="10484"/>
             of rising and dressing and washing in the dormitory: a noise of <lb n="10485"/>
             clapping of hands as the prefect went up and down telling the <lb n="10486"/>
             fellows to look sharp. A pale sunlight showed the yellow cur- <lb n="10487"/>
             tains drawn back, the tossed beds. His bed was very hot and his <lb n="10488"/>
             face and body were very hot.<lb n="10489"/> </p>
            <p> He got up and sat on the side of his bed. He was weak. He <lb n="10490"/>
             tried to pull on his stocking. It had a horrid rough feel. The <lb n="10491"/>

            <p> He crouched down between the sheets, glad of their tepid <lb n="10504"/>
             glow. He heard the fellows talk among themselves about him <lb n="10505"/>
             as they dressed for mass. It was a mean thing to do, to shoulder <lb n="10506"/>
             him into the square ditch, they were saying.<lb n="10507"/> </p>
            <p> Then their voices ceased; they had gone. A voice at his bed <lb n="10508"/>

             a fellow. He shook his head and answered no and felt glad. <lb n="10515"/>
             <persName> Wells </persName> said:<lb n="10516"/> </p>
            <p> <said who="Wells">―I didn't mean to, honour bright. It was only for cod. I'm <lb n="10517"/>
             sorry. <lb n="10518"/></said> </p>
            <p> The face and the voice went away. Sorry because he was <lb n="10519"/>
             afraid. Afraid that it was some disease. Canker was a disease of <lb n="10520"/>
             plants and cancer one of animals: or another different. That <lb n="10521"/>
             was a long time ago then out on the playgrounds in the evening <lb n="10522"/>
             light, creeping from point to point on the fringe of his line, a <lb n="10523"/>
             heavy bird flying low through the grey light. <placeName> Leicester Abbey </placeName> lit <lb n="10524"/>
             up. <persName> Wolsey </persName> died there. The abbots buried him themselves.<lb n="10525"/> </p>
            <p> It was not <persName> Wells </persName>'s face, it was the prefect's. He was not <lb n="10526"/>
             foxing. No, no: he was sick really. He was not foxing. And he <lb n="10527"/>
             felt the prefect's hand on his forehead; and he felt his forehead <lb n="10528"/>
             warm and damp against the prefect's cold damp hand. That <lb n="10529"/>
             was the way a rat felt, slimy and damp and cold. Every rat had <lb n="10530"/>
             two eyes to look out of. Sleek slimy coats, little little feet <lb n="10531"/>
             tucked up to jump, black shiny eyes to look out of. They could <lb n="10532"/>
             understand how to jump. But the minds of rats could not <lb n="10533"/>
             understand trigonometry. When they were dead they lay on <lb n="10534"/>
             their sides. Their coats dried then. They were only dead things.<lb n="10535"/> </p>
            <p> The prefect was there again and it was his voice that was <lb n="10536"/>
             saying that he was to get up, that <persName> Father Minister </persName> had said he <lb n="10537"/>
             was to get up and dress and go to the infirmary. And while he <lb n="10538"/>
             was dressing himself as quickly as he could the prefect said:<lb n="10539"/> </p>
            <p> <said who="the prefect">―We must pack off to <persName> Brother Michael </persName> because we have the <lb n="10540"/>
             collywobbles. Terrible thing to have the collywobbles! How we <lb n="10541"/>
             wobble when we have the collywobbles! <lb n="10542"/></said> </p>
            <p> He was very decent to say that. That was all to make him <lb n="10543"/>
             laugh. But he could not laugh because his cheeks and lips were <lb n="10544"/>
             all shivery: and then the prefect had to laugh by himself.<lb n="10545"/> </p>
            <p> The prefect cried:<lb n="10546"/> </p>
            <p> <said who="the prefect">―Quick march! Hayfoot! Strawfoot! <lb n="10547"/></said> </p>
            <p> They went together down the staircase and along the corri- <lb n="10548"/>
             dor and past the bath. As he passed the door he remembered <lb n="10549"/>
             with a vague fear the warm <seg type="neologism"> turfcoloured </seg> bogwater, the warm <lb n="10550"/>
             moist air, the noise of plunges, the smell of the towels, like <lb n="10551"/>
             medicine.<lb n="10552"/> </p>
            <p> <persName> Brother Michael </persName> was standing at the door of the infirmary <lb n="10553"/>
             and from the door of the dark cabinet on his right came a smell <lb n="10554"/>
             like medicine. That came from the bottles on the shelves. The <lb n="10555"/>
             prefect spoke to <persName> Brother Michael </persName> and <persName> Brother Michael </persName> <lb n="10556"/>
             answered and called the prefect sir. He had reddish hair mixed <lb n="10557"/>
             with grey and a queer look. It was queer that he would always <lb n="10558"/>
             be a brother. It was queer too that you could not call him sir <lb n="10559"/>
             because he was a brother and had a different kind of look. Was <lb n="10560"/>
             he not holy enough or why could he not catch up on the others?<lb n="10561"/> </p>
            <p> There were two beds in the room and in one bed there was a <lb n="10562"/>
             fellow: and when they went in he called out:<lb n="10563"/> </p>
            <p> <said who="Athy">―Hello! It's young <persName> Dedalus </persName>! What's up? <lb n="10564"/></said> </p>
            <p> <said who="Brother Michael">―The sky is up, <persName> Brother Michael </persName> said. <lb n="10565"/></said> </p>
            <p> He was a fellow out of the third of grammar and, while <persName> Stephen </persName> <lb n="10566"/>
             was undressing, he asked <persName> Brother Michael </persName> to bring him a round <lb n="10567"/>
             of buttered toast.<lb n="10568"/> </p>
            <p> <said who="Athy">―Ah, do! he said. <lb n="10569"/></said> </p>
            <p> <said who="Brother Michael">―Butter you up! said <persName> Brother Michael </persName>. You'll get your walking <lb n="10570"/>
             papers in the morning when the doctor comes. <lb n="10571"/></said> </p>
            <p> <said who="Athy">―Will I? the fellow said. I'm not well yet. <lb n="10572"/></said> </p>
            <p> <persName> Brother Michael </persName> repeated:<lb n="10573"/> </p>
            <p> <said who="Athy">―You'll get your walking papers, I tell you. <lb n="10574"/></said> </p>
            <p> He bent down to rake the fire. He had a long back like the <lb n="10575"/>
             long back of a <seg type="neologism"> tramhorse </seg>. He shook the poker gravely and <lb n="10576"/>
             nodded his head at the fellow out of third of grammar.<lb n="10577"/> </p>
            <p> Then <persName> Brother Michael </persName> went away and after a while the fel- <lb n="10578"/>
             low out of third of grammar turned in towards the wall and fell <lb n="10579"/>
             asleep.<lb n="10580"/> </p>
            <p> That was the infirmary. He was sick then. Had they written <lb n="10581"/>
             home to tell his mother and father? But it would be quicker for <lb n="10582"/>
             one of the priests to go himself to tell them. Or he would write <lb n="10583"/>
             a letter for the priest to bring.<lb n="10584"/> </p>
            <lg type="letter">
               <l> <emph> Dear Mother </emph> </l> <lb n="10585"/>
               <l> <emph> I am sick. I want to go home. Please come and take <lb n="10586"/>
               me home. I am in the infirmary. </emph> </l> <lb n="10587"/>
               <l> <emph> Your fond son, </emph> </l> <lb n="10588"/>
               <l> <emph> <persName> Stephen </persName> </emph> </l> <lb n="10589"/>
            </lg>
            <p> How far away they were! There was cold sunlight outside <lb n="10590"/>
             the window. He wondered if he would die. You could die just <lb n="10591"/>
             the same on a sunny day. He might die before his mother came. <lb n="10592"/>
             Then he would have a dead mass in the chapel like the way the <lb n="10593"/>
             fellows had told him it was when <persName> Little </persName> had died. All the fellows would be at the mass, dressed in black, all with sad faces. <lb n="10594"/>
             <persName> Wells </persName> too would be there but no fellow would look at him. The <lb n="10596"/>
             rector would be there in a cope of black and gold and there <lb n="10597"/>
             would be tall yellow candles on the altar and round the cata- <lb n="10598"/>
             falque. And they would carry the coffin out of the chapel <lb n="10599"/>
             slowly and he would be buried in the little graveyard of the <lb n="10600"/>
             community off the main avenue of limes. And <persName> Wells </persName> would be <lb n="10601"/>
             sorry then for what he had done. And the bell would toll <lb n="10602"/>
             slowly.<lb n="10603"/> </p>
            <p> He could hear the tolling. He said over to himself the song <lb n="10604"/>
             that <persName> Brigid </persName> had taught him.<lb n="10605"/> </p>
            <lg type="song">
               <l> <emph> Dingdong! The castle bell! </emph> </l> <lb n="10606"/>
               <l> <emph> Farewell, my mother! </emph> </l> <lb n="10607"/>
               <l> <emph> Bury me in the old churchyard </emph> </l> <lb n="10608"/>

               <l> <emph> And two to carry my soul away. </emph> </l> <lb n="10613"/>
            </lg>
            <p> How beautiful and sad that was! How beautiful the words <lb n="10614"/>
             were where they said <emph> Bury me in the old churchyard </emph>! A tremor <lb n="10615"/>
             passed over his body. How sad and how beautiful! He wanted <lb n="10616"/>
             to cry quietly but not for himself: for the words, so beautiful <lb n="10617"/>
             and sad, like music. The bell! The bell! Farewell! O farewell!<lb n="10618"/> </p>
            <p> The cold sunlight was weaker and <persName> Brother Michael </persName> was <lb n="10619"/>
             standing at his bedside with a bowl of <seg type="neologism"> beeftea </seg>. He was glad for <lb n="10620"/>
             his mouth was hot and dry. He could hear them playing on the <lb n="10621"/>
             playgrounds. It was after lunchtime. And the day was going on <lb n="10622"/>
             in the college just as if he were there.<lb n="10623"/> </p>
            <p> Then <persName> Brother Michael </persName> was going away and the fellow out of <lb n="10624"/>
             third of grammar told him to be sure and come back and tell <lb n="10625"/>
             him all the news in the paper. He told <persName> Stephen </persName> that his name <lb n="10626"/>
             was <persName> Athy </persName> and that his father kept a lot of racehorses that were <lb n="10627"/>
             spiffing jumpers and that his father would give a good tip to <lb n="10628"/>
             <persName> Brother Mi- <lb n="10629"/>
             chael </persName> any time he wanted it because <persName> Brother Michael </persName> was very decent and always told him the news out of the <lb n="10630"/>
             paper they got every day up in the castle. There was every kind <lb n="10631"/>
             of news in the paper: accidents, shipwrecks, sports and politics.<lb n="10632"/> </p>
            <p> <said who="Athy">―Now it is all about politics in the paper, he said. Do your <lb n="10633"/>
             people talk about that too? <lb n="10634"/></said> </p>
            <p> <said who="Stephen">―Yes, <persName> Stephen </persName> said. <lb n="10635"/></said> </p>
            <p> <said who="Athy">―Mine too, he said. <lb n="10636"/></said> </p>
            <p> Then he thought for a moment and said:<lb n="10637"/> </p>
            <p> <said who="Athy">―You have a queer name, <persName> Dedalus </persName>, and I have a queer name <lb n="10638"/>
             too, <place> <location> <geo> 52.991834 -6.985728 </geo> </location> <placeName> <persName> Athy </persName> </placeName> </place>. My name is the name of a town. Your name is like <lb n="10639"/>
             Latin. <lb n="10640"/></said> </p>
            <p> Then he asked:<lb n="10641"/> </p>
            <p> <said who="Athy">―Are you good at riddles? <lb n="10642"/></said> </p>
            <p> <persName> Stephen </persName> answered:<lb n="10643"/> </p>
            <p> <said who="Stephen">―Not very good. <lb n="10644"/></said> </p>
            <p> Then he said:<lb n="10645"/> </p>
            <p> <said who="Athy">―Can you answer me this one? Why is the county <placeName> Kildare </placeName> like <lb n="10646"/>
             the leg of a fellow's breeches? <lb n="10647"/></said> </p>
            <p> <persName> Stephen </persName> thought what could be the answer and then said:<lb n="10648"/> </p>
            <p> <said who="Stephen">―I give it up. <lb n="10649"/></said> </p>
            <p> <said who="Athy">―Because there is a thigh in it, he said. Do you see the joke? <lb n="10650"/>
             <placeName> <persName> Athy </persName> </placeName> is the town in the county <placeName> Kildare </placeName> and a thigh is the other <lb n="10651"/>
             thigh. <lb n="10652"/></said> </p>
            <p> <said who="Stephen">―O, I see, <persName> Stephen </persName> said. <lb n="10653"/></said> </p>
            <p> <said who="Athy">―That's an old riddle, he said. <lb n="10654"/></said> </p>
            <p> After a moment he said:<lb n="10655"/> </p>
            <p> <said who="Athy">―I say! <lb n="10656"/></said> </p>
            <p> <said who="Stephen">―What? asked <persName> Stephen </persName>. <lb n="10657"/></said> </p>
            <p> <said who="Athy">―You know, he said, you can ask that riddle another way? <lb n="10658"/></said> </p>
            <p> <said who="Stephen">―Can you? said <persName> Stephen </persName>. <lb n="10659"/></said> </p>
            <p> <said who="Athy">―The same riddle, he said. Do you know the other way to ask <lb n="10660"/>
             it?<lb n="10661"/></said> </p>
            <p> <said who="Stephen">―No, said <persName> Stephen </persName>. <lb n="10662"/></said> </p>
            <p> <said who="Athy">―Can you not think of the other way? he said. <lb n="10663"/></said> </p>
            <p> He looked at <persName> Stephen </persName> over the bedclothes as he spoke. Then <lb n="10664"/>
             he lay back on the pillow and said:<lb n="10665"/> </p>
            <p> <said who="Athy">―There is another way but I won't tell you what it is. <lb n="10666"/></said> </p>
            <p> Why did he not tell it? His father, who kept the racehorses, <lb n="10667"/>
             must be a magistrate too like <persName> Saurin </persName>'s father and <persName> Nasty Roche </persName>'s <lb n="10668"/>
             father. He thought of his own father, of how he sang songs <lb n="10669"/>
             while his mother played and of how he always gave him a <lb n="10670"/>
             shilling when he asked for sixpence and he felt sorry for him <lb n="10671"/>
             that he was not a magistrate like the other boys' fathers. Then <lb n="10672"/>
             why was he sent to that place with them? But his father had <lb n="10673"/>
             told him that he would be no stranger there because his grand- <lb n="10674"/>
             uncle had presented an address to the liberator there fifty years <lb n="10675"/>
             before. You could know the people of that time by their old <lb n="10676"/>
             dress. It seemed to him a solemn time: and he wondered if that <lb n="10677"/>
             was the time when the fellows in <placeName> Clongowes </placeName> wore blue coats <lb n="10678"/>
             with brass buttons and yellow waistcoats and caps of <seg type="neologism"> rabbit- <lb n="10679"/>
            skin </seg> and drank beer like grownup people and kept greyhounds <lb n="10680"/>
             of their own to course the hares with.<lb n="10681"/> </p>
            <p> He looked at the window and saw that the daylight had <lb n="10682"/>
             grown weaker. There would be cloudy grey light over the play- <lb n="10683"/>
             grounds. There was no noise on the playgrounds. The class <lb n="10684"/>
             must be doing the themes or perhaps <persName> Father Arnall </persName> was reading <lb n="10685"/>
             a legend out of the book.<lb n="10686"/> </p>
            <p> It was queer that they had not given him any medicine. <lb n="10687"/>
             Perhaps <persName> Brother Michael </persName> would bring it back when he came. <lb n="10688"/>
             They said you got stinking stuff to drink when you were in the <lb n="10689"/>
             infirmary. But he felt better now than before. It would be nice <lb n="10690"/>
             getting better slowly. You could get a book then. There was a <lb n="10691"/>
             book in the library about <placeName> Holland </placeName>. There were lovely foreign <lb n="10692"/>
             names in it and pictures of <seg type="neologism"> strangelooking </seg> cities and ships. It <lb n="10693"/>
             made you feel so happy.<lb n="10694"/> </p>
            <p> How pale the light was at the window! But that was nice. <lb n="10695"/>
             The fire rose and fell on the wall. It was like waves. Someone <lb n="10696"/>
             had put coal on and he heard voices. They were talking. It was <lb n="10697"/>
             the noise of the waves. Or the waves were talking among them- <lb n="10698"/>
            selves as they rose and fell.<lb n="10699"/> </p>
            <p> He saw the sea of waves, long dark waves rising and falling, <lb n="10700"/>
             dark under the moonless night. A tiny light twinkled at the <lb n="10701"/>
             pierhead where the ship was entering: and he saw a multitude <lb n="10702"/>
             of people gathered by the waters' edge to see the ship that was <lb n="10703"/>
             entering their harbour. A tall man stood on the deck, looking <lb n="10704"/>
             out towards the flat dark land: and by the light at the pierhead <lb n="10705"/>
             he saw his face, the sorrowful face of <persName> Brother Michael </persName>.<lb n="10706"/> </p>

            <p> <said who="Brother Michael">―He is dead. We saw him lying upon the catafalque. <lb n="10709"/></said> </p>
            <p> A wail of sorrow went up from the people.<lb n="10710"/> </p>

             table was spread. They had come home a little late and still <lb n="10718"/>
             dinner was not ready: but it would be ready in a jiffy, his <lb n="10719"/>
             mother had said. They were waiting for the door to open and <lb n="10720"/>
             for the servants to come in, holding the big dishes covered with <lb n="10721"/>
             their heavy metal covers.<lb n="10722"/> </p>
            <p>  All were waiting: <persName>uncle Charles</persName>, who sat far away in the <lb n="10723"/>
             shadow of the window, <persName>Dante</persName> and <persName>Mr Casey</persName>, who sat in the <lb n="10724"/>

             Dedalus</persName> looked at himself in the <seg type="neologism">pierglass</seg> above the mantel- <lb n="10727"/>
             piece, waxed out his moustache ends and then, parting his <lb n="10728"/>
             coattails, stood with his back to the glowing fire: and still, from <lb n="10729"/>
             time to time, he withdrew a hand from his coattail to wax out <lb n="10730"/>
             one of his moustache ends. <persName>Mr Casey</persName> leaned his head to one <lb n="10731"/>
             side and, smiling, tapped the gland of his neck with his fingers. <lb n="10732"/>
             And <persName>Stephen</persName> smiled too for he knew now that it was not true <lb n="10733"/>
             that <persName>Mr Casey</persName> had a purse of silver in his throat. He smiled to <lb n="10734"/>
             think how the silvery noise which <persName>Mr Casey</persName> used to make had <lb n="10735"/>
             deceived him. And when he had tried to open <persName>Mr Casey</persName>'s hand <lb n="10736"/>
             to see if the purse of silver was hidden there he had seen that <lb n="10737"/>
             the fingers could not be straightened out: and <persName>Mr Casey</persName> had <lb n="10738"/>
             told him that he had got those three cramped fingers making a <lb n="10739"/>

            <p>  <persName>Mr Dedalus</persName> dropped his coattails and went over to the side- <lb n="10751"/>
             sideboard. He brought forth a great stone jar of whisky from the <lb n="10752"/>
             locker and filled the decanter slowly, bending now and then to <lb n="10753"/>
             see how much he had poured in. Then replacing the jar in the <lb n="10754"/>
             locker he poured out a little of the whisky into two glasses, <lb n="10755"/>
             added a little water and came with them back to the fireplace. <lb n="10756"/>
             <said who="Simon Dedalus">―A thimbleful, <persName>John</persName>, he said. Just to whet your appetite. <lb n="10757"/></said> </p>
            <p>  <persName>Mr Casey</persName> took the glass, drank, and placed it near him on <lb n="10758"/>
             the mantelpiece. Then he said: <lb n="10759"/>

            <p>  <persName>Mr Dedalus</persName> laughed loudly. <lb n="10764"/>
             <said who="Simon Dedalus">―Is it <persName>Christy</persName>? he said. There's more cunning in one of those <lb n="10765"/>

            <p>  He inclined his head, closed his eyes, and, licking his lips <lb n="10767"/>
             profusely, began to speak with the voice of the hotel keeper. <lb n="10768"/>
             <said who="Simon Dedalus">―And he has such a soft mouth when he's speaking to you, <lb n="10769"/>

            <p>  <persName>Mr Casey</persName> was still struggling through his fit of coughing and <lb n="10772"/>
             laughter. <persName>Stephen</persName>, seeing and hearing the hotel keeper through <lb n="10773"/>
             his father's face and voice, laughed.<lb n="10774"/> </p>
            <p>  <persName>Mr Dedalus</persName> put up his eyeglass and, staring down at him, <lb n="10775"/>
             said quietly and kindly: <lb n="10776"/>
             <said who="Simon Dedalus">―What are you laughing at, you little puppy, you? <lb n="10777"/></said> </p>
            <p>  The servants entered and placed the dishes on the table. <persName>Mrs <lb n="10778"/>

            <p>  <persName>Mr Dedalus</persName> went to the end of the table and said: <lb n="10781"/>
             <said who="Simon Dedalus">―Now, <persName>Mrs Riordan</persName>, sit over. <persName>John</persName>, sit you down, my hearty. <lb n="10782"/></said> </p>
            <p>  He looked round to where <persName>uncle Charles</persName> sat and said: <lb n="10783"/>
             <said who="Simon Dedalus">―Now then, sir, there's a bird here waiting for you. <lb n="10784"/></said> </p>
            <p>  When all had taken their seats he laid his hand on the cover <lb n="10785"/>
             and then said quickly, withdrawing it: <lb n="10786"/>
             <said who="Simon Dedalus">―Now, <persName>Stephen</persName>. <lb n="10787"/></said> </p>
            <p>  <persName>Stephen</persName> stood up in his place to say the grace before meals:<lb n="10788"/> </p>

             edge with glistening drops.<lb n="10794"/> </p>
            <p>  <persName>Stephen</persName> looked at the plump turkey which had lain, trussed <lb n="10795"/>
             and skewered, on the kitchen table. He knew that his father <lb n="10796"/>
             had paid a guinea for it in <place><location><geo>53.346308 -6.257925</geo></location><placeName>Dunn's of D'Olier Street</placeName></place> and that the <lb n="10797"/>
             man had prodded it often at the breastbone to show how good <lb n="10798"/>
             it was: and he remembered the man's voice when he had said: <lb n="10799"/>
             <said who="the butcher">―Take that one, sir. That's the real Ally Daly. <lb n="10800"/></said> </p>
            <p>  Why did <persName>Mr Barrett</persName> in Clongowes call his pandybat a tur- <lb n="10801"/>
             key? It was not like a turkey. But Clongowes was far away: and <lb n="10802"/>
             the warm heavy smell of turkey and ham and celery rose from <lb n="10803"/>
             the plates and dishes and the great fire was banked high and <lb n="10804"/>
             red in the grate and the green ivy and red holly made you feel <lb n="10805"/>
             so happy and when dinner was ended the big plumpudding <lb n="10806"/>
             would be carried in, studded with peeled almonds and sprigs of <lb n="10807"/>
             holly, with bluish fire running around it and a little green flag <lb n="10808"/>
             flying from the top.<lb n="10809"/> </p>
            <p>  It was his first Christmas dinner and he thought of his little <lb n="10810"/>
             brothers and sisters who were waiting in the nursery, as he had <lb n="10811"/>
             often waited, till the pudding came. The deep low collar and <lb n="10812"/>
             the <place><location><geo>51.487402 -0.607942</geo></location><placeName>Eton</placeName></place> jacket made him feel queer and oldish: and that morn- <lb n="10813"/>
             ing when his mother had brought him down to the parlour, <lb n="10814"/>
             dressed for mass, his father had cried. That was because he was <lb n="10815"/>
             thinking of his own father. And <persName>uncle Charles</persName> had said so too.<lb n="10816"/> </p>
            <p>  <persName>Mr Dedalus</persName> covered the dish and began to eat hungrily. <lb n="10817"/>
             Then he said: <lb n="10818"/>
             <said who="Simon Dedalus">―Poor old Christy, he's nearly lopsided now with roguery. <lb n="10819"/> </said>
             <said who="Mary Dedalus">―<persName>Simon</persName>, said <persName>Mrs Dedalus</persName>, you haven't given <persName>Mrs Riordan</persName> <lb n="10820"/>
             any sauce. <lb n="10821"/></said> </p>
            <p>  <persName>Mr Dedalus</persName> seized the sauceboat. <lb n="10822"/>
             <said who="Simon Dedalus">―Haven't I?  he cried. <persName>Mrs Riordan</persName>, pity the poor blind. <lb n="10823"/></said> </p>
            <p>  <persName>Dante</persName> covered her plate with her hands and said: <lb n="10824"/>
             <said who="Dante">―No, thanks. <lb n="10825"/></said> </p>
            <p>  <persName>Mr Dedalus</persName> turned to <persName>uncle Charles</persName>. <lb n="10826"/>
             <said who="Simon Dedalus">―How are you off, sir? <lb n="10827"/> </said>

            <p>  He poured sauce freely over <persName>Stephen</persName>'s plate and set the boat <lb n="10833"/>

             <persName>Uncle Charles</persName> could not speak because his mouth was full but <lb n="10835"/>
             he nodded that it was. <lb n="10836"/>

            <p>  He heaped up the food on Stephen's plate and served uncle <lb n="10898"/>
             Charles and Mr Casey to large pieces of turkey and splashes of <lb n="10899"/>
             sauce. Mrs Dedalus was eating little and Dante sat with her <lb n="10900"/>
             hands in her lap. She was red in the face. Mr Dedalus rooted <lb n="10901"/>
             with the carvers at the end of the dish and said: <lb n="10902"/>

             eat again.<lb n="10910"/> </p>
            <p>  There was a silence while he ate. Then he said: <lb n="10911"/>

            <p>  He looked round at the others whose faces were bent to- <lb n="10916"/>
             towards their plates and, receiving no reply, waited for a moment <lb n="10917"/>

            <p>  He twisted his features into a grimace of heavy bestiality and <lb n="10932"/>

            <p>  Mrs Dedalus spoke to Dante in a low voice but Dante said <lb n="10955"/>

            <p>  Mr Casey pushed his plate rudely into the middle of the <lb n="10959"/>
             table and, resting his elbows before him, said in a harsh voice <lb n="10960"/>
             to his host: <lb n="10961"/>
             <said who="John Casey">―Tell me, did I tell you that story about a very famous spit? <lb n="10962"/> </said>

             <said who="John Casey">―Why then, said Mr Casey, it is a most instructive story. It <lb n="10964"/>
             happened not long ago in the <place><location><geo> 52.986231 -6.367254</geo></location><placeName>county Wicklow</placeName></place> where we are <lb n="10965"/>
             now. <lb n="10966"/></said> </p>
            <p>  He broke off and, turning towards Dante, said with quiet <lb n="10967"/>
             indignation: <lb n="10968"/>
             <said who="John Casey">―And I may tell you, ma'am, that I, if you mean me, am no <lb n="10969"/>
             renegade catholic. I am a catholic as my father was and his <lb n="10970"/>
             father before him and his father before him again when we <lb n="10971"/>
             gave up our lives rather than sell our faith. <lb n="10972"/> </said>
             <said who="Dante">―The more shame to you now, Dante said, to speak as you <lb n="10973"/>
             do. <lb n="10974"/> </said>
             <said who="Simon Dedalus">―The story, John, said Mr Dedalus smiling. Let us have the <lb n="10975"/>
             story anyhow. <lb n="10976"/> </said>
             <said who="Dante">―Catholic indeed! repeated Dante ironically. The blackest <lb n="10977"/>
             protestant in the land would not speak the language I have <lb n="10978"/>
             heard this evening. <lb n="10979"/></said> </p>
            <p>  Mr Dedalus began to sway his head to and fro, crooning like <lb n="10980"/>
             a country singer. <lb n="10981"/>
             <said who="John Casey">―I am no protestant, I tell you again, said Mr Casey flushing. <lb n="10982"/></said> </p>
            <p>  Mr Dedalus, still crooning and swaying his head, began to <lb n="10983"/>
             sing in a grunting nasal tone: <lb n="10984"/>
            <said who="Simon Dedalus"> <seg type="song">
              <lg>
                 <l>O, come all you Roman catholics</l> <lb n="10985"/>
                 <l>That never went to mass.</l> <lb n="10986"/>
              </lg>
            </seg> </said></p>
            <p>  He took up his knife and fork again in good humour and set <lb n="10987"/>
             to eating, saying to Mr Casey: <lb n="10988"/>
             <said who="Simon Dedalus">―Let us have the story, John. It will help us to digest. <lb n="10989"/></said> </p>
            <p>  Stephen looked with affection at Mr Casey's face which <lb n="10990"/>
             stared across the table over his joined hands. He liked to sit <lb n="10991"/>
             near him at the fire, looking up at his dark fierce face. But his <lb n="10992"/>
             dark eyes were never fierce and his slow voice was good to <lb n="10993"/>
             listen to. But why was he then against the priests? Because <lb n="10994"/>
             Dante must be right then. But he had heard his father say that <lb n="10995"/>
             she was a spoiled nun and that she had come out of the convent <lb n="10996"/>
             in the Alleghanies when her brothers had got the money from <lb n="10997"/>
             the savages for the trinkets and  <seg type="neologism">chainies</seg>. Perhaps that made her <lb n="10998"/>
             severe against Parnell. And she did not like him to play with <lb n="10999"/>
             Eileen because Eileen was a protestant and when she was <lb n="11000"/>
             young she knew children that used to play with protestants and <lb n="11001"/>
             the protestants used to make fun of the litany of the Blessed <lb n="11002"/>
             Virgin. <emph>Tower of Ivory</emph>, they used to say, <emph>House of Gold!</emph> How <lb n="11003"/>
             could a woman be a tower of ivory or a house of gold? Who <lb n="11004"/>
             was right then? And he remembered the evening in the infirm- <lb n="11005"/>
             ary in Clongowes, the dark waters, the light at the pierhead <lb n="11006"/>
             and the moan of sorrow from the people when they had heard.<lb n="11007"/> </p>
            <p>  Eileen had long white hands. One evening when playing tig <lb n="11008"/>
             she had put her hands over his eyes: long and white and thin <lb n="11009"/>
             and cold and soft. That was ivory: a cold white thing. That <lb n="11010"/>
             was the meaning of <emph>Tower of Ivory</emph>. <lb n="11011"/>
             <said who="John Casey">―The story is very short and sweet, Mr Casey said. It was one <lb n="11012"/>
             day down in <place><location><geo>52.797693 -6.159929</geo></location><placeName>Arklow</placeName></place>, a cold bitter day, not long before the <lb n="11013"/>
             chief died. May God have mercy on him! <lb n="11014"/></said> </p>
            <p>  He closed his eyes wearily and paused. Mr Dedalus took a <lb n="11015"/>
             bone from his plate and tore some meat from it with his teeth, <lb n="11016"/>
             saying: <lb n="11017"/>
             <said who="Simon Dedalus">―Before he was killed, you mean. <lb n="11018"/></said> </p>
            <p>  Mr Casey opened his eyes, sighed and went on: <lb n="11019"/>
             <said who="John Casey">―It was down in Arklow one day. We were down there at a <lb n="11020"/>
             meeting and after the meeting was over we had to make our <lb n="11021"/>
             way to the railway station through the crowd. Such booing and <lb n="11022"/>
             baaing, man, you never heard. They called us all the names in <lb n="11023"/>
             the world. Well there was one old lady, and a drunken old <lb n="11024"/>
             harridan she was surely, that paid all her attention to me. She <lb n="11025"/>
             kept dancing along beside me in the mud bawling and scream- <lb n="11026"/>

             <said who="Simon Dedalus">―Well, John? <lb n="11034"/> </said>
             <said who="John Casey">―Well. I let her bawl away to her heart's content <emph>Kitty O'Shea</emph> <lb n="11035"/>
             and the rest of it till at last she called that lady a name that I <lb n="11036"/>

             own lips by repeating. <lb n="11038"/></said> </p>
            <p>  He paused. Mr Dedalus, lifting his head from the bone, <lb n="11039"/>
             asked: <lb n="11040"/>
             <said who="Simon Dedalus">―And what did you do, John? <lb n="11041"/> </said>
             <said who="John Casey">―Do! said Mr Casey. She stuck her ugly old face up at me <lb n="11042"/>
             when she said it and I had my mouth full of tobacco juice. I <lb n="11043"/>
             bent down to her and <emph>Phth!</emph> says I to her like that. <lb n="11044"/></said> </p>
            <p>  He turned aside and made the act of spitting. <lb n="11045"/>

            <p>  He clapped a hand to his eye and gave a hoarse scream of <lb n="11047"/>
             pain. <lb n="11048"/>
             <said who="John Casey">―<emph>O Jesus, Mary and Joseph!</emph> says she. <emph>I'm blinded! I'm <lb n="11049"/>
             blinded and drownded!</emph> <lb n="11050"/></said> </p>
            <p>  He stopped in a fit of coughing and laughter, repeating: <lb n="11051"/>
             <said who="John Casey">―<emph>I'm blinded entirely!</emph><lb n="11052"/></said> </p>
            <p>  Mr Dedalus laughed loudly and lay back in his chair while <lb n="11053"/>
             uncle Charles swayed his head to and fro.<lb n="11054"/> </p>
            <p>  Dante looked terribly angry and repeated while they <lb n="11055"/>

             <said who="Dante">―Very nice! Ha! Very nice! <lb n="11057"/></said> </p>
            <p>  It was not nice about the spit in the woman's eye. But what <lb n="11058"/>
             was the name the woman had called Kitty O'Shea that Mr <lb n="11059"/>
             Casey would not repeat? He thought of Mr Casey walking <lb n="11060"/>
             through the crowds of people and making speeches from a <lb n="11061"/>
             wagonette. That was what he had been in prison for and he <lb n="11062"/>
             remembered that one night Sergeant O'Neill had come to the <lb n="11063"/>
             house and had stood in the hall, talking in a low voice with his <lb n="11064"/>
             father and chewing nervously at the chinstrap of his cap. And <lb n="11065"/>
             that night Mr Casey had not gone to <place><location><geo>53.349805 -6.260310 </geo></location><placeName>Dublin</placeName></place> by train but a car <lb n="11066"/>
             had come to the door and he had heard his father say some- <lb n="11067"/>
             something about <place><location><geo>53.265647 -6.156109</geo></location><placeName>the Cabinteely road</placeName></place>.<lb n="11068"/> </p>
            <p>  He was for Ireland and Parnell and so was his father: and so <lb n="11069"/>
             was Dante too for one night at the band on the esplanade she <lb n="11070"/>
             had hit a gentleman on the head with her umbrella because he <lb n="11071"/>
             had taken off his hat when the band played <emph>God save the <lb n="11072"/>
             Queen</emph> at the end.<lb n="11073"/> </p>
            <p>  Mr Dedalus gave a snort of contempt. <lb n="11074"/>
             <said who="Simon Dedalus">―Ah, John, he said. It is true for them. We are an unfortunate <lb n="11075"/>

             good Irishman when there was no money in the job. He was <lb n="11085"/>
             condemned to death as a whiteboy. But he had a saying about <lb n="11086"/>
             our clerical friends, that he would never let one of them put his <lb n="11087"/>

             <said who="Dante">―A traitor to his country! replied Dante. A traitor, an adul- <lb n="11095"/>

             <said who="John Casey">―Didn't the bishops of Ireland betray us in the time of the <lb n="11101"/>

             the aspirations of this country in 1829 in return for catholic <lb n="11104"/>

            <p>  His face was glowing with anger and Stephen felt the glow <lb n="11108"/>
             rise to his own cheek as the spoken words thrilled him. Mr <lb n="11109"/>
             Dedalus uttered a guffaw of coarse scorn. <lb n="11110"/>
             <said who="John Casey">―O, by God, he cried, I forgot little old Paul Cullen! Another <lb n="11111"/>

            <p>  Dante bent across the table and cried to Mr Casey: <lb n="11113"/>
             <said who="Dante">―Right! Right! They were always right! God and morality and <lb n="11114"/>

             religion before the world! <lb n="11119"/></said> </p>
            <p>  Mr Casey raised his clenched fist and brought it down on <lb n="11120"/>
             the table with a crash. <lb n="11121"/>
             <said who="John Casey">―Very well, then, he shouted hoarsely, if it comes to that, no <lb n="11122"/>
             God for Ireland! <lb n="11123"/> </said>

            <p>  Dante stared across the table, her cheeks shaking. Mr Casey <lb n="11126"/>
             struggled up from his chair and bent across the table towards <lb n="11127"/>
             her, scraping the air from before his eyes with one hand as <lb n="11128"/>
             though he were tearing aside a cobweb. <lb n="11129"/>
             <said who="John Casey">―No God for Ireland! he cried. We have had too much God in <lb n="11130"/>
             Ireland. Away with God! <lb n="11131"/> </said>
             <said who="Dante">―Blasphemer! Devil! screamed Dante, starting to her feet and <lb n="11132"/>
             almost spitting in his face. <lb n="11133"/></said> </p>
            <p>  Uncle Charles and Mr Dedalus pulled Mr Casey back into <lb n="11134"/>
             his chair again, talking to him from both sides reasonably. He <lb n="11135"/>
             stared before him out of his dark flaming eyes, repeating: <lb n="11136"/>
             <said who="John Casey">―Away with God, I say! <lb n="11137"/></said> </p>
            <p>  Dante shoved her chair violently aside and left the table, <lb n="11138"/>
             upsetting her <seg type="neologism">napkinring</seg> which rolled slowly along the carpet <lb n="11139"/>
             and came to rest against the foot of an easychair. Mrs Dedalus <lb n="11140"/>
             rose quickly and followed her towards the door. At the door <lb n="11141"/>
             Dante turned round violently and shouted down the room, her <lb n="11142"/>
             cheeks flushed and quivering with rage: <lb n="11143"/>
             <said who="Dante">―Devil out of hell! We won! We crushed him to death! Fiend! <lb n="11144"/></said> </p>
            <p>  The door slammed behind her.<lb n="11145"/> </p>
            <p>  Mr Casey, freeing his arms from his holders, suddenly <lb n="11146"/>
             bowed his head on his hands with a sob of pain. <lb n="11147"/>
             <said who="John Casey">―Poor Parnell! he cried loudly. My dead king! <lb n="11148"/></said> </p>

            <p>  Stephen, raising his <seg type="neologism">terrorstricken</seg> face, saw that his father's <lb n="11150"/>

             <said who="Fleming">Fleming asked: <lb n="11159"/> </said>

             <said who="Cecil Thunder">―I know why, Cecil Thunder said. Because they had fecked <lb n="11161"/>

             <said who="a fellow">―Who fecked it? <lb n="11163"/> </said>
             <said who="John Casey">―Kickham's brother. And they all went shares in it. <lb n="11164"/></said> </p>
            <p>  But that was stealing. How could they have done that? <lb n="11165"/>
             <said who="Wells">―A fat lot you know about it, Thunder! Wells said. I know <lb n="11166"/>
             why they scut. <lb n="11167"/> </said>
             <said who="a fellow">―Tell us why. <lb n="11168"/> </said>
             <said who="Wells">―I was told not to, Wells said. <lb n="11169"/> </said>
             <said who="all">―O, go on, Wells, all said. You might tell us. We won't let it <lb n="11170"/>
             out. <lb n="11171"/></said> </p>
            <p>  Stephen bent forward his head to hear. Wells looked round <lb n="11172"/>
             to see if anyone was coming. Then he said secretly: <lb n="11173"/>
             <said who="Wells">―You know the altar wine they keep in the press in the sac- <lb n="11174"/>
             risty? <lb n="11175"/> </said>
             <said who="all">―Yes. <lb n="11176"/> </said>
             <said who="Wells">―Well, they drank that and it was found out who did it by the <lb n="11177"/>
             smell. And that's why they ran away, if you want to know. <lb n="11178"/></said> </p>
            <p>  And the fellow who had spoken first said: <lb n="11179"/>
             <said who="a fellow">―Yes, that's what I heard too from the fellow in the higher <lb n="11180"/>
             line. <lb n="11181"/></said> </p>
            <p>  The fellows were all silent. Stephen stood among them, <lb n="11182"/>
             afraid to speak, listening. A faint sickness of awe made him feel <lb n="11183"/>
             weak. How could they have done that? He thought of the dark <lb n="11184"/>
             silent sacristy. There were dark wooden presses there where the <lb n="11185"/>
             crimped surplices lay quietly folded. It was not the chapel but <lb n="11186"/>
             still you had to speak under your breath. It was a holy place. <lb n="11187"/>
             He remembered the summer evening he had been there to be <lb n="11188"/>
             dressed as <seg type="neologism">boatbearer</seg>, the evening of the procession to the little <lb n="11189"/>
             altar in the wood. A strange and holy place. The boy that held <lb n="11190"/>
             the censer had swung it gently to and fro near the door with the <lb n="11191"/>
             silvery cap lifted by the middle chain to keep the coals lighting. <lb n="11192"/>
             That was called charcoal: and it had burned quietly as the <lb n="11193"/>
             fellow had swung it gently and had given off a weak sour smell. <lb n="11194"/>
             And then when all were vested he had stood holding out the <lb n="11195"/>
             boat to the rector and the rector had put a spoonful of incense <lb n="11196"/>
             in  and it had hissed on the red coals.<lb n="11197"/> </p>
            <p>  The fellows were talking together in little groups here and <lb n="11198"/>
             there on the playground. The fellows seemed to him to have <lb n="11199"/>
             grown smaller: that was because a sprinter had knocked him <lb n="11200"/>
             down the day before, a fellow out of second of grammar. He <lb n="11201"/>
             had been thrown by the fellow's machine lightly on the cinder- <lb n="11202"/>
             path and his spectacles had been broken in three pieces and <lb n="11203"/>
             some of the grit of the cinders had gone into his mouth.<lb n="11204"/> </p>
            <p>  That was why the fellows seemed to him smaller and farther <lb n="11205"/>
             away and the goalposts so thin and far and the soft grey sky so <lb n="11206"/>
             high up. But there was no play on the football grounds for <lb n="11207"/>
             cricket was coming: and some said that Barnes would be the <lb n="11208"/>
             prof and some said it would be Flowers. And all over the play- <lb n="11209"/>
             playgrounds they were playing rounders and bowling twisters and <lb n="11210"/>
             lobs. And from here and from there came the sounds of the <lb n="11211"/>
             <seg type="neologism">cricket bats</seg> through the soft grey air. They said: pick, pack, <lb n="11212"/>
             pock, puck: like drops of water in a fountain slowly falling in <lb n="11213"/>
             the brimming bowl.<lb n="11214"/> </p>
            <p>  Athy, who had been silent, said quietly: <lb n="11215"/>
             <said who="Athy">―You are all wrong. <lb n="11216"/></said> </p>
            <p>  All turned towards him eagerly. <lb n="11217"/>
             <said who="a fellow">―Why? <lb n="11218"/> </said>
             <said who="a fellow">―Do you know? <lb n="11219"/> </said>
             <said who="a fellow">―Who told you? <lb n="11220"/> </said>
             <said who="a fellow">―Tell us, Athy. <lb n="11221"/></said> </p>
            <p>  Athy pointed across the playground to where Simon <lb n="11222"/>
             Moonan was walking by himself kicking a stone before him. <lb n="11223"/>
             <said who="Athy">―Ask him, he said. <lb n="11224"/></said> </p>
            <p>  The fellows looked there and then said: <lb n="11225"/>
             <said who="a fellow">―Why him? <lb n="11226"/> </said>
             <said who="a fellow">―Is he in it? <lb n="11227"/> </said>
             <said who="a fellow">―Tell us, Athy. Go on. You might if you know. <lb n="11228"/></said> </p>
            <p>  Athy lowered his voice and said: <lb n="11229"/>
             <said who="Athy">―Do you know why those fellows scut? I will tell you but you <lb n="11230"/>
             must not let on you know. <lb n="11231"/></said> </p>
            <p>  He paused for a moment and then said mysteriously: <lb n="11232"/>
             <said who="Athy">―They were caught with Simon Moonan and Tusker Boyle in <lb n="11233"/>
             the square one night. <lb n="11234"/></said> </p>
            <p>  The fellows looked at him and asked: <lb n="11235"/>
             <said who="a fellow">―Caught? <lb n="11236"/> </said>
             <said who="a fellow">―What doing? <lb n="11237"/></said> </p>
            <p>  Athy said: <lb n="11238"/>
             <said who="Athy">―Smugging. <lb n="11239"/></said> </p>
            <p>  All the fellows were silent: and Athy said: <lb n="11240"/>
             <said who="Athy">―And that's why. <lb n="11241"/></said> </p>
            <p>  Stephen looked at the faces of the fellows but they were all <lb n="11242"/>
             looking across the playground. He wanted to ask somebody <lb n="11243"/>
             about it. What did that mean about the smugging in the <lb n="11244"/>
             square? Why did the five fellows out of the higher line run <lb n="11245"/>
             away for that? It was a joke, he thought. Simon Moonan had <lb n="11246"/>
             nice clothes and one night he had shown him a ball of creamy <lb n="11247"/>
             sweets that the fellows of the football fifteen had rolled down <lb n="11248"/>
             to him along the carpet in the middle of the refectory when he <lb n="11249"/>
             was at the door. It was the night of the match against the <lb n="11250"/>
             Bective Rangers and the ball was made just like a red and green <lb n="11251"/>
             apple only it opened and it was full of the creamy sweets. And <lb n="11252"/>
             one day Boyle had said that an elephant had two tuskers in- <lb n="11253"/>
             instead of two tusks and that was why he was called Tusker <lb n="11254"/>
             Boyle but some fellows called him Lady Boyle because he was <lb n="11255"/>
             always at his nails, paring them.<lb n="11256"/> </p>
            <p>  Eileen had long thin cool white hands too because she was a <lb n="11257"/>
             girl. They were like ivory; only soft. That was the meaning of <lb n="11258"/>
             <emph>Tower of Ivory</emph> but protestants could not understand it and <lb n="11259"/>
             made fun of it. One day he had stood beside her looking into <lb n="11260"/>
             the hotel grounds. A waiter was running up a trail of bunting <lb n="11261"/>
             on the flagstaff and a fox terrier was scampering to and fro on <lb n="11262"/>
             the sunny lawn. She had put her hand into his pocket where his <lb n="11263"/>
             hand was and he had felt how cool and thin and soft her hand <lb n="11264"/>
             was. She had said that pockets were funny things to have: and <lb n="11265"/>
             then all of a sudden she had broken away and had run laughing <lb n="11266"/>
             down the sloping curve of the path. Her fair hair had streamed <lb n="11267"/>
             out behind her like gold in the sun. <emph>Tower of Ivory. House of <lb n="11268"/>
             Gold.</emph> By thinking about things you could understand them.<lb n="11269"/> </p>
            <p>  But why in the square? You went there when you wanted to <lb n="11270"/>
             do something. It was all thick slabs of slate and water trickled <lb n="11271"/>
             all day out of tiny pinholes and there was a queer smell of stale <lb n="11272"/>
             water there. And behind the door of one of the  closets there <lb n="11273"/>
             was a drawing in red pencil of a bearded man in a Roman dress <lb n="11274"/>
             with a brick in each hand and underneath was the name of the <lb n="11275"/>
             drawing:<lb n="11276"/> </p>
            <p>  <l><emph>Balbus was building a wall.</emph> </l> <lb n="11277"/> </p>
            <p>  Some fellow had drawn it there for a cod. It had a funny <lb n="11278"/>
             face but it was very like a man with a beard. And on the wall of <lb n="11279"/>
             another closet there was written in backhand  in beautiful writ- <lb n="11280"/>
             ing:<lb n="11281"/> </p>
            <p>  <l>Julius Caesar wrote The Calico Belly. </l> <lb n="11282"/> </p>
            <p>  Perhaps that was why they were there  because it was a place <lb n="11283"/>
             where some fellows wrote things for cod. But all the same it <lb n="11284"/>
             was queer what Athy said and the way he said it. It was not a <lb n="11285"/>
             cod because they had run away. He looked with the others in <lb n="11286"/>
             silence across the playground and began to feel afraid.<lb n="11287"/> </p>
            <p>  At last Fleming said: <lb n="11288"/>
             <said who="Fleming">―And we are all to be punished for what other fellows did? <lb n="11289"/> </said>
             <said who="Cecil Thunder">―I won't come back, see if I do, Cecil Thunder said. Three <lb n="11290"/>
             days' silence in the refectory and sending us up for six and eight <lb n="11291"/>
             every minute. <lb n="11292"/> </said>
             <said who="Wells">―Yes, said Wells. And old Barrett has a new way of twisting <lb n="11293"/>
             the note so that you can't open it and fold it again to see how <lb n="11294"/>
             many ferul#.ä  you are to get. I won't come back too. <lb n="11295"/> </said>
             <said who="Cecil Thunder">―Yes, said Cecil Thunder, and the prefect of studies was in <lb n="11296"/>
             second of grammar this morning. <lb n="11297"/> </said>
             <said who="Fleming">―Let us get up a rebellion, Fleming said. Will we? <lb n="11298"/></said> </p>
            <p>  All the fellows were silent. The air was very silent and you <lb n="11299"/>
             could hear the cricket bats but more slowly than before: pick, <lb n="11300"/>
             pock.<lb n="11301"/> </p>
            <p>  Wells asked: <lb n="11302"/>
             <said who="Wells">―What is going to be done to them? <lb n="11303"/> </said>
             <said who="Athy">―Simon Moonan and Tusker are going to be flogged, Athy <lb n="11304"/>
             said, and the fellows in the higher line got their choice of <lb n="11305"/>
             flogging or being expelled. <lb n="11306"/> </said>
             <said who="a fellow">―And which are they taking? asked the fellow who had <lb n="11307"/>
             spoken first. <lb n="11308"/> </said>
             <said who="Athy">―All are taking expulsion except Corrigan, Athy answered. <lb n="11309"/>
             He's going to be flogged by Mr Gleeson. <lb n="11310"/> </said>
             <said who="Fleming">―Is it Corrigan that big fellow? said Fleming. Why, he'd be <lb n="11311"/>
             able for two of Gleeson! <lb n="11312"/> </said>
             <said who="Cecil Thunder">―I know why, Cecil Thunder said. He is right and the other <lb n="11313"/>
             fellows are wrong because a flogging wears off after a bit but a <lb n="11314"/>
             fellow that has been expelled from college is known all his life <lb n="11315"/>
             on  account of it. Besides Gleeson won't flog him hard. <lb n="11316"/> </said>
             <said who="Fleming">―It's best of his play not to, Fleming said. <lb n="11317"/> </said>
             <said who="Cecil Thunder">―I wouldn't like to be Simon Moonan and Tusker,  Cecil <lb n="11318"/>
             Thunder said. But I don't believe they will be flogged. Perhaps <lb n="11319"/>
             they will be sent up for twice nine. <lb n="11320"/> </said>
             <said who="Athy">―No, no, said Athy. They'll both get it on the vital spot. <lb n="11321"/></said> </p>
            <p>  Wells rubbed himself and said in a crying voice: <lb n="11322"/>
             <said who="Wells">―Please, sir, let me off! <lb n="11323"/></said> </p>
            <p>  Athy grinned and turned up the sleeves of his jacket, saying: <lb n="11324"/>
            <said who="Athy"> <seg type="chant">
              <lg>
                 <l>It can't be helped;</l> <lb n="11325"/>
                 <l>It must be done.</l> <lb n="11326"/>
                 <l>So down with your breeches</l> <lb n="11327"/>
                 <l>And out with your bum.</l> <lb n="11328"/>
              </lg>
            </seg> </said></p>
            <p>  The fellows laughed; but he felt that they were a little afraid. <lb n="11329"/>
             In the silence of the soft grey air he heard the cricket bats from <lb n="11330"/>
             here and from there: pock. That was a sound to hear but if you <lb n="11331"/>
             were hit then you would feel a pain. The pandybat made a <lb n="11332"/>
             sound too but not like that. The fellows said it was made of <lb n="11333"/>
             whalebone and leather with lead inside: and he wondered what <lb n="11334"/>
             was the pain like. There were different kinds of pains  for all the <lb n="11335"/>
             different kinds of sounds. A long thin cane would have a high <lb n="11336"/>
             whistling sound and he wondered what was that pain like. It <lb n="11337"/>
             made him shivery to think of it and cold: and what Athy said <lb n="11338"/>
             too. But what was there to laugh at in it? It made him shivery: <lb n="11339"/>
             but that was because you always felt like a shiver when you let <lb n="11340"/>
             down your trousers. It was the same in the bath when you <lb n="11341"/>
             undressed yourself. He wondered who had to let them down, <lb n="11342"/>
             the master or the boy himself. O how could they laugh about it <lb n="11343"/>
             that way?<lb n="11344"/> </p>
            <p>  He looked at Athy's <seg type="neologism">rolledup</seg> sleeves and knuckly inky <lb n="11345"/>
             hands. He had rolled up his sleeves to show how Mr Gleeson <lb n="11346"/>
             would roll up his sleeves. But Mr Gleeson had round shiny <lb n="11347"/>
             cuffs and clean white wrists and fattish white hands and the <lb n="11348"/>
             nails of them were long and pointed. Perhaps he pared them <lb n="11349"/>
             too like Lady Boyle. But they were terribly long and pointed <lb n="11350"/>
             nails. So long and cruel they were though the white fattish <lb n="11351"/>
             hands were not cruel but gentle. And though he trembled with <lb n="11352"/>
             cold and fright to think of the cruel long nails and of the high <lb n="11353"/>
             whistling sound of the cane and of the chill you felt at the end <lb n="11354"/>
             of your shirt when you undressed yourself yet he felt a feeling <lb n="11355"/>
             of queer quiet pleasure inside him to think of the white fattish <lb n="11356"/>
             hands, clean and strong  and gentle. And he thought of what <lb n="11357"/>
             Cecil Thunder had said; that Mr Gleeson would not flog Cor- <lb n="11358"/>
             Corrigan hard. And Fleming had said he would not because it was <lb n="11359"/>
             best of his play not to. But that was not why.<lb n="11360"/> </p>
            <p>  A voice from far out on the playgrounds cried: <lb n="11361"/>
             <said who="a fellow">―All in! <lb n="11362"/></said> </p>
            <p>  And other voices cried: <lb n="11363"/>
             <said who="other voices">―All in! All in! <lb n="11364"/></said> </p>
            <p>  During the writing lesson he sat with his arms folded, listen- <lb n="11365"/>
             ing to the slow scraping of the pens. Mr Harford went to and <lb n="11366"/>
             fro making little signs in red pencil and sometimes sitting <lb n="11367"/>
             beside the boy to show him how to hold the pen. He had tried <lb n="11368"/>
             to spell out the headline for himself though he knew already <lb n="11369"/>
             what it was for it was the last in the book. <emph>Zeal without <lb n="11370"/>
             prudence is like a ship adrift.</emph> But the lines of the letters were <lb n="11371"/>
             like fine invisible threads and it was only by closing his right <lb n="11372"/>
             eye tight tight and staring out of the left eye that he could make <lb n="11373"/>
             out the full curves of the capital.<lb n="11374"/> </p>
            <p>  But Mr Harford was very decent and never got into a wax. <lb n="11375"/>
             All the other masters got into dreadful waxes. But why were <lb n="11376"/>
             they to suffer for what fellows in the higher line did? Wells had <lb n="11377"/>
             said that they had drunk some of the altar wine out of the press <lb n="11378"/>
             in the sacristy and that it had been found out who had done it <lb n="11379"/>
             by the smell. Perhaps they had stolen a monstrance to run away <lb n="11380"/>
             with it and sell it somewhere. That must have been a terrible <lb n="11381"/>
             sin, to go in  quietly there at night, to open the dark press and <lb n="11382"/>
             steal the flashing gold thing into which God was put on the <lb n="11383"/>
             altar in the middle of flowers and candles at benediction while <lb n="11384"/>
             the incense went up in clouds at both sides as the fellow swung <lb n="11385"/>
             the censer and Dominic Kelly sang the first part by himself in <lb n="11386"/>
             the choir. But God was not in it of course when they stole it. <lb n="11387"/>
             But still it was a strange and a great sin even to touch it. He <lb n="11388"/>
             thought of it with deep awe; a terrible and strange sin: it <lb n="11389"/>
             thrilled him to think of it in the silence when the pens scraped <lb n="11390"/>
             lightly. But to drink the altar wine out of the press and be <lb n="11391"/>
             found out by the smell was a sin too: but it was not terrible <lb n="11392"/>
             and strange. It only made you feel a little sickish on account <lb n="11393"/>
             of the smell of the wine. Because on the day when he had <lb n="11394"/>
             made his first holy communion in  the chapel he had shut his <lb n="11395"/>
             eyes and opened his mouth and put out his tongue a little: and <lb n="11396"/>
             when the rector had stooped down to give him the holy com- <lb n="11397"/>
             communion he had smelt a faint winy smell off the rector's breath <lb n="11398"/>
             after the wine of the mass. The word was beautiful: wine. It <lb n="11399"/>
             made you think of dark purple because the grapes were dark <lb n="11400"/>
             purple that grew in Greece outside houses like white temples. <lb n="11401"/>
             But the faint smell off the rector's breath had made him feel <lb n="11402"/>
             a sick feeling on the morning of his first communion. The day <lb n="11403"/>
             of your first communion was the happiest day of your life. <lb n="11404"/>
             And once a lot of generals had asked Napoleon what was the <lb n="11405"/>
             happiest day of his life. They thought he would say the day <lb n="11406"/>
             he won some great battle or the day he was made an emperor. <lb n="11407"/>
             But he said: <lb n="11408"/>
             <said who="Napoleon">―Gentlemen, the happiest day of my life was the day on which <lb n="11409"/>
             I made my first holy communion. <lb n="11410"/></said> </p>
            <p>  Father Arnall came in and the Latin lesson began and he <lb n="11411"/>
             remained still, leaning on the desk with his arms folded. Father <lb n="11412"/>
             Arnall gave out the <seg type="neologism">themebooks</seg> and he said that they were <lb n="11413"/>
             scandalous and that they were all to be written out again with <lb n="11414"/>
             the corrections at once. But the worst of all was Fleming's <lb n="11415"/>
             theme because the pages were stuck together by a blot: and <lb n="11416"/>
             Father Arnall held it up by a corner and said it was an insult to <lb n="11417"/>
             any master to send him up such a theme. Then he asked Jack <lb n="11418"/>
             Lawton to decline the noun <emph>mare</emph> and Jack Lawton stopped at <lb n="11419"/>
             the ablative singular and could not go on with the plural. <lb n="11420"/>
             <said who="Father Arnall">―You should be ashamed of yourself, said Father Arnall <lb n="11421"/>
             sternly. You, the leader of the class! <lb n="11422"/></said> </p>
            <p>  Then he asked the next boy and the next and the next. <lb n="11423"/>
             Nobody knew. Father Arnall became very quiet, more and <lb n="11424"/>
             more quiet as each boy tried to answer and could not. But his <lb n="11425"/>
             face was <seg type="neologism">blacklooking</seg> and his eyes were staring though his <lb n="11426"/>
             voice was so quiet. Then he asked Fleming and Fleming said <lb n="11427"/>
             that that word had no plural. Father Arnall suddenly shut the <lb n="11428"/>
             book and shouted at him: <lb n="11429"/>
             <said who="Father Arnall">―Kneel out there in the middle of the class. You are one of the <lb n="11430"/>
             idlest boys I ever met. Copy out your themes again the rest of <lb n="11431"/>
             you. <lb n="11432"/></said> </p>
            <p>  Fleming moved heavily out of his place and knelt between <lb n="11433"/>
             the two last benches. The other boys bent over their theme- <lb n="11434"/>
             books and began to write. A silence filled the classroom and <lb n="11435"/>
             Stephen, glancing timidly at Father Arnall's dark face, saw that <lb n="11436"/>
             it was a little red from the wax he was in.<lb n="11437"/> </p>
            <p>  Was that a sin for Father Arnall to be in a wax or was he <lb n="11438"/>
             allowed to get into a wax when the boys were idle because that <lb n="11439"/>
             made them study better or was he only letting on to be in a <lb n="11440"/>
             wax? It was because he was allowed because a priest would <lb n="11441"/>
             know what a sin was and would not do it. But if he did it one <lb n="11442"/>
             time by mistake what would he do to go to confession? Perhaps <lb n="11443"/>
             he would go to confession to the minister. And if the minister <lb n="11444"/>
             did it he would go to the rector: and the rector to the provin- <lb n="11445"/>
             cial: and the provincial to the general of the jesuits. That was <lb n="11446"/>
             called the order: and he had heard his father say that they were <lb n="11447"/>
             all clever men. They could all have become <seg type="neologism">highup</seg> people in <lb n="11448"/>
             the world if they had not become jesuits. And he wondered <lb n="11449"/>
             what Father Arnall and Paddy Barrett would have become and <lb n="11450"/>
             what Mr McGlade and Mr Gleeson would have become if they <lb n="11451"/>
             had not become jesuits. It was hard to think what because you <lb n="11452"/>
             would have to think of them in a different way with different <lb n="11453"/>
             coloured coats and trousers and with beards and moustaches <lb n="11454"/>
             and different kinds of hats.<lb n="11455"/> </p>
            <p>  The door opened quietly and closed. A quick whisper ran <lb n="11456"/>
             through the class: the prefect of studies. There was an instant <lb n="11457"/>
             of dead silence and then the loud crack of a pandybat on the <lb n="11458"/>
             last desk. Stephen's heart leapt up in fear. <lb n="11459"/>
             <said who="Father Dolan">―Any boys want flogging here, Father Arnall? cried the pre- <lb n="11460"/>
             fect of studies. Any lazy idle loafers that want flogging in this <lb n="11461"/>
             class? <lb n="11462"/></said> </p>
            <p>  He came to the middle of the class and saw Fleming on his <lb n="11463"/>
             knees. <lb n="11464"/>
             <said who="Father Dolan">―Hoho! he cried. Who is this boy? Why is he on his knees? <lb n="11465"/>
             What is your name, boy? <lb n="11466"/> </said>
             <said who="Fleming">―Fleming, sir. <lb n="11467"/> </said>
             <said who="Father Dolan">―Hoho, Fleming! An idler of course. I can see it in your eye. <lb n="11468"/>
             Why is he on his knees, Father Arnall? <lb n="11469"/> </said>
             <said who="Father Arnall">―He wrote a bad Latin theme, Father Arnall said, and he <lb n="11470"/>
             missed all the questions in grammar. <lb n="11471"/> </said>
             <said who="Father Dolan">―Of course he did! cried the prefect of studies. Of course he <lb n="11472"/>
             did! A born idler! I can see it in the corner of his eye. <lb n="11473"/></said> </p>
            <p>  He banged his pandybat down on the desk and cried: <lb n="11474"/>
             <said who="Father Dolan">―Up, Fleming! Up, my boy! <lb n="11475"/></said> </p>
            <p>  Fleming stood up slowly. <lb n="11476"/>
             <said who="Father Dolan">―Hold out! cried the prefect of studies. <lb n="11477"/></said> </p>
            <p>  Fleming held out his hand. The pandybat came down on it <lb n="11478"/>
             with a loud smacking sound: one, two, three, four, five, six. <lb n="11479"/>
             <said who="Father Dolan">―Other hand! <lb n="11480"/></said> </p>
            <p>  The pandybat came down again in six loud quick smacks. <lb n="11481"/>
             <said who="Father Dolan">―Kneel down! cried the prefect of studies. <lb n="11482"/></said> </p>
            <p>  Fleming knelt down squeezing his hands under his armpits, <lb n="11483"/>
             his face contorted with pain, but Stephen knew how hard his <lb n="11484"/>
             hands were because Fleming was always rubbing rosin into <lb n="11485"/>
             them. But perhaps he was in great pain for the noise of the <lb n="11486"/>
             pandies was terrible. Stephen's heart was beating and flutter- <lb n="11487"/>
             ing. <lb n="11488"/>
             <said who="Father Dolan">―At your work, all of you! shouted the prefect of studies. We <lb n="11489"/>
             want no lazy idle loafers here, lazy idle little schemers. At your <lb n="11490"/>
             work, I tell you. Father Dolan will be in to see you every day. <lb n="11491"/>
             Father Dolan will be in tomorrow. <lb n="11492"/></said> </p>
            <p>  He poked one of the boys in the side with the pandybat, <lb n="11493"/>
             saying: <lb n="11494"/>
             <said who="Father Dolan">―You, boy! When will Father Dolan be in again? <lb n="11495"/> </said>
             <said who="Tom Furlong">―Tomorrow, sir, said Tom Furlong's voice. <lb n="11496"/> </said>
             <said who="Father Dolan">―Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow, said the prefect of <lb n="11497"/>
             studies. Make up your minds for that. Every day Father Dolan. <lb n="11498"/>
             Write away. You, boy, who are you? <lb n="11499"/></said> </p>
            <p>  Stephen's heart jumped suddenly. <lb n="11500"/>
             <said who="Stephen">―Dedalus, sir. <lb n="11501"/> </said>
             <said who="Father Dolan">―Why are you not writing like the others? <lb n="11502"/> </said>
             <said who="Stephen">―I ..... my ... <lb n="11503"/></said> </p>
            <p>  He could not speak with fright. <lb n="11504"/>
             <said who="Father Dolan">―Why is he not writing, Father Arnall? <lb n="11505"/> </said>
             <said who="Father Arnall">―He broke his glasses, said Father Arnall, and I exempted him <lb n="11506"/>
             from work. <lb n="11507"/> </said>
             <said who="Father Dolan">―Broke? What is this I hear? What is this your name is? said <lb n="11508"/>
             the prefect of studies. <lb n="11509"/> </said>
             <said who="Stephen">―Dedalus, sir. <lb n="11510"/> </said>
             <said who="Father Dolan">―Out here, Dedalus. Lazy little schemer. I see schemer in your <lb n="11511"/>
             face. Where did you break your glasses? <lb n="11512"/></said> </p>
            <p>  Stephen stumbled into the middle of the class, blinded by <lb n="11513"/>
             fear and haste. <lb n="11514"/>
             <said who="Father Dolan">―Where did you break your glasses? repeated the prefect of <lb n="11515"/>
             studies. <lb n="11516"/> </said>
             <said who="Stephen">―The <seg type="neologism">cinderpath</seg>, sir. <lb n="11517"/> </said>
             <said who="Father Dolan">―Hoho! The <seg type="neologism">cinderpath</seg>! cried the prefect of studies. I know <lb n="11518"/>
             that trick. <lb n="11519"/></said> </p>
            <p>  Stephen lifted his eyes in wonder and saw for a moment <lb n="11520"/>
             Father Dolan's <seg type="neologism">whitegrey</seg> not young face, his baldy <seg type="neologism">whitegrey</seg> <lb n="11521"/>
             head with fluff at the sides of it, the steel rims of his spectacles <lb n="11522"/>
             and his <seg type="neologism">nocoloured</seg> eyes looking through the glasses. Why did <lb n="11523"/>
             he say that he knew that trick? <lb n="11524"/>
             <said who="Father Dolan">―Lazy idle little loafer! cried the prefect of studies. Broke my <lb n="11525"/>
             glasses! An old schoolboy trick! Out with your hand this mo- <lb n="11526"/>
             moment! <lb n="11527"/></said> </p>
            <p>  Stephen closed his eyes and held out in the air his trembling <lb n="11528"/>
             hand with the palm upwards. He felt the prefect of studies <lb n="11529"/>
             touch it for a moment at the fingers to straighten it and then <lb n="11530"/>
             the swish of the sleeve of the soutane as the pandybat was lifted <lb n="11531"/>
             to strike. A hot burning stinging tingling blow like the loud <lb n="11532"/>
             crack of a broken stick made his trembling hand crumple to- <lb n="11533"/>
             together like a leaf in the fire: and at the sound and the pain <lb n="11534"/>
             scalding tears were driven into his eyes. His whole body was <lb n="11535"/>
             shaking with fright, his arm was shaking and his crumpled <lb n="11536"/>
             burning livid hand shook like a loose leaf in the air. A cry <lb n="11537"/>
             sprang to his lips, a prayer to be let off. But though the tears <lb n="11538"/>
             scalded his eyes and his limbs quivered with pain and fright he <lb n="11539"/>
             held back the hot tears and the cry that scalded his throat. <lb n="11540"/>
             <said who="Father Dolan">―Other hand! shouted the prefect of studies. <lb n="11541"/></said> </p>
            <p>  Stephen drew back his maimed and quivering right arm and <lb n="11542"/>
             held out his left hand. The soutane sleeve swished again as the <lb n="11543"/>
             pandybat was lifted and a loud crashing sound and a fierce <lb n="11544"/>
             maddening tingling burning pain made his hand shrink to- <lb n="11545"/>
             together with the palms and fingers in a livid quivering mass. The <lb n="11546"/>
             scalding water burst forth from his eyes and, burning with <lb n="11547"/>
             shame and agony and fear, he drew back his shaking arm in <lb n="11548"/>
             terror and burst out into a whine of pain. His body shook with <lb n="11549"/>
             a palsy of fright and in shame and rage he felt the scalding cry <lb n="11550"/>
             come from his throat and the scalding tears falling out of his <lb n="11551"/>
             eyes and down his flaming cheeks. <lb n="11552"/>
             <said who="Father Dolan">―Kneel down! cried the prefect of studies. <lb n="11553"/></said> </p>
            <p>  Stephen knelt down quickly pressing his beaten hands to his <lb n="11554"/>
             sides. To think of them  beaten and swollen with pain all in a <lb n="11555"/>
             moment made him feel so sorry for them as if they were not his <lb n="11556"/>
             own but someone else's that he felt so sorry for. And as he <lb n="11557"/>
             knelt, calming the last sobs in his throat and feeling the burning <lb n="11558"/>
             tingling pain pressed in to his sides, he thought of the hands <lb n="11559"/>
             which he had held out in the air with the palms up and of the <lb n="11560"/>
             firm touch of the prefect of studies when he had steadied the <lb n="11561"/>
             shaking fingers and of the beaten swollen reddened mass of <lb n="11562"/>
             palm and fingers that shook helplessly  in the air. <lb n="11563"/>
             <said who="Father Dolan">―Get at your work, all of you, cried the prefect of studies <lb n="11564"/>
             from the door. Father Dolan will be in every day to see if any <lb n="11565"/>
             boy, any lazy idle little loafer wants flogging. Every day. Every <lb n="11566"/>
             day. <lb n="11567"/></said> </p>
            <p>  The door closed behind him.<lb n="11568"/> </p>
            <p>  The hushed class continued to copy out the themes. Father <lb n="11569"/>
             Arnall rose from his seat and went among them, helping the <lb n="11570"/>
             boys with gentle words and telling them the mistakes they had <lb n="11571"/>
             made. His voice was very gentle and soft. Then he returned to <lb n="11572"/>
             his seat and said to Fleming and Stephen: <lb n="11573"/>
             <said who="Father Arnall">―You may return to your places, you two. <lb n="11574"/></said> </p>
            <p>  Fleming and Stephen rose and, walking to their seats, sat <lb n="11575"/>
             down. Stephen, scarlet with shame, opened a book quickly <lb n="11576"/>
             with one weak hand and bent down upon it, his face close to <lb n="11577"/>
             the page.<lb n="11578"/> </p>
            <p>  It was unfair and cruel: because the doctor had told him not <lb n="11579"/>
             to read without glasses and he had written home to his father <lb n="11580"/>
             that morning to send him a new pair. And Father Arnall had <lb n="11581"/>
             said that he need not study till the new glasses came. Then to <lb n="11582"/>
             be called a schemer before the class and to be pandied when he <lb n="11583"/>
             always got the card for first or second and was the leader of the <lb n="11584"/>
             Yorkists! How could the prefect of studies know that it was a <lb n="11585"/>
             trick? He felt the touch of the prefect's fingers as they had <lb n="11586"/>
             steadied his hand and at first he had thought that he was going <lb n="11587"/>
             to shake hands with him because the fingers were soft and firm: <lb n="11588"/>
             but then in an instant he had heard the swish of the soutane <lb n="11589"/>
             sleeve and the crash. It was cruel and unfair to make him kneel <lb n="11590"/>
             in the middle of the class then: and Father Arnall had told them <lb n="11591"/>
             both that they might return to their places without making any <lb n="11592"/>
             difference between them. He listened to Father Arnall's low <lb n="11593"/>
             and gentle voice as he corrected the themes. Perhaps he was <lb n="11594"/>
             sorry now and wanted to be decent. But it was unfair and cruel. <lb n="11595"/>
             The prefect of studies was a priest but that was cruel and <lb n="11596"/>
             unfair. And his <seg type="neologism">whitegrey</seg> face and the <seg type="neologism">nocoloured</seg> eyes behind <lb n="11597"/>
             the <seg type="neologism">steelrimmed</seg> spectacles were cruel looking because he had <lb n="11598"/>
             steadied the hand first with his firm soft fingers and that was to <lb n="11599"/>
             hit it better and louder. <lb n="11600"/>
             <said who="Fleming">―It's a stinking mean thing, that's what it is, said Fleming in <lb n="11601"/>
             the corridor as the classes were passing out in file to the refec- <lb n="11602"/>
             tory, to pandy a fellow for what is not his fault. <lb n="11603"/> </said>
             <said who="Nasty Roche">―You really broke your glasses by accident, didn't you? Nasty <lb n="11604"/>
             Roche asked. <lb n="11605"/></said> </p>
            <p>  Stephen felt his heart filled by Fleming's words and did not <lb n="11606"/>
             answer. <lb n="11607"/>
             <said who="Fleming">―Of course he did! said Fleming. I wouldn't stand it. I'd go up <lb n="11608"/>
             and tell the rector on him. <lb n="11609"/> </said>
             <said who="Cecil Thunder">―Yes, said Cecil Thunder eagerly, and I saw him lift the <lb n="11610"/>
             pandybat over his shoulder and he's not allowed to do that. <lb n="11611"/> </said>
             <said who="Nasty Roche">―Did they hurt much? Nasty Roche asked. <lb n="11612"/> </said>
             <said who="Stephen">―Very much, Stephen said. <lb n="11613"/> </said>
             <said who="Fleming">―I wouldn't stand it, Fleming repeated, from Baldyhead or <lb n="11614"/>
             any other Baldyhead. It's a stinking mean low trick, that's what <lb n="11615"/>
             it is. I'd go up straight up to the rector and tell him about it <lb n="11616"/>
             after dinner. <lb n="11617"/> </said>
             <said who="Cecil Thunder">―Yes, do. Yes, do, said Cecil Thunder. <lb n="11618"/> </said>
             <said who="Nasty Roche">―Yes, do. Yes, go up and tell the rector on him, Dedalus, said <lb n="11619"/>
             Nasty Roche, because he said that he'd come in tomorrow <lb n="11620"/>
             again to pandy you. <lb n="11621"/> </said>
             <said who="all">―Yes, yes. Tell the rector, all said. <lb n="11622"/></said> </p>
            <p>  And there were some fellows out of second of grammar lis- <lb n="11623"/>
             listening and one of them said: <lb n="11624"/>
             <said who="some fellows out of second of grammar">―The senate and the Roman people declared that Dedalus had <lb n="11625"/>
             been wrongly punished. <lb n="11626"/></said> </p>
            <p>  It was wrong; it was unfair and cruel: and, as he sat in the <lb n="11627"/>
             refectory, he suffered time after time in memory the same hu- <lb n="11628"/>
             humiliation until he began to wonder whether it might not really <lb n="11629"/>
             be that there was something in his face which made him look <lb n="11630"/>
             like a schemer and he wished he had a little mirror to see. But <lb n="11631"/>
             there could not be; and it was unjust and cruel and unfair.<lb n="11632"/> </p>
            <p>  He could not eat the blackish fish fritters they got on <lb n="11633"/>
             Wednesdays in lent and one of his potatoes had the mark of the <lb n="11634"/>
             spade in it. Yes, he would do what the fellows had told him. He <lb n="11635"/>
             would go up and tell the rector that he had been wrongly <lb n="11636"/>
             punished. A thing like that had been done before by somebody <lb n="11637"/>
             in history, by some great person whose head was in the books <lb n="11638"/>
             of history. And the rector would declare that he had been <lb n="11639"/>
             wrongly punished because the senate and the Roman people <lb n="11640"/>
             always declared that the man who did that had been wrongly <lb n="11641"/>
             punished. Those were the great men whose names were in <lb n="11642"/>
             Richmal Magnall's Questions. History was all about those men <lb n="11643"/>
             and what they did and that was what Peter Parley's Tales about <lb n="11644"/>
             Greece and Rome were all about. Peter Parley himself was on <lb n="11645"/>
             the first page in a picture. There was a road over a heath with <lb n="11646"/>
             grass at the side and little bushes: and Peter Parley had a broad <lb n="11647"/>
             hat like a protestant minister and a big stick and he was walk- <lb n="11648"/>
             ing fast along the road to <place><location><geo>39.074208 21.824312</geo></location><placeName>Greece</placeName></place> and <lb n="11649"/>
            <place><location><geo>41.902783 12.496366</geo></location><placeName>Rome</placeName></place>.</p>
            <p>  It was easy what he had to do. All he had to do  was when <lb n="11650"/>
             the dinner was over and he came out in his turn to go on <lb n="11651"/>
             walking but not out to the corridor but up the staircase on the <lb n="11652"/>
             right that led to the castle. He had nothing to do but that: to <lb n="11653"/>
             turn to the right and walk fast up the staircase and in half a <lb n="11654"/>
             minute he would be in the low dark narrow corridor that led <lb n="11655"/>
             through the castle to the rector's room. And every fellow had <lb n="11656"/>
             said that it was unfair, even the fellow out of second of gram- <lb n="11657"/>
             mar who had said that about the senate and the Roman people.<lb n="11658"/> </p>
            <p>  What would happen? He heard the fellows of the higher line <lb n="11659"/>
             stand up at the top of the refectory and heard their steps as <lb n="11660"/>
             they came down the matting: Paddy Rath and Jimmy Magee <lb n="11661"/>
             and the Spaniard and the Portuguese and the fifth was big <lb n="11662"/>
             Corrigan who was going to be flogged by Mr Gleeson. That <lb n="11663"/>
             was why the prefect of studies had called him a schemer and <lb n="11664"/>
             pandied him for nothing: and, straining his weak eyes, tired <lb n="11665"/>
             with the tears, he watched big Corrigan's broad shoulders and <lb n="11666"/>
             big hanging black head passing in the file. But he had done <lb n="11667"/>
             something and besides Mr Gleeson would not flog him hard: <lb n="11668"/>
             and he remembered how big Corrigan looked in the bath. He <lb n="11669"/>
             had skin the same colour as the <seg type="neologism">turfcoloured</seg> bogwater in the <lb n="11670"/>
             shallow end of the bath and when he walked along the side his <lb n="11671"/>
             feet slapped loudly on the wet tiles and at every step his thighs <lb n="11672"/>
             shook a little because he was fat.<lb n="11673"/> </p>
            <p>  The refectory was half empty and the fellows were still <lb n="11674"/>
             passing out in file. He could go up the staircase because there <lb n="11675"/>
             was never a priest or a prefect outside the refectory door. But <lb n="11676"/>
             he could not go. The rector would side with the prefect of <lb n="11677"/>
             studies and think it was a schoolboy trick and then the prefect <lb n="11678"/>
             of studies would come in every day the same only it would be <lb n="11679"/>
             worse because he would be dreadfully waxy at any fellow <lb n="11680"/>
             going up to the rector about him. The fellows had told him to <lb n="11681"/>
             go but they would not go themselves. They had forgotten all <lb n="11682"/>
             about it. No, it was best to forget all about it: and perhaps the <lb n="11683"/>
             prefect of studies had only said he would come in. No, it was <lb n="11684"/>
             best to hide out of the way because when you were small and <lb n="11685"/>
             young you could often escape that way.<lb n="11686"/> </p>
            <p>  The fellows at his table stood up. He stood up and passed <lb n="11687"/>
             out among them in the file. He had to decide. He was coming <lb n="11688"/>
             near the door. If he went on with the fellows he could never go <lb n="11689"/>
             up to the rector because he could not leave the playground for <lb n="11690"/>
             that. And if he went and was pandied all the same all the <lb n="11691"/>
             fellows would make fun and talk about young Dedalus going <lb n="11692"/>
             up to the rector to tell on the prefect of studies.<lb n="11693"/> </p>
            <p>  He was walking down along the matting and he saw the <lb n="11694"/>
             door before him. It was impossible: he could not. He thought <lb n="11695"/>
             of the baldy head of the prefect of studies with the cruel no- <lb n="11696"/>
             <seg type="neologism">nocoloured</seg> eyes looking at him and he heard the voice of the <lb n="11697"/>
             prefect of studies asking him twice what his name was. Why <lb n="11698"/>
             could he not remember the name when he was told the first <lb n="11699"/>
             time? Was he not listening the first time or was it to make fun <lb n="11700"/>
             out of the name? The great men in the history had names like <lb n="11701"/>
             that and nobody made fun of them. It was his own name that <lb n="11702"/>
             he should have made fun of if he wanted to make fun. Dolan: it <lb n="11703"/>
             was like the name of a woman that washed clothes.<lb n="11704"/> </p>
            <p>  He had reached the door and, turning quickly  to the right, <lb n="11705"/>
             walked up the stairs: and, before he could make up his mind to <lb n="11706"/>
             come back, he had entered the low dark narrow corridor that <lb n="11707"/>
             led to the castle. And as he crossed the threshold of the door of <lb n="11708"/>
             the corridor  he saw, without turning his head to look, that all <lb n="11709"/>
             the fellows were looking after him as they went filing by.<lb n="11710"/> </p>
            <p>  He passed along the narrow dark corridor, passing little <lb n="11711"/>
             doors that were the doors of the rooms of the community. He <lb n="11712"/>
             peered in front of him and right and left through the gloom and <lb n="11713"/>
             thought that those must be portraits. It was dark and silent and <lb n="11714"/>
             his eyes were weak and tired with tears so that he could not <lb n="11715"/>
             see. But he thought they were the portraits of the saints and <lb n="11716"/>
             great men of the order who were looking down on him silently <lb n="11717"/>
             as he passed: saint Ignatius Loyola holding an open book and <lb n="11718"/>
             pointing to the words <seg xml:lang="la">Ad Majorem Dei Gloriam</seg> in it, saint <lb n="11719"/>
             Francis Xavier pointing to his chest, Lorenzo Ricci with his <lb n="11720"/>
             berretta on his head like one of the prefects of the lines, the <lb n="11721"/>
             three patrons of holy youth, saint Stanislaus Kostka, saint <lb n="11722"/>
             Aloysius Gonzaga and blessed John Berchmans, all with young <lb n="11723"/>
             faces because they died when they were young, and Father <lb n="11724"/>
             Peter Kenny sitting in a chair wrapped in a big cloak.<lb n="11725"/> </p>
            <p>  He came out on the landing above the entrance hall and <lb n="11726"/>
             looked about him. That was where Hamilton Rowan had <lb n="11727"/>
             passed and the marks of the soldiers' slugs were there. And it <lb n="11728"/>
             was there that the old servants had seen the ghost in the white <lb n="11729"/>
             cloak of a marshal.<lb n="11730"/> </p>
            <p>  An old servant was sweeping at the end of the landing. He <lb n="11731"/>
             asked him where was the rector's room and the old servant <lb n="11732"/>
             pointed to the door at the far end and looked after him as he <lb n="11733"/>
             went on to it and knocked.<lb n="11734"/> </p>
            <p>  There was no answer. He knocked again more loudly and <lb n="11735"/>
             his heart jumped when he heard a muffled voice say: <lb n="11736"/>
             <said who="the rector">―Come in! <lb n="11737"/></said> </p>
            <p>  He turned the handle and opened the door and fumbled for <lb n="11738"/>
             the handle of the green baize door inside. He found it and <lb n="11739"/>
             pushed it open and went in.<lb n="11740"/> </p>
            <p>  He saw the rector sitting at a desk writing. There was a skull <lb n="11741"/>
             on the desk and a strange solemn smell in the room like the old <lb n="11742"/>
             leather of chairs.<lb n="11743"/> </p>
            <p>  His heart was beating fast on account of the solemn place he <lb n="11744"/>
             was in and the silence of the room:  and he looked at the skull <lb n="11745"/>
             and at the rector's <seg type="neologism">kindlooking</seg> face. <lb n="11746"/>
             <said who="the rector">―Well, my little man, said the rector. What is it? <lb n="11747"/></said> </p>
            <p>  Stephen swallowed down the thing in his throat and said: <lb n="11748"/>
             <said who="Stephen">―I broke my glasses, sir. <lb n="11749"/></said> </p>
            <p>  The rector opened his mouth and said: <lb n="11750"/>
             <said who="the rector">―O! <lb n="11751"/></said> </p>
            <p>  Then he smiled and said: <lb n="11752"/>
             <said who="the rector">―Well, if we broke our glasses we must write home for a new <lb n="11753"/>
             pair. <lb n="11754"/> </said>
             <said who="Stephen">―I wrote home, sir, said Stephen, and Father Arnall said I am <lb n="11755"/>
             not to study till they come. <lb n="11756"/> </said>
             <said who="the rector">―Quite right! said the rector. <lb n="11757"/></said> </p>
            <p>  Stephen swallowed down the thing again  and tried to keep <lb n="11758"/>
             his legs and his voice from shaking. <lb n="11759"/>
             <said who="Stephen">―But, sir .... <lb n="11760"/> </said>
             <said who="the rector">―Yes? <lb n="11761"/> </said>
             <said who="Stephen">―Father Dolan came in today and pandied me because I was <lb n="11762"/>
             not writing my theme. <lb n="11763"/></said> </p>
            <p>  The rector looked at him in silence and he could feel the <lb n="11764"/>
             blood rising to his face and the tears about to rise to his eyes.<lb n="11765"/> </p>
            <p>  The rector said: <lb n="11766"/>
             <said who="the rector">―Your name is Dedalus, isn't it? <lb n="11767"/> </said>
             <said who="Stephen">―Yes, sir. <lb n="11768"/> </said>
             <said who="the rector">―And where did you break your glasses? <lb n="11769"/> </said>
             <said who="Stephen">―On the <seg type="neologism">cinderpath</seg>, sir. A fellow was coming out of the <lb n="11770"/>
             bicycle house and I fell and they got broken. I don't know the <lb n="11771"/>
             fellow's name. <lb n="11772"/></said> </p>
            <p>  The rector looked at him again in silence. Then he smiled <lb n="11773"/>
             and said: <lb n="11774"/>
             <said who="the rector">―O, well, it was a mistake. I am sure Father Dolan did not <lb n="11775"/>
             know. <lb n="11776"/> </said>
             <said who="Stephen">―But I told him I broke them, sir, and he pandied me. <lb n="11777"/> </said>
             <said who="the rector">―Did you tell him that you had written home for a new pair? <lb n="11778"/>
             the rector asked. <lb n="11779"/> </said>
             <said who="Stephen">―No, sir. <lb n="11780"/> </said>
             <said who="the rector">―O well then, said the rector, Father Dolan did not under- <lb n="11781"/>
             stand. You can say that I excuse you from your lessons for a <lb n="11782"/>
             few days. <lb n="11783"/></said> </p>
            <p>  Stephen said quickly for fear his trembling would prevent <lb n="11784"/>
             him: <lb n="11785"/>
             <said who="Stephen">―Yes, sir, but Father Dolan said he will come in tomorrow to <lb n="11786"/>
             pandy me again for it. <lb n="11787"/> </said>
             <said who="the rector">―Very well, the rector said. It is a mistake and I shall speak to <lb n="11788"/>
             Father Dolan myself. Will that do now? <lb n="11789"/></said> </p>
            <p>  Stephen felt the tears wetting his eyes and murmured: <lb n="11790"/>
             <said who="Stephen">―O yes, sir, thanks. <lb n="11791"/></said> </p>
            <p>  The rector held his hand across the side of the desk where <lb n="11792"/>
             the skull was and Stephen, placing his hand in it for a moment, <lb n="11793"/>
             felt a cool moist palm. <lb n="11794"/>
             <said who="the rector">―Good day now, said the rector, withdrawing his hand and <lb n="11795"/>
             bowing. <lb n="11796"/> </said>
             <said who="Stephen">―Good day, sir, said Stephen. <lb n="11797"/></said> </p>
            <p>  He bowed and walked quietly out of the room, closing the <lb n="11798"/>
             doors carefully and slowly.<lb n="11799"/> </p>
            <p>  But when he had passed the old servant on the landing and <lb n="11800"/>
             was again in the low narrow dark corridor he began to walk <lb n="11801"/>
             faster and faster. Faster and faster he hurried on through the <lb n="11802"/>
             gloom, excitedly. He bumped his elbow against the door at the <lb n="11803"/>
             end and, hurrying down the staircase, walked quickly through <lb n="11804"/>
             the two corridors and out into the air.<lb n="11805"/> </p>
            <p>  He could hear the cries of the fellows on the playgrounds. <lb n="11806"/>
             He broke into a run and, running quicker and quicker, ran <lb n="11807"/>
             across the <seg type="neologism">cinderpath</seg> and reached the third line playground, <lb n="11808"/>
             panting.<lb n="11809"/> </p>
            <p>  The fellows had seen him running. They closed round him in <lb n="11810"/>
             a ring, pushing one against another to hear. <lb n="11811"/>
             <said who="the fellows">―Tell us! Tell us! <lb n="11812"/> </said>
             <said who="the fellows">―What did he say? <lb n="11813"/> </said>
             <said who="the fellows">―Did you go in? <lb n="11814"/> </said>
             <said who="the fellows">―What did he say? <lb n="11815"/> </said>
             <said who="the fellows">―Tell us! Tell us! <lb n="11816"/></said> </p>
            <p>  He told them what he had said and what the rector had said <lb n="11817"/>
             and, when he had told them, all the fellows flung their caps <lb n="11818"/>
             spinning up into the air and cried: <lb n="11819"/>
             <said who="the fellows">―Hurroo! <lb n="11820"/></said> </p>
            <p>  They caught their caps and sent them up again spinning <lb n="11821"/>
             <seg type="neologism">skyhigh</seg> and cried again: <lb n="11822"/>
             <said who="the fellows">―Hurroo! Hurroo! <lb n="11823"/></said> </p>
            <p>  They made a cradle of their locked hands and hoisted him <lb n="11824"/>
             up among them and carried him along till he struggled to get <lb n="11825"/>
             free. And when he had escaped from them they broke away in <lb n="11826"/>
             all directions, flinging their caps again into the air and whis- <lb n="11827"/>
             tling as they went spinning up and crying: <lb n="11828"/>
             <said who="the fellows">―Hurroo! <lb n="11829"/></said> </p>
            <p>  And they gave three groans for Baldyhead Dolan and three <lb n="11830"/>
             cheers for Conmee and they said he was the decentest rector <lb n="11831"/>
             that was ever in Clongowes.<lb n="11832"/> </p>
            <p>  The cheers died away in the soft grey air. He was alone. He <lb n="11833"/>
             was happy and free: but he would not be anyway proud with <lb n="11834"/>
             Father Dolan. He would be very quiet and obedient: and he <lb n="11835"/>
             wished that he could do something kind for him to show him <lb n="11836"/>
             that he was not proud.<lb n="11837"/> </p>
            <p>  The air was soft and grey and mild and evening was coming. <lb n="11838"/>
             There was the smell of evening in the air, the smell of the fields <lb n="11839"/>
             in the country where they digged up turnips to peel them and <lb n="11840"/>
             eat them when they went out for a walk to <place><location><geo>53.257926 -6.585225</geo></location><placeName>Major Barton's</placeName></place>, the <lb n="11841"/>
             smell there was in the little wood beyond the pavilion where <lb n="11842"/>
             the gallnuts were.<lb n="11843"/> </p>
            <p>  The fellows were practising long shies and bowling lobs and <lb n="11844"/>
             slow twisters. In the soft grey silence he could hear the bump of <lb n="11845"/>
             the balls: and from here and from there through the quiet air <lb n="11846"/>
             the sound of the cricket bats: pick, pack, pock, puck: like drops <lb n="11847"/>
             of water in a fountain falling softly in the brimming bowl.<lb n="11848"/> </p>

          <p>  Uncle Charles smoked such black twist that at last his out- <lb n="20001"/>
          spoken nephew suggested to him to enjoy his morning smoke <lb n="20002"/>
          in a little outhouse at the end of the garden. <lb n="20003"/>
           <said who="Uncle Charles">―Very good, Simon. All serene, Simon, said the old man tran- <lb n="20004"/>
          quilly. Anywhere you like. The outhouse will do me nicely: it <lb n="20005"/>
          will be more salubrious.<lb n="20006"/> </said>
           <said who="Simon Dedalus">―Damn me, said Mr Dedalus frankly, if I know how you can <lb n="20007"/>
          smoke such villainous awful tobacco. It's like gunpowder, by <lb n="20008"/>
          God.<lb n="20009"/> </said>
           <said who="Uncle Charles">―It's very nice, Simon, replied the old man. Very cool and <lb n="20010"/>
          mollifying.<lb n="20011"/></said> </p>
          <p>  Every morning, therefore, uncle Charles repaired to his out- <lb n="20012"/>
          house but not before he had creased and brushed scrupulously <lb n="20013"/>
          his back hair and brushed and put on his tall hat. While he <lb n="20014"/>
          smoked the brim of his tall hat and the bowl of his pipe were <lb n="20015"/>
          just visible beyond the jambs of the outhouse door. His arbour, <lb n="20016"/>
          as he called the reeking outhouse which he shared with the cat <lb n="20017"/>
          and the garden tools, served him also as a soundingbox: and <lb n="20018"/>
          every morning he hummed contentedly one of his favourite <lb n="20019"/>
          songs: <emph>O, twine me a bower</emph> or <emph>Blue eyes and golden hair</emph> or <lb n="20020"/>
          <emph>The Groves of Blarney</emph> while the grey and blue coils of smoke <lb n="20021"/>
          rose slowly from his pipe and vanished in the pure air.<lb n="20022"/> </p>
          <p>  During the first part of the summer in Blackrock uncle <lb n="20023"/>
          Charles was Stephen's constant companion. Uncle Charles was <lb n="20024"/>
          a hale old man with a well tanned skin, rugged features and <lb n="20025"/>
          white side whiskers. On week days he did messages between <lb n="20026"/>
          the house in <place><location><geo>53.293248, -6.180109</geo></location><placeName>Carysfort Avenue</placeName></place> and those shops in the main <lb n="20027"/>
          street of the town with which the family dealt. Stephen was <lb n="20028"/>
          glad to go with him on these errands for uncle Charles helped <lb n="20029"/>
          him very liberally to handfuls of whatever was exposed in open <lb n="20030"/>
          boxes and barrels outside the counter. He would seize a hand- <lb n="20031"/>
          ful of grapes and sawdust or three or four American apples and <lb n="20032"/>
          thrust them generously into his grandnephew's hand while the <lb n="20033"/>
          shopman smiled uneasily; and on Stephen's feigning reluctance <lb n="20034"/>
          to take them, he would frown and say: <lb n="20035"/>
           <said who="Uncle Charles">―Take them, sir. Do you hear me, sir? They're good for your <lb n="20036"/>
          bowels.<lb n="20037"/></said> </p>
          <p>  When the order list had been booked the two would go on <lb n="20038"/>
          to the park where an old friend of Stephen's father, Mike <lb n="20039"/>
          Flynn, would be found seated on a bench, waiting for them. <lb n="20040"/>
          Then would begin Stephen's run round the park. Mike Flynn <lb n="20041"/>
          would stand at the gate near the railway station, watch in <lb n="20042"/>
          hand, while Stephen ran round the track in the style Mike <lb n="20043"/>
          Flynn favoured, his head high lifted, his knees well lifted and <lb n="20044"/>
          his hands held straight down by his sides. When the morning <lb n="20045"/>
          practice was over the trainer would make his comments and <lb n="20046"/>
          sometimes illustrate them by shuffling along for a yard or so <lb n="20047"/>
          comically in an old pair of blue canvas shoes. A small ring of <lb n="20048"/>
          wonderstruck children and nursemaids would gather to watch <lb n="20049"/>
          him and linger even when he and uncle Charles had sat down <lb n="20050"/>
          again and were talking athletics and politics. Though he had <lb n="20051"/>
          heard his father say that Mike Flynn had put some of the best <lb n="20052"/>
          runners of modern times through his hands Stephen often <lb n="20053"/>
          glanced with mistrust at his trainer's flabby stubblecovered <lb n="20054"/>
          face, as it bent over the long stained fingers through which he <lb n="20055"/>
          rolled his cigarette, and with pity at the mild lustreless blue <lb n="20056"/>
          eyes which would look up suddenly from the task and gaze <lb n="20057"/>
          vaguely into the bluer distance while the long swollen fingers <lb n="20058"/>
          ceased their rolling and grains and fibres of tobacco fell back <lb n="20059"/>
          into the pouch.<lb n="20060"/> </p>
          <p>  On the way home uncle Charles would often pay a visit to <lb n="20061"/>
          the chapel and, as the font was above Stephen's reach, the old <lb n="20062"/>
          man would dip his hand and then sprinkle the water briskly <lb n="20063"/>
          about Stephen's clothes and on the floor of the porch. While he <lb n="20064"/>
          prayed he knelt on his red handkerchief and read above his <lb n="20065"/>
          breath from a thumbblackened prayerbook wherein catch- <lb n="20066"/>
          words were printed at the foot of every page. Stephen knelt at <lb n="20067"/>
          his side respecting, though he did not share, his piety. He often <lb n="20068"/>
          wondered what his granduncle prayed for so seriously. Perhaps <lb n="20069"/>
          he prayed for the souls in purgatory or for the grace of a happy <lb n="20070"/>
          death: or perhaps he prayed that God might send him back a <lb n="20071"/>
          part of the big fortune he had squandered in Cork.<lb n="20072"/> </p>
          <p>  On Sundays Stephen with his father and his granduncle took <lb n="20073"/>
          their constitutional. The old man was a nimble walker in spite <lb n="20074"/>
          of his corns and often ten or twelve miles of the road were <lb n="20075"/>
          covered. The little village of <place><location><geo>53.287857, -6.203573</geo></location><placeName>Stillorgan</placeName></place> was the parting of the <lb n="20076"/>
          ways. Either they went to the left towards the Dublin moun- <lb n="20077"/>
          tains or along the <place><location><geo>53.297702, -6.233964</geo></location><placeName>Goatstown road</placeName></place> and thence <lb n="20078"/>
          into <place><location><geo>53.289154, -6.243264</geo></location><placeName>Dundrum</placeName></place>,
          coming home by  <place><location><geo>53.269979, -6.224923</geo></location><placeName>Sandyford</placeName></place>. Trudging along the road or <lb n="20079"/>
          standing in some grimy wayside publichouse his elders spoke <lb n="20080"/>
          constantly of the subjects nearest their hearts, of Irish politics, <lb n="20081"/>
          of Munster and of the legends of their own family, to all of <lb n="20082"/>
          which Stephen lent an avid ear. Words which he did not under- <lb n="20083"/>
          stand he said over and over to himself till he had learned them <lb n="20084"/>
          by heart: and through them he had glimpses of the real world <lb n="20085"/>
          about him. The hour when he too would take his part in the <lb n="20086"/>
          life of that world seemed drawing near and in secret he began <lb n="20087"/>
          to make ready for the great part which he felt awaited him the <lb n="20088"/>
          nature of which he only dimly apprehended.<lb n="20089"/> </p>
          <p>  His evenings were his own; and he pored over a ragged <lb n="20090"/>
          translation of <emph>The Count of Monte Cristo</emph>. The figure of that <lb n="20091"/>
          dark avenger stood forth in his mind for whatever he had heard <lb n="20092"/>
          or divined in childhood of the strange and terrible. At night he <lb n="20093"/>
          built up on the parlour table an image of the wonderful island <lb n="20094"/>
          cave out of transfers and paper flowers and coloured tissue <lb n="20095"/>
          paper and strips of the silver and golden paper in which choc- <lb n="20096"/>
          olate is wrapped. When he had broken up this scenery, weary <lb n="20097"/>
          of its tinsel, there would come to his mind the bright picture of <lb n="20098"/>
           <place><location><geo>43.295207, <lb n="20099"/>
          5.364077</geo></location><placeName>Marseilles</placeName></place>, of sunny trellisses and of Mercedes. Outside <place><location><geo>53.300907,
          -6.177049</geo></location><placeName>Black-
           rock</placeName></place>, on the road that led to the mountains, stood a small <lb n="20100"/>
          whitewashed house in the garden of which grew many rose- <lb n="20101"/>
          bushes: and in this house, he told himself, another Mercedes <lb n="20102"/>
          lived. Both on the outward and on the homeward journey he <lb n="20103"/>
          measured distance by this landmark: and in his imagination he <lb n="20104"/>
          lived through a long train of adventures, marvellous as those in <lb n="20105"/>
          the book itself, towards the close of which there appeared an <lb n="20106"/>
          image of himself, grown older and sadder, standing in a <lb n="20107"/>
          moonlit garden with Mercedes who had so many years before <lb n="20108"/>
          slighted his love, and with a sadly proud gesture of refusal, <lb n="20109"/>
          saying: <lb n="20110"/>
           <said who="Count of Monte Cristo">―Madam, I never eat muscatel grapes.<lb n="20111"/></said> </p>
          <p>  He became the ally of a boy named Aubrey Mills and <lb n="20112"/>
          founded with him a gang of adventurers in the avenue. Aubrey <lb n="20113"/>
          carried a whistle dangling from his buttonhole and a bicycle <lb n="20114"/>
          lamp attached to his belt while the others had short sticks <lb n="20115"/>
          thrust daggerwise through theirs. Stephen, who had read of <lb n="20116"/>
          Napoleon's plain style of dress, chose to remain unadorned and <lb n="20117"/>
          thereby heightened for himself the pleasure of taking counsel <lb n="20118"/>
          with his lieutenant before giving orders. The gang made forays <lb n="20119"/>
          into the gardens of old maids or went down to the castle and <lb n="20120"/>
          fought a battle on the shaggy weedgrown rocks, coming home <lb n="20121"/>
          after it weary stragglers with the stale odours of the foreshore <lb n="20122"/>
          in their nostrils and the rank oils of the seawrack upon their <lb n="20123"/>
          hands and in their hair.<lb n="20124"/> </p>
          <p>  Aubrey and Stephen had a common milkman and often they <lb n="20125"/>
          drove out in the milkcar to <place><location><geo>53.250224, -6.179926</geo></location><placeName>Carrickmines</placeName></place> where the cows were <lb n="20126"/>
          at grass. While the men were milking the boys would take turns <lb n="20127"/>
          in riding the tractable mare round the field. But when autumn <lb n="20128"/>
          came the cows were driven home from the grass: and the first <lb n="20129"/>
          sight of the filthy cowyard at <place><location><geo>53.300791 -6.177067</geo></location><placeName>Stradbrook</placeName></place> with its foul green <lb n="20130"/>
          puddles and clots of liquid dung and steaming brantroughs <lb n="20131"/>
          sickened Stephen's heart. The cattle which had seemed so beau- <lb n="20132"/>
          tiful in the country on sunny days revolted him and he could <lb n="20133"/>
          not even look at the milk they yielded.<lb n="20134"/> </p>
          <p>  The coming of September did not trouble him this year for <lb n="20135"/>
          he knew he was not to be sent back to <place><location><geo>53.310770, -6.684719</geo></location><placeName>Clongowes</placeName></place>. The practice <lb n="20136"/>
          in the park came to an end when Mike Flynn went into hospi- <lb n="20137"/>
          tal. Aubrey was at school and had only an hour or two free in <lb n="20138"/>
          the evening. The gang fell asunder and there were no more <lb n="20139"/>
          nightly forays or battles on the rocks. Stephen sometimes went <lb n="20140"/>
          round with the car which delivered the evening milk: and these <lb n="20141"/>
          chilly drives blew away his memory of the filth of the cowyard <lb n="20142"/>
          and he felt no repugnance at seeing the cowhairs and hayseeds <lb n="20143"/>
          on the milkman's coat. Whenever the car drew up before a <lb n="20144"/>
          house he waited to catch a glimpse of a well scrubbed kitchen <lb n="20145"/>
          or of a softly lighted hall and to see how the servant would <lb n="20146"/>
          hold the jug and how she would close the door. He thought it <lb n="20147"/>
          should be a pleasant life enough, driving along the roads every <lb n="20148"/>
          evening to deliver milk, if he had warm gloves and a fat bag of <lb n="20149"/>
          gingernuts in his pocket to eat from. But the same foreknowl- <lb n="20150"/>
          edge which had sickened his heart and made his limbs sag <lb n="20151"/>
          suddenly as he raced round the park, the same intuition which <lb n="20152"/>
          had made him glance with mistrust at his trainer's flabby <lb n="20153"/>
          stubblecovered face as it bent heavily over his long stained <lb n="20154"/>
          fingers, dissipated any vision of the future. In a vague way he <lb n="20155"/>
          understood that his father was in trouble and that this was the <lb n="20156"/>
          reason why he himself had not been sent back to <place><location><geo>53.310770, -6.684719</geo></location><placeName>Clongowes</placeName></place>. <lb n="20157"/>
          For some time he had felt the slight changes in his house; and <lb n="20158"/>
          these changes in what he had deemed unchangeable were so <lb n="20159"/>
          many slight shocks to his boyish conception of the world. The <lb n="20160"/>
          ambition which he felt astir at times in the darkness of his soul <lb n="20161"/>
          sought no outlet. A dusk like that of the outer world obscured <lb n="20162"/>
          his mind as he heard the mare's hoofs clattering along the <lb n="20163"/>
          tramtrack on the Rock Road and the great can swaying and <lb n="20164"/>
          rattling behind him.<lb n="20165"/> </p>
          <p>  He returned to Mercedes and, as he brooded upon her im- <lb n="20166"/>
          age, a strange unrest crept into his blood. Sometimes a fever <lb n="20167"/>
          gathered within him and led him to rove alone in the evening <lb n="20168"/>
          along the quiet avenues. The peace of the gardens and the <lb n="20169"/>
          kindly lights in the windows poured a tender influence into his <lb n="20170"/>
          restless heart. The noise of children at play annoyed him and <lb n="20171"/>
          their silly voices made him feel, even more keenly than he had <lb n="20172"/>
          felt at <place><location><geo>53.310770, -6.684719</geo></location><placeName>Clongowes</placeName></place>, that he was different from others. He did <lb n="20173"/>
          not want to play. He wanted to meet in the real world the <lb n="20174"/>
          unsubstantial image which his soul so constantly beheld. He <lb n="20175"/>
          did not know where to seek it or how: but a premonition which <lb n="20176"/>
          led him on told him that this image would, without any overt <lb n="20177"/>
          act of his, encounter him. They would meet quietly as if they <lb n="20178"/>
          had known each other and had made their tryst, perhaps at one <lb n="20179"/>
          of the gates or in some more secret place. They would be alone, <lb n="20180"/>
          surrounded by darkness and silence: and in that moment of <lb n="20181"/>
          supreme tenderness he would be transfigured. He would fade <lb n="20182"/>
          into something impalpable under her eyes and then, in a mo- <lb n="20183"/>
          ment, he would be transfigured. Weakness and timidity and <lb n="20184"/>
          inexperience would fall from him in that magic moment.<lb n="20185"/> </p>

          <p>   Two great yellow caravans had halted one morning before <lb n="20186"/>
          the door and men had come tramping into the house to dis- <lb n="20187"/>
          mantle it. The furniture had been hustled out through the front <lb n="20188"/>
          garden which was strewn with wisps of straw and rope ends <lb n="20189"/>
          and into the huge vans at the gate. When all had been safely <lb n="20190"/>
          stowed the vans had set off noisily down the avenue: and from <lb n="20191"/>
          the window of the railway carriage, in which he had sat with <lb n="20192"/>
          his redeyed mother, Stephen had seen them lumbering heavily <lb n="20193"/>
          along the Merrion Road.<lb n="20194"/> </p>
          <p>  The parlour fire would not draw that evening and Mr Deda- <lb n="20195"/>
          lus rested the poker against the bars of the grate to attract the <lb n="20196"/>
          flame. Uncle Charles dozed in a corner of the half furnished <lb n="20197"/>
          uncarpeted room and near him the family portraits leaned <lb n="20198"/>
          against the wall. The lamp on the table shed a weak light over <lb n="20199"/>
          the boarded floor, muddied by the feet of the vanmen. Stephen <lb n="20200"/>
          sat on a footstool beside his father listening to a long and <lb n="20201"/>
          incoherent monologue. He understood little or nothing of it at <lb n="20202"/>
          first but he became slowly aware that his father had enemies <lb n="20203"/>
          and that some fight was going to take place. He felt, too, that <lb n="20204"/>
          he was being enlisted for the fight, that some duty was being <lb n="20205"/>
          laid upon his shoulders. The sudden flight from the comfort <lb n="20206"/>
          and revery of <place><location><geo>53.300907, -6.177049</geo></location><placeName>Blackrock</placeName></place>, the passage through the gloomy foggy <lb n="20207"/>
          city, the thought of the bare cheerless house in which they were <lb n="20208"/>
          now to live made his heart heavy: and again an intuition or <lb n="20209"/>
          foreknowledge of the future came to him. He understood also <lb n="20210"/>
          why the servants had often whispered together in the hall and <lb n="20211"/>
          why his father had often stood on the hearthrug, with his back <lb n="20212"/>
          to the fire, talking loudly to uncle Charles who urged him to sit <lb n="20213"/>
          down and eat his dinner. <lb n="20214"/>
           <said who="Simon Dedalus">―There's a crack of the whip left in me yet, Stephen, old chap, <lb n="20215"/>
          said Mr Dedalus, poking at the dull fire with fierce energy. <lb n="20216"/>
          We're not dead yet, sonny. No, by the Lord Jesus (God forgive <lb n="20217"/>
          me) nor half dead. <lb n="20218"/></said> </p>
          <p>  <place><location><geo>53.349307, -6.263654</geo></location><placeName>Dublin</placeName></place> was a new and complex sensation. Uncle Charles <lb n="20219"/>
          had grown so witless that he could no longer be sent out on <lb n="20220"/>
          errands and the disorder in settling in the new house left Ste- <lb n="20221"/>
          phen freer than he had been in <place><location><geo>53.300907, -6.177049</geo></location><placeName>Blackrock</placeName></place>. In the beginning he <lb n="20222"/>
          contented himself with circling timidly round the neighbouring <lb n="20223"/>
          square or, at most, going half way down one of the side streets: <lb n="20224"/>
          but when he had made a skeleton map of the city in his mind he <lb n="20225"/>
          followed boldly one of its central lines until he reached the <lb n="20226"/>
          customhouse. He passed unchallenged among the docks and <lb n="20227"/>
          along the quays wondering at the multitude of corks that lay <lb n="20228"/>
          bobbing on the surface of the water in a thick yellow scum, at <lb n="20229"/>
          the crowds of quay porters and the rumbling carts and the <lb n="20230"/>
          illdressed bearded policeman. The vastness and strangeness of <lb n="20231"/>
          the life suggested to him by the bales of merchandise stacked <lb n="20232"/>
          along the walls or swung aloft out of the holds of steamers <lb n="20233"/>
          wakened again in him the unrest which had sent him wan- <lb n="20234"/>
          dering in the evening from garden to garden in search of <lb n="20235"/>
          Mercedes. And amid this new bustling life he might have <lb n="20236"/>
          fancied himself in another <place><location><geo>43.295207, 5.364077</geo></location><placeName>Marseilles</placeName></place> but that he missed the <lb n="20237"/>
          bright sky and the sunwarmed trellisses of the wineshops. A <lb n="20238"/>
          vague dissatisfaction grew up within him as he looked on the <lb n="20239"/>
          quays and on the river and on the lowering skies and yet he <lb n="20240"/>
          continued to wander up and down day after day as if he really <lb n="20241"/>
          sought someone that eluded him.<lb n="20242"/> </p>
          <p>  He went once or twice with his mother to visit their rela- <lb n="20243"/>
          tives: and, though they passed a jovial array of shops lit up and <lb n="20244"/>
          adorned for Christmas, his mood of embittered silence did not <lb n="20245"/>
          leave him. The causes of his embitterment were many, remote <lb n="20246"/>
          and near. He was angry with himself for being young and the <lb n="20247"/>
          prey of restless foolish impulses, angry also with the change of <lb n="20248"/>
          fortune which was reshaping the world about him into a vision <lb n="20249"/>
          of squalor and insincerity. Yet his anger lent nothing to the <lb n="20250"/>
          vision. He chronicled with patience what he saw, detaching <lb n="20251"/>
          himself from it and tasting its mortifying flavour in secret.<lb n="20252"/> </p>
          <p>  He was sitting on the backless chair in his aunt's kitchen. A <lb n="20253"/>
          lamp with a reflector hung on the japanned wall of the fire- <lb n="20254"/>
          place and by its light his aunt was reading the evening paper <lb n="20255"/>
          that lay on her knees. She looked a long time at a smiling <lb n="20256"/>
          picture that was set in it and said musingly:<lb n="20257"/> </p>
           <said who="his aunt">―The beautiful Mabel Hunter!<lb n="20258"/> </said>
          <p>  A ringletted girl stood on tiptoe to peer at the picture and <lb n="20259"/>
          said softly: <lb n="20260"/>
           <said who="ringletted girl">―What is she in, mud? <lb n="20261"/> </said>
           <said who="ringletted girl's mother">―In the pantomime, love. <lb n="20262"/></said> </p>
          <p>  The child leaned her ringletted head against her mother's <lb n="20263"/>
          sleeve, gazing on the picture and murmured, as if fascinated: <lb n="20264"/>
           <said who="ringletted girl">―The beautiful Mabel Hunter! <lb n="20265"/></said> </p>
          <p>  As if fascinated, her eyes rested long upon those demurely <lb n="20266"/>
          taunting eyes and she murmured again devotedly: <lb n="20267"/>
           <said who="ringletted girl">―Isn't she an exquisite creature? <lb n="20268"/></said> </p>
          <p>  And the boy who came in from the street, stamping crook- <lb n="20269"/>
          edly under his stone of coal, heard her words. He dropped his <lb n="20270"/>
          load promptly on the floor and hurried to her side to see. But <lb n="20271"/>
          she did not raise her easeful head to let him see. He mauled the <lb n="20272"/>
          edges of the paper with his reddened and blackened hands, <lb n="20273"/>
          shouldering her aside and complaining that he could not see.<lb n="20274"/> </p>
          <p>  He was sitting in the narrow breakfast room high up in the <lb n="20275"/>
          old darkwindowed house. The firelight flickered on the wall <lb n="20276"/>
          and beyond the window a spectral dusk was gathering upon the <lb n="20277"/>
          river. Before the fire an old woman was busy making tea and, <lb n="20278"/>
          as she bustled at her task, she told in a low voice of what the <lb n="20279"/>
          priest and the doctor had said. She told too of certain changes <lb n="20280"/>
          that she had seen in her of late and of her odd ways and <lb n="20281"/>
          sayings. He sat listening to the words and following the ways <lb n="20282"/>
          of adventure that lay open in the coals, arches and vaults and <lb n="20283"/>
          winding galleries and jagged caverns.<lb n="20284"/> </p>
          <p>  Suddenly he became aware of something in the doorway. A <lb n="20285"/>
          skull appeared suspended in the gloom of the doorway. A <lb n="20286"/>
          feeble creature like a monkey was there, drawn thither by the <lb n="20287"/>
          sound of voices at the fire. A whining voice came from the <lb n="20288"/>
          door, asking: <lb n="20289"/>
           <said who="Ellen">―Is that Josephine? <lb n="20290"/></said> </p>
          <p>  The old bustling woman answered cheerily from the fire- <lb n="20291"/>
          place: <lb n="20292"/>
           <said who="old woman">―No, Ellen. It's Stephen. <lb n="20293"/> </said>
           <said who="Ellen">―O .... O, good evening, Stephen. <lb n="20294"/></said> </p>
          <p>  He answered the greeting and saw a silly smile break out <lb n="20295"/>
          over the face in the doorway. <lb n="20296"/>
           <said who="old woman">―Do you want anything, Ellen? asked the old woman at the <lb n="20297"/>
          fire.<lb n="20298"/></said> </p>
          <p>  But she did not answer the question and said: <lb n="20299"/>
           <said who="Ellen">―I thought it was Josephine. I thought you were Josephine, <lb n="20300"/>
          Stephen.<lb n="20301"/></said> </p>
          <p>  And, repeating this several times, she fell to laughing feebly.<lb n="20302"/> </p>
          <p>  He was sitting in the midst of a children's party at <place><location><geo>53.324608, <lb n="20303"/>
          -6.281580</geo></location><placeName>Harold's
           Cross</placeName></place>. His silent watchful manner had grown upon him and he <lb n="20304"/>
          took little part in the games. The children, wearing the spoils of <lb n="20305"/>
          their crackers, danced and romped noisily and, though he tried <lb n="20306"/>
          to share their merriment, he felt himself a gloomy figure amid <lb n="20307"/>
          the gay cocked hats and sunbonnets.<lb n="20308"/> </p>
          <p>  But when he had sung his song and withdrawn into a snug <lb n="20309"/>
          corner of the room he began to taste the joy of his loneliness. <lb n="20310"/>
          The mirth, which in the beginning of the evening had seemed <lb n="20311"/>
          to him false and trivial, was like a soothing air to him, passing <lb n="20312"/>
          gaily by his senses, hiding from other eyes the feverish agitation <lb n="20313"/>
          of his blood while through the circling of the dancers and amid <lb n="20314"/>
          the music and laughter her glances travelled to his corner, <lb n="20315"/>
          flattering, taunting, searching, exciting his heart.<lb n="20316"/> </p>
          <p>  In the hall the children who had stayed latest were putting <lb n="20317"/>
          on their things: the party was over. She had thrown a shawl <lb n="20318"/>
          about her and, as they went together towards the tram, sprays <lb n="20319"/>
          of her fresh warm breath flew gaily above her cowled head and <lb n="20320"/>
          her shoes tapped blithely on the glassy road.<lb n="20321"/> </p>
          <p>  It was the last tram. The lank brown horses knew it and <lb n="20322"/>
          shook their bells to the clear night in admonition. The conductor <lb n="20323"/>
          tor talked with the driver, both nodding often in the green light <lb n="20324"/>
          of the lamp. On the empty seats of the tram were scattered a <lb n="20325"/>
          few coloured tickets. No sound of footsteps came up or down <lb n="20326"/>
          the road. No sound broke the peace of the night save when the <lb n="20327"/>
          lank brown horses rubbed their noses together and shook their <lb n="20328"/>
          bells.<lb n="20329"/> </p>
          <p>  They seemed to listen, he on the upper step and she on the <lb n="20330"/>
          lower. She came up to his step many times and went down to <lb n="20331"/>
          hers again between their phrases and once or twice stood close <lb n="20332"/>
          beside him for some moments on the upper step, forgetting to <lb n="20333"/>
          go down, and then went down. His heart danced upon her <lb n="20334"/>
          movements like a cork upon a tide. He heard what her eyes <lb n="20335"/>
          said to him from beneath their cowl and knew that in some dim <lb n="20336"/>
          past, whether in life or in revery, he had heard their tale before. <lb n="20337"/>
          He saw her urge her vanities, her fine dress and sash and long <lb n="20338"/>
          black stockings, and knew that he had yielded to them a thou- <lb n="20339"/>
          sand times. Yet a voice within him spoke above the noise of his <lb n="20340"/>
          dancing heart, asking him would he take her gift to which he <lb n="20341"/>
          had only to stretch out his hand. And he remembered the day <lb n="20342"/>
          when he and Eileen had stood looking into the hotel grounds, <lb n="20343"/>
          watching the waiters running up a trail of bunting on the <lb n="20344"/>
          flagstaff and the foxterrier scampering to and fro on the sunny <lb n="20345"/>
          lawn, and how, all of a sudden, she had broken out into a peal <lb n="20346"/>
          of laughter and had run down the sloping curve of the path. <lb n="20347"/>
          Now, as then, he stood listlessly in his place, seemingly a <lb n="20348"/>
          tranquil watcher of the scene before him.<lb n="20349"/> </p>
          <p> ―She too wants me to catch hold of her, he thought. That's <lb n="20350"/>
          why she came with me to the tram. I could easily catch hold of <lb n="20351"/>
          her when she comes up to my step: nobody is looking. I could <lb n="20352"/>
          hold her and kiss her.<lb n="20353"/> </p>
          <p>  But he did neither: and, when he was sitting alone in the <lb n="20354"/>
          deserted tram, he tore his ticket into shreds and stared gloomily <lb n="20355"/>
          at the corrugated footboard.<lb n="20356"/> </p>
          <p>  The next day he sat at his table in the bare upper room for <lb n="20357"/>
          many hours. Before him lay a new pen, a new bottle of ink and <lb n="20358"/>
          a new emerald exercise. From force of habit he had written at <lb n="20359"/>
          the top of the first page the initial letters of the jesuit motto: <lb n="20360"/>
          A. M. D. G. On the first line of the page appeared the title of <lb n="20361"/>
          the verses he was trying to write: To E-- C--. He knew it was <lb n="20362"/>
          right to begin so for he had seen similar titles in the collected <lb n="20363"/>
          poems of Lord Byron. When he had written this title and <lb n="20364"/>
          drawn an ornamental line underneath he fell into a daydream <lb n="20365"/>
          and began to draw diagrams on the cover of the book. He saw <lb n="20366"/>
          himself sitting at his table in Bray the morning after the dis- <lb n="20367"/>
          cussion at the Christmas dinnertable, trying to write a poem <lb n="20368"/>
          about Parnell on the back of one of his father's second moiety <lb n="20369"/>
          notices. But his brain had then refused to grapple with the <lb n="20370"/>
          theme and, desisting, he had covered the page with the names <lb n="20371"/>
          and addresses of certain of his classmates: <lb n="20372"/>
           Roderick Kickham <lb n="20373"/>
          John Lawton <lb n="20374"/>
          Anthony MacSwiney <lb n="20375"/>
          Simon Moonan<lb n="20376"/> </p>
          <p>  Now it seemed as if he would fail again but, by dint of <lb n="20377"/>
          brooding on the incident, he thought himself into confidence. <lb n="20378"/>
          During this process all those elements which he deemed com- <lb n="20379"/>
          mon and insignificant fell out of the scene. There remained no <lb n="20380"/>
          trace of the tram itself nor of the trammen nor of the horses: <lb n="20381"/>
          nor did he and she appear vividly. The verses told only of the <lb n="20382"/>
          night and the balmy breeze and the maiden lustre of the moon. <lb n="20383"/>
          Some undefined sorrow was hidden in the hearts of the protag- <lb n="20384"/>
          onists as they stood in silence beneath the leafless trees and <lb n="20385"/>
          when the moment of farewell had come the kiss, which had <lb n="20386"/>
          been withheld by one, was given by both. After this the letters <lb n="20387"/>
          L. D. S. were written at the foot of the page and, having hidden <lb n="20388"/>
          the book, he went into his mother's bedroom and gazed at his <lb n="20389"/>
          face for a long time in the mirror of her dressingtable.<lb n="20390"/> </p>
          <p>  But his long spell of leisure and liberty was drawing to its <lb n="20391"/>
          end. One evening his father came home full of news which kept <lb n="20392"/>
          his tongue busy all through dinner. Stephen had been awaiting <lb n="20393"/>
          his father's return for there had been mutton hash that day and <lb n="20394"/>
          he knew that his father would make him dip his bread in the <lb n="20395"/>
          gravy. But he did not relish the hash for the mention of <lb n="20396"/>
           <place><location><geo>53.310770, -6.684719</geo></location><placeName>Clongowes</placeName></place> had coated his palate with a scum of disgust. <lb n="20397"/>
           <said who="Simon Dedalus">―I walked bang into him, said Mr Dedalus for the fourth <lb n="20398"/>
          time, just at the corner of the square.<lb n="20399"/> </said>
           <said who="Mary Dedalus">―Then I suppose, said Mrs Dedalus, he will be able to arrange <lb n="20400"/>
          it. I mean, about Belvedere.<lb n="20401"/> </said>
           <said who="Simon Dedalus">―Of course  he will, said Mr Dedalus. Don't I tell you he's <lb n="20402"/>
          provincial of the order now? <lb n="20403"/> </said>
           <said who="Mary Dedalus">―I never liked the idea of sending him to the christian brothers <lb n="20404"/>
          myself, said Mrs Dedalus. <lb n="20405"/> </said>
           <said who="Simon Dedalus">―Christian brothers be damned! said Mr Dedalus. Is it with <lb n="20406"/>
          Paddy Stink and Mickey Mud? No, let him stick to the jesuits <lb n="20407"/>
          in God's name since he began with them. They'll be of service <lb n="20408"/>
          to him in after years. Those are the fellows that can get you a <lb n="20409"/>
          position.<lb n="20410"/> </said>
           <said who="Mary Dedalus">―And they're a very rich order, aren't they, Simon? <lb n="20411"/> </said>
           <said who="Simon Dedalus">―Rather. They live well, I tell you. You saw their table at <lb n="20412"/>
           <place><location><geo>53.310770, -6.684719</geo></location><placeName>Clongowes</placeName></place>. Fed up, by God, like gamecocks. <lb n="20413"/></said> </p>
          <p>  Mr Dedalus pushed his plate over to Stephen and bade him <lb n="20414"/>
          finish what was on it. <lb n="20415"/>
           <said who="Simon Dedalus">―Now then, Stephen, he said. You must put your shoulder to <lb n="20416"/>
          the wheel, old chap. You've had a fine long holiday. <lb n="20417"/> </said>
           <said who="Mary Dedalus">―O, I'm sure  he'll work very hard now, said Mrs Dedalus. <lb n="20418"/>
          Especially when he has Maurice with him. <lb n="20419"/> </said>
           <said who="Simon Dedalus">―O, Holy Paul, I forgot about Maurice, said Mr Dedalus. <lb n="20420"/>
          Here, Maurice! Come here, you thickheaded ruffian! Do you <lb n="20421"/>
          know I'm going to send you to a college where they'll teach you <lb n="20422"/>
          to spell c.a.t: cat. And I'll buy you a nice little penny handker- <lb n="20423"/>
          chief to keep your nose dry. Won't that be grand fun? <lb n="20424"/></said> </p>
          <p>  Maurice grinned at his father and then at his brother. Mr <lb n="20425"/>
          Dedalus screwed his glass into his eye and stared hard at both <lb n="20426"/>
          his sons. Stephen mumbled his bread without answering his <lb n="20427"/>
          father's gaze. <lb n="20428"/>
           <said who="Simon Dedalus">―By the bye, said Mr Dedalus at length, the rector, or provin- <lb n="20429"/>
          cial, rather, was telling me that story about you and Father <lb n="20430"/>
          Dolan. You're an impudent thief, he said. <lb n="20431"/> </said>
           <said who="Mary Dedalus">―O, he didn't, Simon! <lb n="20432"/> </said>
           <said who="Simon Dedalus">―Not he! said Mr Dedalus. But he gave me a great account of <lb n="20433"/>
          the whole affair. We were chatting, you know, and one word <lb n="20434"/>
          borrowed another. And, by the way, who do you think he told <lb n="20435"/>
          me will get that job in the corporation? But I'll tell you that <lb n="20436"/>
          after. Well, as I was saying, we were chatting away quite <lb n="20437"/>
          friendly and he asked me did our friend here wear glasses still <lb n="20438"/>
          and then he told me the whole story. <lb n="20439"/> </said>
           <said who="Mary Dedalus">―And was he annoyed, Simon? <lb n="20440"/> </said>
           <said who="Simon Dedalus">―Annoyed! Not he! <emph>Manly little chap!</emph> he said. <lb n="20441"/></said> </p>
          <p>  Mr Dedalus imitated the mincing nasal tone of the provin- <lb n="20442"/>
          cial. <lb n="20443"/>
          <said who="Simon Dedalus">―Father Dolan and I, when I told them all at dinner about it, <lb n="20444"/>
          Father Dolan and I had a great laugh over it. <emph>You better mind <lb n="20445"/>
          yourself, Father Dolan</emph>, said I, <emph>or young Dedalus will send you <lb n="20446"/>
          up for twice nine</emph>. We had a famous laugh together over it. Ha! <lb n="20447"/>
          Ha! Ha!<lb n="20448"/></said> </p>
          <p>  Mr Dedalus turned to his wife and interjected in his natural <lb n="20449"/>
          voice: <lb n="20450"/>
           <said who="Simon Dedalus">―Shows you the spirit in which they take the boys there. O, a <lb n="20451"/>
          jesuit for your life, for diplomacy! <lb n="20452"/></said> </p>
          <p>  He reassumed the provincial's voice and repeated: <lb n="20453"/>
           <said who="Simon Dedalus">―<emph>I told them all at dinner about it and Father Dolan and I and <lb n="20454"/>

          <p>  The night of the Whitsuntide play had come and Stephen <lb n="20456"/>
          from the window of the dressingroom looked out on  the small <lb n="20457"/>
          grassplot across which lines of Chinese lanterns were stretched. <lb n="20458"/>
          He watched the visitors come down the steps from the house <lb n="20459"/>
          and pass into the theatre. Stewards in evening dress, old Belve- <lb n="20460"/>
          dereans, loitered in groups about the entrance to the theatre <lb n="20461"/>
          and ushered in the visitors with ceremony. Under the sudden <lb n="20462"/>
          glow of a lantern he could recognise the smiling face of a priest.<lb n="20463"/> </p>
          <p>  The Blessed Sacrament had been removed from the taber- <lb n="20464"/>
          nacle and the first benches had been driven back so as to leave <lb n="20465"/>
          the dais of the altar and the space before it free. Against the <lb n="20466"/>
          walls stood companies of barbells and Indian clubs; the dumb- <lb n="20467"/>
          bells were piled in one corner: and in the midst of countless <lb n="20468"/>
          hillocks of gymnasium shoes and sweaters and singlets in <lb n="20469"/>
          untidy brown parcels there stood the stout leatherjacketed <lb n="20470"/>
          vaulting horse waiting its turn to be carried up on to the stage. <lb n="20471"/>
          A large bronze shield, tipped with silver, leaned against the <lb n="20472"/>
          panel of the altar also waiting its turn to be carried up on to the <lb n="20473"/>
          stage and set in the middle of the winning team at the end of <lb n="20474"/>
          the gymnastic  display.<lb n="20475"/> </p>
          <p>  Stephen, though in deference to his reputation for essay- <lb n="20476"/>
          writing he had been elected secretary to the gymnasium, had }omit{ no <lb n="20477"/>
          part in the first section of the programme: but in the play <lb n="20478"/>
          which formed the second section he had the chief part, that of a <lb n="20479"/>
          farcical pedagogue. He had been cast for it on account of his <lb n="20480"/>
          stature and grave manners for he was now at the end of his <lb n="20481"/>
          second year at Belvedere and in number two.<lb n="20482"/> </p>
          <p>  A score of the younger boys in white knickers and singlets <lb n="20483"/>
          came pattering down from the stage, through the vestry and <lb n="20484"/>
          into the chapel. The vestry and chapel were peopled with eager <lb n="20485"/>
          masters and boys. The plump bald sergeantmajor was testing <lb n="20486"/>
          with his foot the springboard of the vaulting horse. The lean <lb n="20487"/>
          young man in a long overcoat, who was to give a special <lb n="20488"/>
          display of intricate club swinging, stood near watching with <lb n="20489"/>
          interest, his silvercoated clubs peeping out of his deep side- <lb n="20490"/>
          pockets. The hollow rattle of the wooden dumbbells was heard <lb n="20491"/>
          as another team made ready to go up on the stage: and in <lb n="20492"/>
          another moment the excited prefect was hustling the boys <lb n="20493"/>
          through the vestry like a flock of geese, flapping the wings of <lb n="20494"/>
          his soutane nervously and crying to the laggards to make haste. <lb n="20495"/>
          A little troop  of Neapolitan peasants were practising their steps <lb n="20496"/>
          at the end of the chapel, some arching their arms above their <lb n="20497"/>
          heads, some swaying their baskets of paper violets and curtsey- <lb n="20498"/>
          ing. In a dark corner of the chapel at the gospel side of the altar <lb n="20499"/>
          a stout old lady knelt amid her copious black skirts. When she <lb n="20500"/>
          stood up a pinkdressed figure, wearing a curly golden wig and <lb n="20501"/>
          an oldfashioned straw sunbonnet, with black pencilled eye- <lb n="20502"/>
          brows and cheeks delicately rouged and powdered, was dis- <lb n="20503"/>
          covered. A low murmur of curiosity ran round the chapel at the <lb n="20504"/>
          discovery of this girlish figure. One of the prefects, smiling and <lb n="20505"/>
          nodding his head, approached the dark corner and, having <lb n="20506"/>
          bowed to the stout old lady, said pleasantly: <lb n="20507"/>
           <said who="a prefect">―Is this a beautiful young lady or a doll that you have here, <lb n="20508"/>
          Mrs Tallon?<lb n="20509"/></said> </p>
          <p>  Then, bending down to peer at the smiling painted face un- <lb n="20510"/>
          der the leaf of the bonnet, he exclaimed: <lb n="20511"/>
           <said who="a prefect">―No! Upon my word I believe it's little Bertie Tallon after all! <lb n="20512"/></said> </p>
          <p>  Stephen at his post by the window heard the old lady and <lb n="20513"/>
          the priest laugh together and heard the boys' murmur of ad- <lb n="20514"/>
          miration behind him as they pressed forward to see the little <lb n="20515"/>
          boy who had to dance the sunbonnet dance by himself. A <lb n="20516"/>
          movement of impatience escaped him. He let the edge of the <lb n="20517"/>
          blind fall and, stepping down from the bench on which he had <lb n="20518"/>
          been standing, walked out of the chapel.<lb n="20519"/> </p>
          <p>  He passed out of the schoolhouse and halted under the shed <lb n="20520"/>
          that flanked the garden. From the theatre opposite came the <lb n="20521"/>
          muffled noise of the audience and sudden brazen clashes of the <lb n="20522"/>
          soldiers' band. The light spread upwards from the glass roof <lb n="20523"/>
          making the theatre seem a festive ark, anchored amid the hulks <lb n="20524"/>
          of houses, her frail cables of lanterns looping her to her moor- <lb n="20525"/>
          ings. A sidedoor of the theatre opened suddenly and a shaft of <lb n="20526"/>
          light flew across the grassplots. A sudden burst of music issued <lb n="20527"/>
          from the ark, the prelude of a waltz: and when the sidedoor <lb n="20528"/>
          closed again the listener could hear the faint rhythm of the <lb n="20529"/>
          music. The sentiment of the opening bars, their languor and <lb n="20530"/>
          supple movement, evoked the incommunicable emotion which <lb n="20531"/>
          had been the cause of all his day's unrest and of his impatient <lb n="20532"/>
          movement of a moment before. His unrest issued from him like <lb n="20533"/>
          a wave of sound: and on the tide of flowing music the ark was <lb n="20534"/>
          journeying, trailing her cables of lanterns in her wake. Then a <lb n="20535"/>
          noise like dwarf artillery broke the movement. It was the <lb n="20536"/>
          clapping that greeted the entry of the dumbbell team on the <lb n="20537"/>
          stage.<lb n="20538"/> </p>
          <p>  At the far end of the shed near the street a speck of pink <lb n="20539"/>
          light showed in the darkness and as he walked towards it he <lb n="20540"/>
          became aware of a faint aromatic odour. Two boys were <lb n="20541"/>
          standing in the shelter of the doorway, smoking, and before he <lb n="20542"/>
          reached them he had recognised Heron by his voice. <lb n="20543"/>
           <said who="Heron">―Here comes the noble Dedalus! cried a high throaty voice. <lb n="20544"/>
          Welcome to our trusty friend! <lb n="20545"/></said> </p>
          <p>  This welcome ended in a soft peal of mirthless laughter as <lb n="20546"/>
          Heron salaamed and then began to poke the ground with his <lb n="20547"/>
          cane. <lb n="20548"/>
           <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Here I am, said Stephen, halting and glancing from Heron to <lb n="20549"/>
          his friend. <lb n="20550"/></said> </p>
          <p>  The latter was a stranger to him but in the darkness, by the <lb n="20551"/>
          aid of the glowing cigarette tips, he could make out a pale <lb n="20552"/>
          dandyish face, over which a smile was travelling slowly, a tall <lb n="20553"/>
          overcoated figure and a hard hat. Heron did not trouble him- <lb n="20554"/>
          self about an introduction but said instead: <lb n="20555"/>
           <said who="Heron">―I was just telling my friend Wallis what a lark it would be <lb n="20556"/>
          tonight if you took off the rector in the part of the school- <lb n="20557"/>
          master. It would be a ripping good joke. <lb n="20558"/></said> </p>
          <p>  Heron made a poor attempt to imitate for his friend Wallis <lb n="20559"/>
          the rector's pedantic bass and then, laughing at his failure, <lb n="20560"/>
          asked Stephen to do it. <lb n="20561"/>
           <said who="Heron">―Go on, Dedalus, he urged. You can take him off rippingly. <lb n="20562"/>
          <lg>
            <l>He that will not hear the churcha let him be to theea as</l> <l>the <lb n="20563"/>
            heathena and the publicana.</l> <lb n="20564"/>
          </lg> </said></p>
          <p>  The imitation was prevented by a mild expression of anger <lb n="20565"/>
          from Wallis in whose mouthpiece the cigarette had become too <lb n="20566"/>
          tightly wedged. <lb n="20567"/>
           <said who="Wallis">―Damn this blankety blank holder, he said, taking it from his <lb n="20568"/>
          mouth and smiling and frowning upon it tolerantly. It's always <lb n="20569"/>
          getting stuck like that. Do you use a holder? <lb n="20570"/> </said>
           <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―I don't smoke, answered Stephen. <lb n="20571"/> </said>
           <said who="Heron">―No, said Heron, Dedalus is a model youth. He doesn't <lb n="20572"/>
          smoke and he doesn't go to bazaars and he doesn't flirt and he <lb n="20573"/>
          doesn't damn anything or damn all. <lb n="20574"/></said> </p>
          <p>  Stephen shook his head and smiled in his rival's flushed and <lb n="20575"/>
          mobile face, beaked like a bird's. He had often thought it <lb n="20576"/>
          strange that Vincent Heron had a bird's face as well as a bird's <lb n="20577"/>
          name. A shock of pale hair lay on the forehead like a ruffled <lb n="20578"/>
          crest: the forehead was narrow and bony and a thin hooked <lb n="20579"/>
          nose stood out between the closeset prominent eyes which were <lb n="20580"/>
          light and inexpressive. The rivals were school friends. They sat <lb n="20581"/>
          together in class, knelt together in the chapel, talked together <lb n="20582"/>
          after beads over their lunches. As the fellows in number one <lb n="20583"/>
          were undistinguished dullards Stephen and Heron had been <lb n="20584"/>
          during the year the virtual heads of the school. It was they who <lb n="20585"/>
          went up to the rector together to ask for a free day or to get a <lb n="20586"/>
          fellow off. <lb n="20587"/>
           <said who="Heron">―O by the way, said Heron suddenly, I saw your governor <lb n="20588"/>
          going in. <lb n="20589"/></said> </p>
          <p>  The smile waned on Stephen's face. Any allusion made to his <lb n="20590"/>
          father by a fellow or by a master put his calm to rout in a <lb n="20591"/>
          moment. He waited in timorous silence to hear what Heron <lb n="20592"/>
          might say next. Heron, however, nudged him expressively with <lb n="20593"/>
          his elbow and said: <lb n="20594"/>
           <said who="Heron">―You're a sly dog, Dedalus! <lb n="20595"/> </said>
           <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Why so? said Stephen. <lb n="20596"/> </said>
           <said who="Heron">―You'd think butter wouldn't melt in your mouth, said <lb n="20597"/>
          Heron. But I'm afraid you're a sly dog. <lb n="20598"/> </said>
           <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Might I ask you what you are talking about? said Stephen <lb n="20599"/>
          urbanely.<lb n="20600"/> </said>
           <said who="Heron">―Indeed  you might, answered Heron. We saw her, Wallis, <lb n="20601"/>
          didn't we? And deucedly pretty she is too. And so inquisitive! <lb n="20602"/>
          <emph>And what part does Stephen take, Mr Dedalus? And will <lb n="20603"/>
          Stephen not sing, Mr Dedalus?</emph> Your governor was staring at <lb n="20604"/>
          her through that eyeglass of his for all he was worth so that I <lb n="20605"/>
          think the old man has found you out too. I wouldn't care a bit, <lb n="20606"/>
          by Jove. She's  ripping, isn't she, Wallis? <lb n="20607"/> </said>
           <said who="Wallis">―Not half bad, answered Wallis quietly as he placed his <lb n="20608"/>
          holder once more in a corner of his mouth. <lb n="20609"/></said> </p>
          <p>  A shaft of momentary anger flew through Stephen's mind at <lb n="20610"/>
          these indelicate allusions in the hearing of a stranger. For him <lb n="20611"/>
          there was nothing amusing in a girl's interest and regard. All <lb n="20612"/>
          day he had thought of nothing but their leavetaking on the <lb n="20613"/>
          steps of the tram at <place><location><geo>53.324608, -6.281580</geo></location><placeName>Harold's Cross</placeName></place>, the stream of moody <lb n="20614"/>
          emotions it had made to course through him and the poem he <lb n="20615"/>
          had written about it. All day he had imagined a new meeting <lb n="20616"/>
          with her for he knew that she was to come to the play. The old <lb n="20617"/>
          restless moodiness had again filled his heart as it had done on <lb n="20618"/>
          the night of the party but had not found  an outlet in verse. The <lb n="20619"/>
          growth and knowledge of two years of boyhood stood between <lb n="20620"/>
          then and now, forbidding such an outlet: and all day the stream <lb n="20621"/>
          of gloomy tenderness within him had started forth and re- <lb n="20622"/>
          turned upon itself in dark courses and eddies, wearying him in <lb n="20623"/>
          the end until the pleasantry of the prefect and the painted little <lb n="20624"/>
          boy had drawn from him a movement of impatience. <lb n="20625"/>
           <said who="Heron">―So you may as well admit, Heron went on, that we've fairly <lb n="20626"/>
          found you out this time. You can't play the saint on me any <lb n="20627"/>
          more, that's one sure five. <lb n="20628"/></said> </p>
          <p>  A soft peal of mirthless laughter escaped from his lips and, <lb n="20629"/>
          bending down as before, he struck Stephen lightly across the <lb n="20630"/>
          calf of the leg with his cane, as if in jesting reproof.<lb n="20631"/> </p>
          <p>  Stephen's moment of anger had already passed. He was nei- <lb n="20632"/>
          ther flattered nor confused but simply wished the banter to <lb n="20633"/>
          end. He scarcely resented what had seemed to him at first a <lb n="20634"/>
          silly indelicateness for he knew that the adventure in his mind <lb n="20635"/>
          stood in no danger from their words: and his face mirrored his <lb n="20636"/>
          rival's false smile. <lb n="20637"/>
           <said who="Heron">―Admit! repeated Heron, striking him again with his cane <lb n="20638"/>
          across the calf of the leg. <lb n="20639"/></said> </p>
          <p>  The stroke was playful but not so lightly given as the first <lb n="20640"/>
          one had been. Stephen felt the skin tingle and glow slightly and <lb n="20641"/>
          almost painlessly; and bowing submissively, as if to meet his <lb n="20642"/>
          companion's jesting mood, began to recite the <seg xml:lang="la">Confiteor</seg>. The <lb n="20643"/>
          episode ended well for both Heron and Wallis laughed indul- <lb n="20644"/>
          gently at the irreverence.<lb n="20645"/> </p>
          <p>  The confession came only from Stephen's lips and, while <lb n="20646"/>
          they spoke the words, a sudden memory had carried him to <lb n="20647"/>
          another scene called up, as if by magic, at the moment when he <lb n="20648"/>
          had noted the faint cruel dimples at the corners of Heron's <lb n="20649"/>
          smiling lips and had felt the familiar stroke of the cane against <lb n="20650"/>
          his calf and had heard the familiar word of admonition: <lb n="20651"/>
          <said who="Heron">―Admit!<lb n="20652"/></said> </p>
          <p>  It was towards the close of his first term in the college when <lb n="20653"/>
          he was in number six. His sensitive nature was still smarting <lb n="20654"/>
          under the lashes of an undivined and squalid way of life. His <lb n="20655"/>
          soul was still disquieted and cast down by the dull phenom- <lb n="20656"/>
          enon of <place><location><geo>53.349307, -6.263654</geo></location><placeName>Dublin</placeName></place>. He had emerged from a two years' spell of <lb n="20657"/>
          revery to find himself in the midst of a new scene, every event <lb n="20658"/>
          and figure of which affected him intimately, disheartened him <lb n="20659"/>
          or allured him and, whether alluring or disheartening, filled <lb n="20660"/>
          him always with unrest and bitter thoughts. All the leisure that <lb n="20661"/>
          his school life left him was passed in the company of subversive <lb n="20662"/>
          writers whose gibes and violence of speech set up a ferment in <lb n="20663"/>
          his brain before they passed out of it into his crude writings.<lb n="20664"/> </p>
          <p>  The essay was for him the chief labour of his week and every <lb n="20665"/>
          Tuesday, as he marched from home to the school, he read his <lb n="20666"/>
          fate in the incidents of the way, pitting himself against some <lb n="20667"/>
          figure ahead of him and quickening his pace to outstrip it be- <lb n="20668"/>
          fore a certain goal was reached or planting his steps scrupu- <lb n="20669"/>
          lously in the spaces of the patchwork of the footpath and <lb n="20670"/>
          telling himself that he would be first and not first in the weekly <lb n="20671"/>
          essay.<lb n="20672"/> </p>
          <p>  On a certain Tuesday the course of his triumphs was rudely <lb n="20673"/>
          broken. Mr Tate, the English master, pointed his finger at him <lb n="20674"/>
          and said bluntly: <lb n="20675"/>
           <said who="Mr Tate">―This fellow has heresy in his essay. <lb n="20676"/></said> </p>
          <p>  A hush fell on the class. Mr Tate did not break it but dug <lb n="20677"/>
          with his hand between his crossed thighs while his heavily <lb n="20678"/>
          starched linen creaked about his neck and wrists. Stephen did <lb n="20679"/>
          not look up. It was a raw spring morning and his eyes were still <lb n="20680"/>
          smarting and weak. He was conscious of failure and of detec- <lb n="20681"/>
          tion, of the squalor of his own mind and home, and felt against <lb n="20682"/>
          his neck the raw edge of his turned and jagged collar.<lb n="20683"/> </p>
          <p>  A short loud laugh from Mr Tate set the class more at ease. <lb n="20684"/>
           <said who="Mr Tate">―Perhaps you didn't know that, he said. <lb n="20685"/> </said>
           <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Where? asked Stephen. <lb n="20686"/></said> </p>
          <p>  Mr Tate withdrew his delving hand and spread out the es- <lb n="20687"/>
          say. <lb n="20688"/>
           <said who="Mr Tate">―Here. It's about the Creator and the soul. Rrm ... rrm ..... <lb n="20689"/>
          rrm ...  Ah! <emph>without a possibility of ever approaching nearer</emph>. <lb n="20690"/>
          That's heresy. <lb n="20691"/></said> </p>
          <p>  Stephen murmured: <lb n="20692"/>
           <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―I meant <emph>without a possibility of ever reaching</emph>. <lb n="20693"/></said> </p>
          <p>  It was a submission and Mr Tate, appeased, folded up the <lb n="20694"/>
          essay and passed it across to him, saying: <lb n="20695"/>
           <said who="Mr Tate">―O ... Ah! <emph>ever reaching</emph>. That's another story. <lb n="20696"/></said> </p>
          <p>  But the class was not so soon appeased. Though nobody <lb n="20697"/>
          spoke to him of the affair after class he could feel about him a <lb n="20698"/>
          vague general malignant joy.<lb n="20699"/> </p>
          <p>  A few nights after this public chiding  he was walking with a <lb n="20700"/>
          letter along the Drumcondra Road when he heard a voice cry: <lb n="20701"/>
           <said who="Heron">―Halt! <lb n="20702"/></said> </p>
          <p>  He turned and saw three boys of his own class coming to- <lb n="20703"/>
          wards him in the dusk. It was Heron who had called out and, <lb n="20704"/>
          as he marched forward between his two attendants, he cleft the <lb n="20705"/>
          air before him with a thin cane, in time to their steps. Boland, <lb n="20706"/>
          his friend, marched beside him, a large grin on his face, while <lb n="20707"/>
          Nash came on a few steps behind, blowing from the pace and <lb n="20708"/>
          wagging his great red head.<lb n="20709"/> </p>
          <p>  As soon as the boys had turned into <place><location><geo>53.362304, -6.249867</geo></location><placeName>Clonliffe Road</placeName></place>together <lb n="20710"/>
          they began to speak about books and writers, saying what <lb n="20711"/>
          books they were reading and how many books there were in <lb n="20712"/>
          their fathers' bookcases at home. Stephen listened to them in <lb n="20713"/>
          some wonderment for Boland was the dunce and Nash the idler <lb n="20714"/>
          of the class. In fact after some talk about their favourite writers <lb n="20715"/>
          Nash declared for Captain Marryat who, he said, was the <lb n="20716"/>
          greatest writer. <lb n="20717"/>
           <said who="Heron">―Fudge! said Heron. Ask Dedalus. Who is the greatest writer, <lb n="20718"/>
          Dedalus?<lb n="20719"/></said> </p>
          <p>  Stephen noted the mockery in the question and said: <lb n="20720"/>
           <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Of prose, do you mean? <lb n="20721"/> </said>
           <said who="Heron">―Yes.<lb n="20722"/> </said>
           <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Newman, I think. <lb n="20723"/> </said>
           <said who="Boland">―Is it Cardinal Newman? asked Boland. <lb n="20724"/> </said>
           <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Yes, answered Stephen. <lb n="20725"/></said> </p>
          <p>  The grin broadened on Nash's freckled face as he turned to <lb n="20726"/>
          Stephen and said: <lb n="20727"/>
           <said who="Nash">―And do you like Cardinal Newman, Dedalus? <lb n="20728"/> </said>
           <said who="Heron">―O, many people say that Newman has the best prose style, <lb n="20729"/>
          Heron said to the other two in explanation. Of course, he's not <lb n="20730"/>
          a poet. <lb n="20731"/> </said>
           <said who="Boland">―And who is the best poet, Heron? asked Boland. <lb n="20732"/> </said>
           <said who="Heron">―Lord Tennyson, of course, answered Heron. <lb n="20733"/> </said>
           <said who="Nash">―O, yes, Lord Tennyson, said Nash. We have all his poetry at <lb n="20734"/>
          home in a book. <lb n="20735"/></said> </p>
          <p>  At this Stephen forgot the silent vows he had been making <lb n="20736"/>
          and burst out: <lb n="20737"/>
           <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Tennyson a poet! Why, he's only a rhymester! <lb n="20738"/> </said>
           <said who="Heron">―O, get out! said Heron. Everyone knows that Tennyson is <lb n="20739"/>
          the greatest poet. <lb n="20740"/> </said>
           <said who="Boland">―And who do you think is the greatest poet? asked Boland, <lb n="20741"/>
          nudging his neighbour. <lb n="20742"/> </said>
           <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Byron, of course, answered Stephen. <lb n="20743"/></said> </p>
          <p>  Heron gave the lead and all three joined in a scornful laugh. <lb n="20744"/>
           <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―What are you laughing at? asked Stephen. <lb n="20745"/> </said>
           <said who="Heron">―You, said Heron. Byron the greatest poet! He's only a poet <lb n="20746"/>
          for uneducated people. <lb n="20747"/> </said>
           <said who="Boland">―He must be a fine poet! said Boland. <lb n="20748"/> </said>
           <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―You may keep your mouth shut, said Stephen, turning on <lb n="20749"/>
          him boldly. All you know about poetry is what you wrote up <lb n="20750"/>
          on the slates in the yard and were going to be sent to the loft <lb n="20751"/>
          for.<lb n="20752"/></said> </p>
          <p>  Boland, in fact, was said to have written on the slates in the <lb n="20753"/>
          yard a couplet about a classmate of his who often rode home <lb n="20754"/>
          from the college on a pony:<lb n="20755"/> </p>
          <lg>
             <l>As Tyson was riding into Jerusalem</l> <lb n="20756"/>
             <l>He fell and hurt his Alec Kafoozelum.</l> <lb n="20757"/>
          </lg>
          <p>  This thrust put the two lieutenants to silence but Heron <lb n="20758"/>
          went on: <lb n="20759"/>
           <said who="Heron">―In any case Byron was a heretic and immoral too. <lb n="20760"/> </said>
           <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―I don't care what he was, cried Stephen hotly. <lb n="20761"/> </said>
           <said who="Nash">―You don't care whether he was a heretic or not? said Nash. <lb n="20762"/> </said>
           <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―What do you know about it? shouted Stephen. You never <lb n="20763"/>
          read a line of anything in your life except a trans or Boland <lb n="20764"/>
          either.<lb n="20765"/> </said>
           <said who="Boland">―I know that Byron was a bad man, said Boland. <lb n="20766"/> </said>
           <said who="Heron">―Here, Catch hold of this heretic, Heron called out. <lb n="20767"/></said> </p>
          <p>  In a moment Stephen was a prisoner. <lb n="20768"/>
           <said who="Heron">―Tate made you buck up the other day, Heron went on, about <lb n="20769"/>
          the heresy in your essay. <lb n="20770"/> </said>
           <said who="Boland">―I'll tell him tomorrow, said Boland. <lb n="20771"/> </said>
           <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Will you? said Stephen. You'd be afraid to open your lips. <lb n="20772"/> </said>
           <said who="Boland">―Afraid?<lb n="20773"/> </said>
           <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Ay. Afraid of your life. <lb n="20774"/> </said>
           <said who="Heron">―Behave yourself! cried Heron, cutting at Stephen's legs with <lb n="20775"/>
          his cane. <lb n="20776"/></said> </p>
          <p>  It was the signal for their  onset. Nash pinioned his arms <lb n="20777"/>
          behind while Boland seized a long cabbage stump which was <lb n="20778"/>
          lying in the gutter. Struggling and kicking under the cuts of the <lb n="20779"/>
          cane and the blows of the knotty stump Stephen was borne <lb n="20780"/>
          back against a barbed wire fence. <lb n="20781"/>
           <said who="Heron">―Admit that Byron was no good. <lb n="20782"/> </said>
           <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―No.<lb n="20783"/> </said>
           <said who="Heron">―Admit.<lb n="20784"/> </said>
           <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―No.<lb n="20785"/> </said>
           <said who="Heron">―Admit.<lb n="20786"/> </said>
           <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―No. No. <lb n="20787"/></said> </p>
          <p>  At last after a fury of plunges he wrenched himself free. His <lb n="20788"/>
          tormentors set off towards <place><location><geo>53.360891, -6.251230</geo></location><placeName>Jones's Road</placeName></place>, laughing and jeering <lb n="20789"/>
          at him, while he, }omit{ half blinded with tears, stumbled on, clench- <lb n="20790"/>
          ing his fists madly and sobbing.<lb n="20791"/> </p>
          <p>  While he was still repeating the <seg xml:lang="la">Confiteor</seg> amid the indul- <lb n="20792"/>
          gent laughter of his hearers and while the scenes of that <lb n="20793"/>
          malignant episode were still passing sharply and swiftly before <lb n="20794"/>
          his mind he wondered why he bore no malice now to those <lb n="20795"/>
          who had tormented him. He had not forgotten a whit of their <lb n="20796"/>
          cowardice and cruelty but the memory of it called forth no <lb n="20797"/>
          anger from him. All the descriptions of fierce love and hatred <lb n="20798"/>
          which he had met in books had  seemed to him therefore unreal. <lb n="20799"/>
          Even that night as he stumbled homewards along <place><location><geo>53.360891, -6.251230</geo></location><placeName>Jones's Road</placeName></place> <lb n="20800"/>
          he had felt that some power was divesting him of that sudden- <lb n="20801"/>
          woven anger as easily as a fruit is divested of her soft ripe peel.<lb n="20802"/> </p>
          <p>  He remained standing with his two companions at the end <lb n="20803"/>
          of the shed, listening idly to their talk or to the bursts of <lb n="20804"/>
          applause in the theatre. She was sitting there among the others, <lb n="20805"/>
          perhaps waiting for him to appear. He tried to recall her ap- <lb n="20806"/>
          pearance but could not. He could remember only that she had <lb n="20807"/>
          worn a shawl about her head like a cowl and that her dark eyes <lb n="20808"/>
          had invited and unnerved him. He wondered had he been in her <lb n="20809"/>
          thoughts as she had been in his. Then in the dark and unseen <lb n="20810"/>
          by the other two he rested the tips of the fingers of one hand <lb n="20811"/>
          upon the palm of the other hand, scarcely touching it and yet <lb n="20812"/>
          pressing upon it lightly. But the pressure of her fingers had <lb n="20813"/>
          been lighter and steadier: and suddenly the memory of their <lb n="20814"/>
          touch traversed his brain and body like an invisible warm <lb n="20815"/>
          wave.<lb n="20816"/> </p>
          <p>  A boy came towards them, running along under the shed. <lb n="20817"/>
          He was excited and breathless. <lb n="20818"/>
           <said who="a boy">―O, Dedalus, he cried, Doyle is in a great bake about you. <lb n="20819"/>
          You're to go in at once and get dressed for the play. Hurry up, <lb n="20820"/>
          you better. <lb n="20821"/> </said>
           <said who="Heron">―He's coming now, said Heron to the messenger with a <lb n="20822"/>
          haughty drawl, when he wants to. <lb n="20823"/></said> </p>
          <p>  The boy turned to Heron and repeated: <lb n="20824"/>
           <said who="a boy">―But Doyle is in an awful bake. <lb n="20825"/> </said>
           <said who="Heron">―Will you tell Doyle with my best compliments that I damned <lb n="20826"/>
          his eyes? answered Heron. <lb n="20827"/> </said>
           <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Well, I must go now, said Stephen who cared little for such <lb n="20828"/>
          points of honour. <lb n="20829"/> </said>
           <said who="Heron">―I wouldn't, said Heron, damn me if I would. That's no way <lb n="20830"/>
          to send for one of the senior boys. In a bake, indeed! I think it's <lb n="20831"/>
          quite enough that you're taking a part in his bally old play. <lb n="20832"/></said> </p>
          <p>  This spirit of quarrelsome comradeship which he had ob- <lb n="20833"/>
          served lately in his rival had not seduced Stephen from his <lb n="20834"/>
          habits of quiet obedience. He mistrusted the turbulence and <lb n="20835"/>
          doubted the sincerity of such comradeship which seemed to <lb n="20836"/>
          him a sorry anticipation of manhood. The question of honour <lb n="20837"/>
          here raised was, like all such questions, trivial to him. While his <lb n="20838"/>
          mind had been pursuing its intangible phantoms and turning in <lb n="20839"/>
          irresolution from such pursuit he had heard about him the <lb n="20840"/>
          constant voices of his father and of his masters, urging him to <lb n="20841"/>
          be a gentleman above all things and urging him to be a good <lb n="20842"/>
          catholic above all things. These voices had now come to be <lb n="20843"/>
          hollowsounding in his ears. When the gymnasium had been <lb n="20844"/>
          opened he had heard another voice urging him to be strong and <lb n="20845"/>
          manly and healthy and when the movement towards national <lb n="20846"/>
          revival had begun to be felt in the college yet another voice had <lb n="20847"/>
          bidden him  be true to his country and help to raise up her <lb n="20848"/>
          fallen language and tradition. In the profane world, as he <lb n="20849"/>
          foresaw, a worldly voice would bid him raise up his father's <lb n="20850"/>
          fallen state by his labours and, meanwhile, the voice of his <lb n="20851"/>
          schoolcomrades urged him to be a decent fellow, to shield <lb n="20852"/>
          others from blame or to beg them off and to do his best to get <lb n="20853"/>
          free days for the school. And it was the din of all these hollow- <lb n="20854"/>
          sounding voices that made him halt irresolutely in the pursuit <lb n="20855"/>
          of phantoms. He gave them ear only for a time but he was <lb n="20856"/>
          happy only when he was far from them, beyond their call, <lb n="20857"/>
          alone or in the company of phantasmal comrades.<lb n="20858"/> </p>
          <p>  In the vestry a plump freshfaced jesuit and an elderly man, in <lb n="20859"/>
          shabby blue clothes, were dabbling in a case of paints and <lb n="20860"/>
          chalks. The boys who had been painted walked about or stood <lb n="20861"/>
          still awkwardly, touching their faces in a gingerly fashion with <lb n="20862"/>
          their furtive fingertips. In the middle of the vestry a young <lb n="20863"/>
          jesuit, who was then on a visit to the college, stood rocking <lb n="20864"/>
          himself rhythmically from the tips of his toes to his heels and <lb n="20865"/>
          back again, his hands thrust well forward into his sidepockets. <lb n="20866"/>
          His small head set off with glossy red curls and his newly <lb n="20867"/>
          shaven face agreed well with the spotless decency of his soutane <lb n="20868"/>
          and with his spotless shoes.<lb n="20869"/> </p>
          <p>  As he watched this swaying form and tried to read for him- <lb n="20870"/>
          self the legend of the priest's mocking smile there came into <lb n="20871"/>
          Stephen's memory a saying which he had heard from his father <lb n="20872"/>
          before he had been sent to <place><location><geo>53.310770, -6.684719</geo></location><placeName>Clongowes</placeName></place>, that you could always <lb n="20873"/>
          tell a jesuit by the style of his clothes. At the same moment he <lb n="20874"/>
          thought he saw a likeness between his father's mind and that of <lb n="20875"/>
          this smiling welldressed priest: and he was aware of some des- <lb n="20876"/>
          ecration of the priest's office or of the vestry itself, whose si- <lb n="20877"/>
          lence was now routed by loud talk and joking and its air <lb n="20878"/>
          pungent with the smells of the gasjets and the grease.<lb n="20879"/> </p>
          <p>  While his forehead was being wrinkled and his jaws painted <lb n="20880"/>
          black and blue by the elderly man he listened distractedly to the <lb n="20881"/>
          voice of the plump young jesuit which bade him speak up and <lb n="20882"/>
          make his points clearly. He could hear the band playing <emph>The <lb n="20883"/>
          Lily of Killarney</emph> and knew that in a few moments the curtain <lb n="20884"/>
          would go up. He felt no stage fright but the thought of the part <lb n="20885"/>
          he had to play humiliated him. A remembrance  of some of his <lb n="20886"/>
          lines made a sudden flush rise to his painted cheeks. He saw her <lb n="20887"/>
          serious alluring eyes watching him from among the audience <lb n="20888"/>
          and their image at once swept away his scruples, leaving his <lb n="20889"/>
          will compact. Another nature seemed to have been lent him: <lb n="20890"/>
          the infection of the excitement and youth about him entered <lb n="20891"/>
          into and transformed his moody mistrustfulness. For one rare <lb n="20892"/>
          moment he seemed to be clothed in the real apparel of boy- <lb n="20893"/>
          hood: and, as he stood in the wings among the other players, he <lb n="20894"/>
          shared the common mirth amid which the drop scene was <lb n="20895"/>
          hauled upwards by two ablebodied priests with violent jerks <lb n="20896"/>
          and all awry.<lb n="20897"/> </p>
          <p>  A few moments after he found himself on the stage amid the <lb n="20898"/>
          garish gas and the dim scenery, acting before the innumerable <lb n="20899"/>
          faces of the void. It surprised him to see that the play which he <lb n="20900"/>
          had known at rehearsals for a disjointed lifeless thing had <lb n="20901"/>
          suddenly assumed a life of its own. It seemed now to play itself, <lb n="20902"/>
          he and his fellow actors aiding it with their parts. When the <lb n="20903"/>
          curtain fell on the last scene he heard the void filled with <lb n="20904"/>
          applause and, through a rift in the side scene, saw the simple <lb n="20905"/>
          body before which he had acted magically deformed, the void <lb n="20906"/>
          of faces breaking at all points and falling asunder into busy <lb n="20907"/>
          groups.<lb n="20908"/> </p>
          <p>  He left the stage quickly and rid himself of his mummery <lb n="20909"/>
          and passed out through the chapel into the college garden. <lb n="20910"/>
          Now that the play was over his nerves cried for some further <lb n="20911"/>
          adventure. He hurried onwards as if to overtake it. The doors <lb n="20912"/>
          of the theatre were all open and the audience had emptied out. <lb n="20913"/>
          On the lines which he had fancied the moorings of an ark a few <lb n="20914"/>
          lanterns swung in the night breeze, flickering cheerlessly. He <lb n="20915"/>
          mounted the steps from the garden in haste, eager that some <lb n="20916"/>
          prey should not elude him, and forced his way through the <lb n="20917"/>
          crowd in the hall and past the two jesuits who stood watching <lb n="20918"/>
          the exodus and bowing and shaking hands with the visitors. He <lb n="20919"/>
          pushed onward nervously, feigning a still greater haste and <lb n="20920"/>
          faintly conscious of the smiles and stares and nudges which his <lb n="20921"/>
          powdered head left in its wake.<lb n="20922"/> </p>
          <p>  When he came out on the steps he saw his family waiting for <lb n="20923"/>
          him at the first lamp. In a glance he noted that every figure of <lb n="20924"/>
          the group was familiar and ran down the steps angrily. <lb n="20925"/>
           <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―I have to leave a message down in George's Street, he said to <lb n="20926"/>
          his father quickly. I'll be home after you. <lb n="20927"/></said> </p>
          <p>  Without waiting for his father's questions  he ran across the <lb n="20928"/>
          road and began to walk at breakneck speed down the hill. He <lb n="20929"/>
          hardly knew where he was walking. Pride and hope and desire <lb n="20930"/>
          like crushed herbs in his heart sent up vapours of maddening <lb n="20931"/>
          incense before the eyes of his mind. He strode down the hill <lb n="20932"/>
          amid the tumult of suddenrisen vapours of wounded pride and <lb n="20933"/>
          fallen hope and baffled desire. They streamed upwards before <lb n="20934"/>
          his anguished eyes in dense and maddening fumes and passed <lb n="20935"/>
          away above him till at last the air was clear and cold again.<lb n="20936"/> </p>
          <p>  A film still veiled his eyes but they burned no longer. A <lb n="20937"/>
          power, akin to that which had often made anger or resentment <lb n="20938"/>
          fall from him, brought his steps to rest. He stood still and <lb n="20939"/>
          gazed up at the sombre porch of the morgue and from that to <lb n="20940"/>
          the dark cobbled laneway at its side. He saw the word <emph>Lotts</emph> on <lb n="20941"/>
          the wall of the lane and breathed slowly the rank heavy air.<lb n="20942"/> </p>
          <p> ―That is horse piss and rotted straw, he thought. It is a good <lb n="20943"/>
          odour to breathe. It will calm my heart. My heart is quite calm <lb n="20944"/>
          now. I will go back.<lb n="20945"/> </p>

          now. He saw the darkening lands slipping past him, the silent <lb n="20951"/>
          telegraphpoles passing his window swiftly every four seconds, <lb n="20952"/>
          the little glimmering stations, manned by a few silent sentries, <lb n="20953"/>
          flung by the mail behind her and twinkling for a moment in the <lb n="20954"/>
          darkness like fiery grains flung backwards by a runner.<lb n="20955"/> </p>
          <p>  He listened without sympathy to his father's evocation of <lb n="20956"/>
          Cork and of scenes of his youth, a tale broken by sighs or <lb n="20957"/>
          draughts from his pocket flask whenever the image of some <lb n="20958"/>
          dead friend appeared in it or whenever the evoker remembered <lb n="20959"/>
          suddenly the purpose of his actual visit. Stephen heard but <lb n="20960"/>
          could feel no pity. The images of the dead were all strange to <lb n="20961"/>
          him save that of uncle Charles, an image which had lately been <lb n="20962"/>
          fading out of memory. He knew, however, that his father's <lb n="20963"/>
          property was going to be sold by auction and in the manner of <lb n="20964"/>
          his own dispossession he felt the world give the lie rudely to his <lb n="20965"/>
          phantasy.<lb n="20966"/> </p>
          <p>  At Maryborough he fell asleep. When he awoke the train <lb n="20967"/>
          had passed out of Mallow and his father was stretched asleep <lb n="20968"/>
          on the other seat. The cold light of the dawn lay over the <lb n="20969"/>
          country, over the unpeopled fields and the closed cottages. The <lb n="20970"/>
          terror of sleep fascinated his mind as he watched the silent <lb n="20971"/>
          country or heard from time to time his father's deep breath or <lb n="20972"/>
          sudden sleepy movement. The neighbourhood of unseen <lb n="20973"/>
          sleepers filled him with strange dread as though they could <lb n="20974"/>
          harm him; and he prayed that the day might come quickly. His <lb n="20975"/>
          prayer, addressed neither to God nor saint, began with a shiver, <lb n="20976"/>
          as the chilly morning breeze crept through the chink of the <lb n="20977"/>
          carriage door to his feet, and ended in a trail of foolish words <lb n="20978"/>
          which he made to fit the insistent rhythm of the train: and <lb n="20979"/>
          silently, at intervals of four seconds, the telegraphpoles held the <lb n="20980"/>
          galloping notes of the music between punctual bars. This furi- <lb n="20981"/>
          ous music allayed his dread and, leaning against the window- <lb n="20982"/>
          ledge, he let his eyelids close again.<lb n="20983"/> </p>
          <p>  They drove in a jingle across Cork while it was still early <lb n="20984"/>
          morning and Stephen finished his sleep in a bedroom of the <lb n="20985"/>
          Victoria Hotel. The bright warm sunlight was streaming <lb n="20986"/>
          through the window and he could hear the din of traffic. His <lb n="20987"/>
          father was standing before the dressingtable, examining his <lb n="20988"/>
          hair and face and moustache with great care, craning his neck <lb n="20989"/>
          across the waterjug and drawing it back sideways to see the <lb n="20990"/>
          better. While he did so he sang softly to himself with quaint <lb n="20991"/>
          accent and phrasing: <lb n="20992"/>
          <said who="Simon Dedalus">

          </said>
          </p>
          <p>  The consciousness of the warm sunny city outside his win- <lb n="21009"/>
          dow and the tender tremors with which his father's voice <lb n="21010"/>
          festooned the strange sad happy air drove off all the mists of <lb n="21011"/>
          the night's ill humour from Stephen's brain. He got up quickly <lb n="21012"/>
          to dress and, when the song had ended, said: <lb n="21013"/>
           <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―That's much prettier than any of your other <emph>come-all-yous</emph>. <lb n="21014"/> </said>
           <said who="Simon Dedalus">―Do you think so? asked Mr Dedalus. <lb n="21015"/> </said>
           <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―I like it, said Stephen. <lb n="21016"/> </said>
           <said who="Simon Dedalus">―It's a pretty old air, said Mr Dedalus, twirling the points of <lb n="21017"/>
          his moustache. Ah, but you should have heard Mick Lacy sing <lb n="21018"/>
          it! Poor Mick Lacy! He had little turns for it, grace notes he <lb n="21019"/>
          used to put in that I haven't got. That was the boy }omit{ could sing a <lb n="21020"/>
          <emph>come-all-you</emph>, if you like. <lb n="21021"/></said> </p>
          <p>  Mr Dedalus had ordered drisheens for breakfast and during <lb n="21022"/>
          the meal he crossexamined the waiter for local news. For the <lb n="21023"/>
          most part they spoke at cross purposes when a name was <lb n="21024"/>
          mentioned, the waiter having in mind its present holder and Mr <lb n="21025"/>
          Dedalus his father or perhaps his grandfather. <lb n="21026"/>
           <said who="Simon Dedalus">―Well, I hope they haven't moved the Queen's College any- <lb n="21027"/>
          how, said Mr Dedalus, for I want to show it to this youngster <lb n="21028"/>
          of mine. <lb n="21029"/></said> </p>
          <p>  Along the Mardyke the trees were in bloom. They entered <lb n="21030"/>
          the grounds of the college and were led by the garrulous porter <lb n="21031"/>
          across the quadrangle. But their progress across the gravel was <lb n="21032"/>
          brought to a halt after  every dozen or so paces by some reply of <lb n="21033"/>
          the porter's. <lb n="21034"/>
           <said who="Simon Dedalus">―Ah, do you tell me so? And is poor Pottlebelly dead? <lb n="21035"/> </said>
           <said who="porter">―Yes, sir. Dead, sir. <lb n="21036"/></said> </p>
          <p>  During these halts Stephen stood awkwardly behind the two <lb n="21037"/>
          men, weary of the subject and waiting restlessly for the slow <lb n="21038"/>
          march to begin again. By the time they had crossed the quad- <lb n="21039"/>
          rangle his restlessness had risen to fever. He wondered how his <lb n="21040"/>
          father, whom he knew for a shrewd suspicious man, could be <lb n="21041"/>
          duped by the servile manners of the porter: and the lively <lb n="21042"/>
          southern speech which had entertained him all the morning <lb n="21043"/>
          now irritated his ears.<lb n="21044"/> </p>
          <p>  They passed into the anatomy theatre where Mr Dedalus, <lb n="21045"/>
          the porter aiding him, searched the desks for his initials. Ste- <lb n="21046"/>
          phen remained in the background, depressed more than ever by <lb n="21047"/>
          the darkness and silence of the theatre and by the air it wore of <lb n="21048"/>
          jaded and formal study. On the desk before him he read the <lb n="21049"/>
          word <emph>Foetus</emph>  cut several times in the dark stained wood. The <lb n="21050"/>
          sudden legend startled his blood: he seemed to feel the absent <lb n="21051"/>
          students of the college about him and to shrink from their <lb n="21052"/>
          company. A vision of their life, which his father's words had <lb n="21053"/>
          been powerless to evoke, sprang up before him out of the word <lb n="21054"/>
          cut in the desk. A broadshouldered student with a moustache <lb n="21055"/>
          was cutting in the letters with a jackknife, seriously. Other <lb n="21056"/>
          students stood or sat near him laughing at his handiwork. One <lb n="21057"/>
          jogged his elbow. The big student turned on him, frowning. He <lb n="21058"/>
          was dressed in loose grey clothes and had tan boots.<lb n="21059"/> </p>
          <p>  Stephen's name was called. He hurried down the steps of the <lb n="21060"/>
          theatre so as to be as far away from the vision as he could be <lb n="21061"/>
          and, peering closely at his father's initials, hid his flushed face.<lb n="21062"/> </p>
          <p>  But the word and the vision capered before his eyes as he <lb n="21063"/>
          walked back across the quadrangle and towards the college <lb n="21064"/>
          gate. It shocked him to find in the outer world a trace of what <lb n="21065"/>
          he had deemed till then a brutish and individual malady of his <lb n="21066"/>
          own mind. His recent monstrous reveries came thronging into <lb n="21067"/>
          his memory. They too had sprung up before him, suddenly and <lb n="21068"/>
          furiously, out of mere words. He had soon given in to them and <lb n="21069"/>
          allowed them to sweep across and abase his intellect, wonder- <lb n="21070"/>
          ing always where they came from, from what den of monstrous <lb n="21071"/>
          images, and always weak and humble towards others, restless <lb n="21072"/>
          and sickened of himself when they had swept over him. <lb n="21073"/>
           <said who="Simon Dedalus">―Ay, bedad! And there's the Groceries sure enough! cried Mr <lb n="21074"/>
          Dedalus. You often heard me speak of the Groceries, didn't <lb n="21075"/>
          you, Stephen. Many's the time we went down there when our <lb n="21076"/>
          names had been marked, a crowd of us, Harry Peard and little <lb n="21077"/>
          Jack Mountain and Bob Dyas and Maurice Moriarty, the <lb n="21078"/>
          Frenchman, and Tom O'Grady and Mick Lacy that I told you <lb n="21079"/>
          of this morning and Joey Corbet and poor little goodhearted <lb n="21080"/>
          Johnny Keevers of the Tantiles. <lb n="21081"/></said> </p>
          <p>  The leaves of the trees along the Mardyke were astir and <lb n="21082"/>
          whispering in the sunlight. A team of cricketers passed, agile <lb n="21083"/>
          young men in flannels and blazers, one of them carrying the <lb n="21084"/>
          long green wicketbag. In a quiet bystreet a German band of five <lb n="21085"/>
          players in faded uniforms and with battered brass instruments <lb n="21086"/>
          was playing to an audience of street arabs and leisurely mess- <lb n="21087"/>
          enger boys. A maid in a white cap and apron was watering a <lb n="21088"/>
          box of plants on a sill which shone like a slab of limestone in <lb n="21089"/>
          the warm glare. From another window open to the air came the <lb n="21090"/>
          sound of a piano, scale after scale rising into the treble.<lb n="21091"/> </p>
          <p>  Stephen walked on at his father's side, listening to stories he <lb n="21092"/>
          had heard before, hearing again the names of the scattered and <lb n="21093"/>
          dead revellers who had been the companions of his father's <lb n="21094"/>
          youth. And a faint sickness sighed in his heart. He recalled his <lb n="21095"/>
          own equivocal position in Belvedere, a free boy, a leader afraid <lb n="21096"/>
          of his own authority, proud and sensitive and suspicious, bat- <lb n="21097"/>
          tling against the squalor of his life and against the riot of his <lb n="21098"/>
          mind. The letters cut in the stained wood of the desk stared <lb n="21099"/>
          upon him, mocking his bodily weakness and futile enthusiasms <lb n="21100"/>
          and making him loathe himself for his own mad and filthy <lb n="21101"/>
          orgies. The spittle in his throat grew bitter and foul to swallow <lb n="21102"/>
          and the faint sickness climbed to his brain so that for a moment <lb n="21103"/>
          he closed his eyes and walked on in darkness.<lb n="21104"/> </p>
          <p>  He could still hear his father's voice. <lb n="21105"/>
           <said who="Simon Dedalus">―When you kick out for yourself, Stephen, }omit{ (as I daresay you <lb n="21106"/>
          will one of those days) }omit{ remember, whatever you do, to mix <lb n="21107"/>
          with gentlemen. When I was a young fellow I tell you I enjoyed <lb n="21108"/>
          myself. I mixed with fine decent fellows. Everyone of us could <lb n="21109"/>
          do something. One fellow had a good voice, another fellow <lb n="21110"/>
          was a good actor, another could sing a good comic song, an- <lb n="21111"/>
          other was a good oarsman or a good racketplayer, another <lb n="21112"/>
          could tell a good story and so on. We kept the ball rolling <lb n="21113"/>
          anyhow and enjoyed ourselves and saw a bit of life and we <lb n="21114"/>
          were none the worse of it either. But we were all gentlemen, <lb n="21115"/>
          Stephen, (at least I hope we were) }omit{ and bloody good honest <lb n="21116"/>
          Irishmen too. That's the kind of fellows I want you to associate <lb n="21117"/>
          with, fellows of the right kidney. I'm talking to you as a friend, <lb n="21118"/>
          Stephen. I don't believe in playing the stern father. I don't <lb n="21119"/>
          believe a son should be afraid of his father. No, I treat you as <lb n="21120"/>
          your grandfather treated me when I was a young chap. We <lb n="21121"/>
          were more like brothers than father and son. I'll never forget <lb n="21122"/>
          the first day he caught me smoking. I was standing at the end <lb n="21123"/>
          of the South Terrace one day with some maneens like myself <lb n="21124"/>
          and sure we thought we were grand fellows because we had <lb n="21125"/>
          pipes stuck in the corners of our mouths. Suddenly the gov- <lb n="21126"/>
          ernor passed. He didn't say a word or stop even. But the next <lb n="21127"/>
          day, Sunday, we were out for a walk together and when we <lb n="21128"/>
          were coming home he took out his cigar case and said: <emph>By the <lb n="21129"/>
          bye, Simon, I didn't know you smoked:</emph> or something like that. <lb n="21130"/>
          – Of course I tried to carry it off as best I could. <emph>If you want a <lb n="21131"/>
          good smoke</emph>, he said, <emph>try one of these cigars. An American <lb n="21132"/>
          captain made me a present of them last night in Queenstown</emph>. <lb n="21133"/></said> </p>
          <p>  Stephen heard his father's voice break into a laugh which <lb n="21134"/>
          was almost a sob. <lb n="21135"/>
           <said who="Simon Dedalus">―He was the handsomest man in Cork at that time, by God he <lb n="21136"/>
          was! The women used to stand to look after him in the street. <lb n="21137"/></said> </p>
          <p>  He heard the sob passing loudly down his father's throat <lb n="21138"/>
          and opened his eyes with a nervous impulse. The sunlight <lb n="21139"/>
          breaking suddenly on his sight turned the sky and clouds into a <lb n="21140"/>
          fantastic world of sombre masses with lakelike spaces of dark <lb n="21141"/>
          rosy light. His very brain was sick and powerless. He could <lb n="21142"/>
          scarcely interpret the letters of the signboards of the shops. By <lb n="21143"/>
          his monstrous way of life he seemed to have put himself be- <lb n="21144"/>
          yond the limits of reality. Nothing moved him or spoke to him <lb n="21145"/>
          from the real world unless he heard in it an echo of the <lb n="21146"/>
          infuriated cries within him. He could respond to no earthly or <lb n="21147"/>
          human appeal, dumb and insensible to the call of summer and <lb n="21148"/>
          gladness and companionship, wearied and dejected by his fa- <lb n="21149"/>
          ther's voice. He could scarcely recognise as his his own <lb n="21150"/>
          thoughts, and repeated slowly to himself:<lb n="21151"/> </p>
          <p> ―I am Stephen Dedalus. I am walking beside my father whose <lb n="21152"/>
          name is Simon Dedalus. We are in Cork, in Ireland. Cork is a <lb n="21153"/>
          city. Our room is in the Victoria Hotel. Victoria and Stephen <lb n="21154"/>
          and Simon. Simon and Stephen and Victoria. Names.<lb n="21155"/> </p>
          <p>  The memory of his childhood suddenly grew dim. He tried <lb n="21156"/>
          to call forth some of its vivid moments but could not. He <lb n="21157"/>
          recalled only names: Dante, Parnell, Clane, <place><location><geo>53.310770, -6.684719</geo></location><placeName>Clongowes</placeName></place>. A little <lb n="21158"/>
          boy had been taught geography by an old woman who kept <lb n="21159"/>
          two brushes in her wardrobe. Then he had been sent away <lb n="21160"/>
          from home to a college. In the college he had made his first <lb n="21161"/>
          communion and eaten slim jim out of his cricket cap and <lb n="21162"/>
          watched the firelight leaping and dancing on the wall of a little <lb n="21163"/>
          bedroom in the infirmary and dreamed of being dead, of mass <lb n="21164"/>
          being said for him by the rector in a black and gold cope, of <lb n="21165"/>
          being buried then in the little graveyard of the community off <lb n="21166"/>
          the main avenue of limes. But he had not died then. Parnell had <lb n="21167"/>
          died. There had been no mass for the dead in the chapel and no <lb n="21168"/>
          procession. He had not died but he had faded out like a film in <lb n="21169"/>
          the sun. He had been lost or had wandered out of existence for <lb n="21170"/>
          he no longer existed. How strange to think of him passing out <lb n="21171"/>
          of existence in such a way, not by death but by fading out in <lb n="21172"/>
          the sun or by being lost and forgotten somewhere in the uni- <lb n="21173"/>
          verse! It was strange to see his small body appear again for a <lb n="21174"/>
          moment: a little boy in a grey belted suit. His hands were in his <lb n="21175"/>
          sidepockets and his trousers were tucked in at the  knees by <lb n="21176"/>
          elastic bands.<lb n="21177"/> </p>
          <p>  On the evening of the day on which the property was sold <lb n="21178"/>
          Stephen followed his father meekly about the city from bar to <lb n="21179"/>
          bar. To the sellers in the market, to the barmen and barmaids, <lb n="21180"/>
          to the beggars who importuned him for a lob Mr Dedalus told <lb n="21181"/>
          the same tale, that he was an old Corkonian, that he had been <lb n="21182"/>
          trying for thirty years to get rid of his Cork accent up in Dublin <lb n="21183"/>
          and that Peter Pickackafox beside him was his eldest son but <lb n="21184"/>
          that he was only a Dublin jackeen.<lb n="21185"/> </p>
          <p>  They had set out early in the morning from Newcombe's <lb n="21186"/>
          coffeehouse where Mr Dedalus' cup had rattled noisily against <lb n="21187"/>
          its saucer and Stephen had tried to cover that shameful sign of <lb n="21188"/>
          his father's drinkingbout of the night before by moving his <lb n="21189"/>
          chair and coughing. One humiliation had succeeded another: <lb n="21190"/>
          the false smiles of the market sellers, the curvettings and <lb n="21191"/>
          oglings of the barmaids with whom his father flirted, the com- <lb n="21192"/>
          pliments and encouraging words of his father's friends. They <lb n="21193"/>
          had told him that he had a great look of his grandfather and <lb n="21194"/>
          Mr Dedalus had agreed that he was an ugly likeness. They had <lb n="21195"/>
          unearthed traces of a Cork accent in his speech and made him <lb n="21196"/>
          admit that the Lee was a much finer river than the Liffey. One <lb n="21197"/>
          of them in order to put his Latin to the proof had made him <lb n="21198"/>
          translate short passages from Dilectus and asked him whether <lb n="21199"/>
          it was correct to say: <seg xml:lang="la">Tempora mutantur nos et mutamur in illis</seg> <lb n="21200"/>
          or <seg xml:lang="la">Tempora mutantur et nos mutamur in illis</seg>. Another, a brisk <lb n="21201"/>
          old man, whom Mr Dedalus called Johnny Cashman, had <lb n="21202"/>
          covered him with confusion by asking him to say which were <lb n="21203"/>
          prettier, the Dublin girls or the Cork girls. <lb n="21204"/>
           <said who="Simon Dedalus">―He's not that way built, said Mr Dedalus. Leave him alone. <lb n="21205"/>
          He's a levelheaded thinking boy who doesn't bother his head <lb n="21206"/>
          about that kind of nonsense. <lb n="21207"/> </said>
           <said who="little old man">―Then he's not his father's son, said the little old man. <lb n="21208"/> </said>
           <said who="Simon Dedalus">―I don't know, I'm sure, said Mr Dedalus, smiling com- <lb n="21209"/>
          placently.<lb n="21210"/> </said>
           <said who="little old man">―Your father, said the little old man to Stephen, was the <lb n="21211"/>
          boldest flirt in the city of Cork in his day. Do you know that? <lb n="21212"/></said> </p>
          <p>  Stephen looked down and studied the tiled floor of the bar <lb n="21213"/>
          into which they had drifted. <lb n="21214"/>
           <said who="Simon Dedalus">―Now don't be putting ideas into his head, said Mr Dedalus. <lb n="21215"/>
          Leave him to his Maker. <lb n="21216"/> </said>
           <said who="little old man">―Yerra, sure I wouldn't put any ideas into his head. I'm old <lb n="21217"/>
          enough to be his grandfather. And I am a grandfather, said the <lb n="21218"/>
          little old man to Stephen. Do you know that? <lb n="21219"/> </said>
           <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Are you? asked Stephen. <lb n="21220"/> </said>
           <said who="little old man">―Bedad I am, said the little old man. I have two bouncing <lb n="21221"/>
          grandchildren out at Sunday's Well. Now then! What age do <lb n="21222"/>
          you think I am? And I remember seeing your grandfather in his <lb n="21223"/>
          red coat riding out to hounds. That was before you were born. <lb n="21224"/> </said>
           <said who="Simon Dedalus">―Ay, or thought of, said Mr Dedalus. <lb n="21225"/> </said>
           <said who="little old man">―Bedad I did! repeated the little old man. And, more than <lb n="21226"/>
          that, I can remember even your greatgrandfather, old John Ste- <lb n="21227"/>
          phen Dedalus, and a fierce old fireeater he was. Now then! <lb n="21228"/>
          There's a memory for you! <lb n="21229"/> </said>
           <said who="another of the company">―That's three generations - four generations, said another of <lb n="21230"/>
          the company. Why, Johnny Cashman, you must be nearing the <lb n="21231"/>
          century.<lb n="21232"/> </said>
           <said who="little old man">―Well, I'll tell you the truth, said the little old man. I'm just <lb n="21233"/>
          twentyseven years of age. <lb n="21234"/> </said>
           <said who="Simon Dedalus">―We're as old as we feel, Johnny, said Mr Dedalus. And just <lb n="21235"/>
          finish what you have there and we'll have another. Here, Tim <lb n="21236"/>
          or Tom or whatever your name is, give us the same again here. <lb n="21237"/>
          By God, I don't feel more than eighteen myself. There's that <lb n="21238"/>
          son of mine there not half my age and I'm a better man than he <lb n="21239"/>
          is any day of the week. <lb n="21240"/> </said>
           <said who="another of the company">―Draw it mild now, Dedalus. I think it's about time for you to <lb n="21241"/>
          take a back seat, said the gentleman who had spoken before. <lb n="21242"/> </said>
           <said who="Simon Dedalus">―No, by God! asserted Mr Dedalus. I'll sing a tenor song <lb n="21243"/>
          against him or I'll vault a fivebarred gate against him or I'll run <lb n="21244"/>
          with him after the hounds across the country as I did thirty <lb n="21245"/>
          years ago along with the Kerry Boy and the best man for it. <lb n="21246"/> </said>
           <said who="little old man">―But he'll beat you here, said the little old man, tapping his <lb n="21247"/>
          forehead and raising his glass to drain it. <lb n="21248"/> </said>
           <said who="Simon Dedalus">―Well, I hope he'll be as good a man as his father. That's all I <lb n="21249"/>
          can say, said Mr Dedalus. <lb n="21250"/> </said>
           <said who="little old man">―If he is, he'll do, said the little old man. <lb n="21251"/> </said>
           <said who="Simon Dedalus">―And thanks be to God, Johnny, said Mr Dedalus, that we <lb n="21252"/>
          lived so long and did so little harm. <lb n="21253"/> </said>
           <said who="little old man">―But did so much good, Simon, said the little old man <lb n="21254"/>
          gravely. Thanks be to God we lived so long and did so much <lb n="21255"/>
          good.<lb n="21256"/></said> </p>
          <p>  Stephen watched the three glasses being raised from the <lb n="21257"/>
          counter as his father and his two cronies drank to the memory <lb n="21258"/>
          of their past. An abyss of fortune or of temperament sundered <lb n="21259"/>
          him from them. His mind seemed older than theirs: it shone <lb n="21260"/>
          coldly on their strifes and happiness and regrets like a moon <lb n="21261"/>
          upon a younger earth. No life or youth stirred in him as it had <lb n="21262"/>
          stirred in them. He had known neither the pleasure of compan- <lb n="21263"/>
          ionship with others nor the vigour of rude male health nor filial <lb n="21264"/>
          piety. Nothing stirred within his soul but a cold and cruel and <lb n="21265"/>
          loveless lust. His childhood was dead or lost and with it his <lb n="21266"/>
          soul capable of simple joys: and he was drifting amid life like <lb n="21267"/>
          the barren shell of the moon.<lb n="21268"/> </p>
          <lg>
             <l>Art thou pale for weariness </l> <lb n="21269"/>
             <l>Of climbing heaven and gazing on the earth </l> <lb n="21270"/>
             <l>Wandering companionless ....?</l> <lb n="21271"/>
          </lg>
          <p>  He repeated to himself the lines of Shelley's fragment. Its <lb n="21272"/>
          alternation of sad human ineffectiveness with vast inhuman <lb n="21273"/>
          cycles of activity chilled him: and he forgot his own human and <lb n="21274"/>
          ineffectual grieving.<lb n="21275"/> </p>

          <p>  Stephen's mother and his brother and one of his cousins <lb n="21276"/>
          waited at the corner of quiet Foster Place while he and his <lb n="21277"/>
          father went up the steps and along the colonnade where the <lb n="21278"/>
          highland sentry was parading. When they had passed into the <lb n="21279"/>
          great hall and stood at the counter Stephen drew forth his <lb n="21280"/>
          orders on the governor of the bank of Ireland for thirty and <lb n="21281"/>
          three pounds; and these sums, the moneys of his exhibition and <lb n="21282"/>
          essay prize, were paid over to him rapidly by the teller in notes <lb n="21283"/>
          and in coin respectively. He bestowed them in his pockets with <lb n="21284"/>
          feigned composure and suffered the friendly teller, to whom his <lb n="21285"/>
          father chatted, to take his hand across the broad counter and <lb n="21286"/>
          wish him a brilliant career in after life. He was impatient of <lb n="21287"/>
          their voices and could not keep his feet at rest. But the teller <lb n="21288"/>
          still deferred the serving of others to say that he was living in <lb n="21289"/>
          changed times and that there was nothing like giving a boy the <lb n="21290"/>
          best education that money could buy. Mr Dedalus lingered in <lb n="21291"/>
          the hall gazing about him and up at the roof and telling Ste- <lb n="21292"/>
          phen, who urged him to come out, that they were standing in <lb n="21293"/>
          the house of commons of the old Irish parliament. <lb n="21294"/>
           <said who="Simon Dedalus">―God help us! he said piously. To think of the men of those <lb n="21295"/>
          times, Stephen, Hely Hutchinson and Flood and Henry Grattan <lb n="21296"/>
          and Charles Kendal Bushe, and the noblemen we have now, <lb n="21297"/>
          leaders of the Irish people at home and abroad. Why, by God, <lb n="21298"/>
          they wouldn't be seen dead in a ten acre field with them. No, <lb n="21299"/>
          Stephen, old chap, I'm sorry to say that they are only as I roved <lb n="21300"/>
          out one fine May morning in the merry month of sweet July. <lb n="21301"/></said> </p>
          <p>  A keen October wind was blowing round the bank. The <lb n="21302"/>
          three figures standing at the edge of the muddy path had <lb n="21303"/>
          pinched cheeks and watery eyes. Stephen looked at his thinly <lb n="21304"/>
          clad mother and remembered that a few days before he had <lb n="21305"/>
          seen a mantle priced at twenty guineas in the window of Bar- <lb n="21306"/>
          nardo's. <lb n="21307"/>
           <said who="Simon Dedalus">―Well that's done, said Mr Dedalus. <lb n="21398"/> </said>
           <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―We had better go to dinner, said Stephen. Where? <lb n="21309"/> </said>
           <said who="Simon Dedalus">―Dinner? said Mr Dedalus. Well, I suppose we had better, <lb n="21310"/>
          what?<lb n="21311"/> </said>
           <said who="Mary Dedalus">―Some place that's not too dear, said Mrs Dedalus. <lb n="21312"/> </said>
           <said who="Simon Dedalus">―Underdone's?<lb n="21313"/> </said>
           <said who="Mary Dedalus">―Yes. Some quiet place. <lb n="21314"/> </said>
           <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Come along, said Stephen quickly. It doesn't matter about <lb n="21315"/>
          the dearness. <lb n="21316"/></said> </p>
          <p>  He walked on before them with short nervous steps, smiling. <lb n="21317"/>
          They tried to keep up with him, smiling also at his eagerness. <lb n="21318"/>
           <said who="Simon Dedalus">―Take it easy like a good young fellow, said his father. We're <lb n="21319"/>
          not out for the half mile, are we? <lb n="21320"/></said> </p>
          <p>  For a swift season of merrymaking the money of his prizes <lb n="21321"/>
          ran through Stephen's  fingers. Great parcels of groceries and <lb n="21322"/>
          delicacies and dried fruits arrived from the city. Every day he <lb n="21323"/>
          drew up a bill of fare for the family and every night led a party <lb n="21324"/>
          of three or four to the theatre to see <emph>Ingomar</emph> or <emph>The Lady of <lb n="21325"/>
          Lyons</emph>. In his coat pockets he carried squares of Vienna choc- <lb n="21326"/>
          olate for his guests while his trousers' pockets bulged with <lb n="21327"/>
          masses of silver and copper coins. He bought presents for <lb n="21328"/>
          everyone, overhauled his room, wrote out resolutions, marshal- <lb n="21329"/>
          led his books up and down their shelves, pored upon all kinds <lb n="21330"/>
          of price lists, drew up a form of commonwealth for the <lb n="21331"/>
          household by which every member of it held some office, <lb n="21332"/>
          opened a loan bank for his family and pressed loans on willing <lb n="21333"/>
          borrowers so that he might have the pleasure of making out <lb n="21334"/>
          receipts and reckoning the interests on the sums lent. When he <lb n="21335"/>
          could do no more he drove up and down the city in trams. <lb n="21336"/>
          Then the season of pleasure came to an end. The pot of pink <lb n="21337"/>
          enamel paint gave out and the wainscot of his bedroom re- <lb n="21338"/>
          mained with its unfinished and illplastered coat.<lb n="21339"/> </p>
          <p>  His household returned to its usual way of life. His mother <lb n="21340"/>
          had no further occasion to upbraid him for squandering his <lb n="21341"/>
          money. He too returned to his old life at school and all his <lb n="21342"/>
          novel enterprises fell to pieces. The commonwealth fell, the <lb n="21343"/>
          loan bank closed its coffers and its books on a sensible loss, the <lb n="21344"/>
          rules of life which he had drawn about himself fell into desue- <lb n="21345"/>
          tude.<lb n="21346"/> </p>
          <p>  How foolish his aim had been! He had tried to build a <lb n="21347"/>
          breakwater of order and elegance against the sordid tide of life <lb n="21348"/>
          without him and to dam up, by rules of conduct and active <lb n="21349"/>
          interests and new filial relations, the powerful recurrence of the <lb n="21350"/>
          tides within him. Useless. From without as from within the <lb n="21351"/>
          waters had flowed over his barriers: their tides began once <lb n="21352"/>
          more to jostle fiercely above the crumbled mole.<lb n="21353"/> </p>
          <p>  He saw clearly too his own futile isolation. He had not gone <lb n="21354"/>
          one step nearer the lives he had sought to approach nor bridged <lb n="21355"/>
          the restless shame and rancour that divided him from father <lb n="21356"/>
          and mother and brother and sister. He felt that he was hardly <lb n="21357"/>
          of the one blood with them but stood to them rather in the <lb n="21358"/>
          mystical kinship of fosterage, fosterchild and fosterbrother.<lb n="21359"/> </p>
          <p>  He burned to appease the fierce longings of his heart before <lb n="21360"/>
          which everything else was idle and alien. He cared little that he <lb n="21361"/>
          was in mortal sin, that his life had grown to be a tissue of <lb n="21362"/>
          subterfuges and falsehood. Beside the savage desire within him <lb n="21363"/>
          to realise the enormities which he brooded on nothing was <lb n="21364"/>
          sacred. He bore cynically with the shameful details of his secret <lb n="21365"/>
          riots in which he exulted to defile with patience whatever im- <lb n="21366"/>
          age had attracted his eyes. By day and by night he moved <lb n="21367"/>
          among distorted images of the outer world. A figure that had <lb n="21368"/>
          seemed to him by day demure and innocent  came towards him <lb n="21369"/>
          by night through the winding darkness of sleep, her face trans- <lb n="21370"/>
          figured by a lecherous cunning, her eyes bright with brutish <lb n="21371"/>
          joy. Only the morning pained him with its dim memory of dark <lb n="21372"/>
          orgiastic riot, its keen and humiliating sense of transgression.<lb n="21373"/> </p>
          <p>  He returned to his wanderings. The veiled autumnal even- <lb n="21374"/>
          ings led him from street to street as they had led him years <lb n="21375"/>
          before along the quiet avenues of Blackrock. But no vision of <lb n="21376"/>
          trim front gardens or of kindly lights in the windows poured a <lb n="21377"/>
          tender influence upon him now. Only at times, in the pauses of <lb n="21378"/>
          his desire, when the luxury that was wasting him gave room to <lb n="21379"/>
          a softer languor, the image of Mercedes traversed the back- <lb n="21380"/>
          ground of his memory. He saw again the small white house and <lb n="21381"/>
          the garden of rosebushes on the road that led to the mountains <lb n="21382"/>
          and he remembered the sadly proud gesture of refusal which he <lb n="21383"/>
          was to make there, standing with her in the moonlit garden <lb n="21384"/>
          after years of estrangement and adventure. At those moments <lb n="21385"/>
          the soft speeches of Claude Melnotte rose to his lips and eased <lb n="21386"/>
          his unrest. A tender premonition touched him of the tryst he <lb n="21387"/>
          had then looked forward to and, in spite of the horrible reality <lb n="21388"/>
          which lay between his hope of then and now, of the holy <lb n="21389"/>
          encounter he had then imagined at which weakness and timid- <lb n="21390"/>
          ity and inexperience were to fall from him.<lb n="21391"/> </p>
          <p>  Such moments passed and the wasting fires of lust sprang up <lb n="21392"/>
          again. The verses passed from his lips and the inarticulate cries <lb n="21393"/>
          and the unspoken brutal words rushed forth from his brain to <lb n="21394"/>
          force a passage. His blood was in revolt. He wandered up and <lb n="21395"/>
          down the dark slimy streets peering into the gloom of lanes and <lb n="21396"/>
          doorways, listening eagerly for any sound. He moaned to him- <lb n="21397"/>
          self like some baffled prowling beast. He wanted to sin with <lb n="21398"/>
          another of his kind, to force another being to sin with him and <lb n="21399"/>
          to exult with her in sin. He felt some dark presence moving <lb n="21400"/>
          irresistibly upon him from the  darkness, a presence subtle and <lb n="21401"/>
          murmurous as a flood filling him wholly with itself. Its mur- <lb n="21402"/>
          mur besieged his ears like the murmur of some multitude in <lb n="21403"/>
          sleep; its subtle streams penetrated his being. His hands <lb n="21404"/>
          clenched convulsively and his teeth set together as he suffered <lb n="21405"/>
          the agony of its penetration. He stretched out his arms in the <lb n="21406"/>
          street to hold fast the frail swooning form that eluded him and <lb n="21407"/>
          incited him: and the cry that he had strangled for so long in his <lb n="21408"/>
          throat issued from his lips. It broke from him like a wail of <lb n="21409"/>
          despair from a hell of sufferers and died in a wail of furious <lb n="21410"/>
          entreaty, a cry for an iniquitous abandonment, a cry which was <lb n="21411"/>
          but the echo of an obscene scrawl which he had read on the <lb n="21412"/>
          oozing wall of a urinal.<lb n="21413"/> </p>
          <p>  He had wandered into a maze of narrow and dirty streets. <lb n="21414"/>
          From the foul laneways he heard bursts of hoarse riot and <lb n="21415"/>
          wrangling and the drawling of drunken singers. He walked <lb n="21416"/>
          onward, undismayed, wondering whether he had strayed into <lb n="21417"/>
          the quarter of the jews. Women and girls dressed in long vivid <lb n="21418"/>
          gowns traversed the street from house to house. They were <lb n="21419"/>
          leisurely and perfumed. A trembling seized him and his eyes <lb n="21420"/>
          grew dim. The yellow gasflames arose before his troubled vi- <lb n="21421"/>
          sion against the vapoury sky, burning as if before an altar. <lb n="21422"/>
          Before the doors and in the lighted halls groups were gathered, <lb n="21423"/>
          arrayed as for some rite. He was in another world: he had <lb n="21424"/>
          awakened from a slumber of centuries.<lb n="21425"/> </p>
          <p>  He stood still in the middle of the roadway, his heart clam- <lb n="21426"/>
          ouring against his bosom in a tumult. A young woman dressed <lb n="21427"/>
          in a long pink gown laid her hand on his arm to detain him and <lb n="21428"/>
          gazed into his face. She said gaily: <lb n="21429"/>
           <said who="prostitute">―Good night, Willie dear! <lb n="21430"/></said> </p>
          <p>  Her room was warm and lightsome. A huge doll sat with her <lb n="21431"/>
          legs apart in the copious easychair beside the bed. He tried to <lb n="21432"/>
          bid his tongue speak that he might seem at ease, watching her <lb n="21433"/>
          as she undid her gown, noting the proud conscious movements <lb n="21434"/>
          of her perfumed head.<lb n="21435"/> </p>
          <p>  As he stood silent in the middle of the room she came over <lb n="21436"/>
          to him and embraced him gaily and gravely. Her round arms <lb n="21437"/>
          held him firmly to her and he, seeing her face lifted to him in <lb n="21438"/>
          serious calm and feeling the warm calm rise and fall of her <lb n="21439"/>
          breast, all but burst into hysterical weeping. Tears of joy and <lb n="21440"/>
          relief shone in his delighted eyes and his lips parted though they <lb n="21441"/>
          would not speak.<lb n="21442"/> </p>
          <p>  She passed her tinkling hand through his hair, calling him a <lb n="21443"/>
          little rascal. <lb n="21444"/>
           <said who="prostitute">―Give me a kiss, she said. <lb n="21445"/></said> </p>
          <p>  His lips would not bend to kiss her. He wanted to be held <lb n="21446"/>
          firmly in her arms, to be caressed slowly, slowly, slowly. In her <lb n="21447"/>
          arms he felt that he had suddenly become strong and fearless <lb n="21448"/>
          and sure of himself. But his lips would not bend to kiss her.<lb n="21449"/> </p>
          <p>  With a sudden movement she bowed his head and joined her <lb n="21450"/>
          lips to his and he read the meaning of her movements in her <lb n="21451"/>
          frank uplifted eyes. It was too much for him. He closed his <lb n="21452"/>
          eyes, surrendering himself to her, body and mind, conscious of <lb n="21453"/>
          nothing in the world but the dark pressure of her softly parting <lb n="21454"/>
          lips. They pressed upon his brain as upon his lips as though <lb n="21455"/>
          they were the vehicle of a vague speech; and between them he <lb n="21456"/>
          felt an unknown and timid pressure, darker than the swoon of <lb n="21457"/>
          sin, softer than sound or odour.<lb n="21458"/> </p>

          <p> The swift December dusk had come tumbling clownishly after <lb n="30001"/>
          its dull day and as he stared through the dull square of the <lb n="30002"/>
          window of the schoolroom he felt his belly crave for its food. <lb n="30003"/>
          He hoped there would be stew for dinner, turnips and carrots <lb n="30004"/>
          and bruised potatoes and fat mutton pieces to be ladled out in <lb n="30005"/>
          thick peppered flourfattened sauce. Stuff it into you, his belly <lb n="30006"/>
          counselled him.<lb n="30007"/> </p>
          <p> It would be a gloomy secret night. After early nightfall the <lb n="30008"/>
          yellow lamps would light up here and there the squalid quarter <lb n="30009"/>
          of the brothels. He would follow a devious course up and down <lb n="30010"/>
          the streets, circling always nearer and nearer in a tremor of fear <lb n="30011"/>
          and joy, until his feet led him suddenly round a dark corner. <lb n="30012"/>
          The whores would be just coming out of their houses making <lb n="30013"/>
          ready for the night, yawning lazily after their sleep and settling <lb n="30014"/>
          the hairpins in their clusters of hair. He would pass by them <lb n="30015"/>
          calmly waiting for a sudden movement of his own will or a <lb n="30016"/>
          sudden call to his sinloving soul from their soft perfumed flesh. <lb n="30017"/>
          Yet as he prowled in quest of that call his senses, stultified only <lb n="30018"/>
          by his desire, would note keenly all that wounded and shamed <lb n="30019"/>
          them, his eyes a ring of porter froth on a clothless table or a <lb n="30020"/>
          photograph of two soldiers standing to attention or a gaudy <lb n="30021"/>
          playbill, his ears the drawling jargon of greeting: <lb n="30022"/>
           <said who="a whore">―Hello, Bertie, any good in your mind?<lb n="30023"/> </said>
           <said who="a whore">―Is that you, pigeon?<lb n="30024"/> </said>
           <said who="a whore">―Number ten. Fresh Nelly is waiting on you.<lb n="30025"/> </said>
           <said who="a whore">―Goodnight, husband! Coming in to have a short time?<lb n="30026"/></said> </p>
          <p> The equation on the page of his scribbler began to spread <lb n="30027"/>
          out a widening tail, eyed and starred like a peacock's: and <lb n="30028"/>
          when the eyes and stars of its indices had been eliminated be- <lb n="30029"/>
          gan slowly to fold itself together again. The indices appearing <lb n="30030"/>
          and disappearing were eyes opening and closing; the eyes <lb n="30031"/>
          opening and closing were stars being born and being quenched. <lb n="30032"/>
          The vast cycle of starry life bore his weary  mind outward to its <lb n="30033"/>
          verge and inward to its centre, a distant music accompanying <lb n="30034"/>
          him outward and inward. What music? The music came nearer <lb n="30035"/>
          and he recalled the words, the words of Shelley's fragment <lb n="30036"/>
          upon the moon wandering companionless, pale for weariness. <lb n="30037"/>
          The stars began to crumble and a cloud of fine stardust fell <lb n="30038"/>
          through space.<lb n="30039"/> </p>
          <p> The dull light fell more faintly upon the page whereon an- <lb n="30040"/>
          other equation began to unfold itself slowly and to spread <lb n="30041"/>
          abroad its widening tail. It was his own soul going forth to <lb n="30042"/>
          experience, unfolding itself sin by sin, spreading abroad the <lb n="30043"/>
          balefire of its burning stars and folding back upon itself, fading <lb n="30044"/>
          slowly, quenching its own lights and fires. They were <lb n="30045"/>
          quenched: and the cold darkness filled chaos.<lb n="30046"/> </p>
          <p> A cold lucid indifference reigned in his soul. At his first <lb n="30047"/>
          violent sin he had felt a wave of vitality pass out of him and <lb n="30048"/>
          had feared to find his body or his soul maimed by the excess. <lb n="30049"/>
          Instead the vital wave had carried him on its bosom out of <lb n="30050"/>
          himself and back again when it receded: and no part of body or <lb n="30051"/>
          soul had been maimed but a dark peace had been established <lb n="30052"/>
          between them. The chaos in which his ardour extinguished <lb n="30053"/>
          itself was a cold indifferent knowledge of himself. He had <lb n="30054"/>
          sinned mortally not once but many times and he knew that, <lb n="30055"/>
          while he stood in danger of eternal damnation for the first sin <lb n="30056"/>
          alone, by every succeeding sin he multiplied his guilt and his <lb n="30057"/>
          punishment. His days and works and thoughts could make no <lb n="30058"/>
          atonement for him, the fountains of sanctifying grace having <lb n="30059"/>
          ceased to refresh his soul. At most by an alms given to a <lb n="30060"/>
          beggar, whose blessing he fled from, he might hope wearily to <lb n="30061"/>
          win for himself some measure of actual grace. Devotion had <lb n="30062"/>
          gone by the board. What did it avail to pray when he knew that <lb n="30063"/>
          his soul lusted after its own destruction? A certain pride, a <lb n="30064"/>
          certain awe, withheld him from offering to God even one <lb n="30065"/>
          prayer at night though he knew it was in God's power to take <lb n="30066"/>
          away his life while he slept and hurl his soul hellward ere he <lb n="30067"/>
          could beg for mercy. His pride in his own sin, his loveless awe <lb n="30068"/>
          of God told him that his offence was too grievous to be atoned <lb n="30069"/>
          for in whole or in part by a false homage to the Allseeing and <lb n="30070"/>
          Allknowing. <said who="a voice">―Well now, Ennis, I declare you have a head and so has my <lb n="30071"/>
          stick! Do you mean to say that you are not able to tell me what <lb n="30073"/>
          a surd is?<lb n="30074"/></said> </p>
          <p> The blundering answer stirred the embers of his contempt of <lb n="30075"/>
          his fellows. Towards others he felt neither shame nor fear. On <lb n="30076"/>
          Sunday mornings as he passed the churchdoor he glanced <lb n="30077"/>
          coldly at the worshippers who stood bareheaded, four deep, <lb n="30078"/>
          outside the church, morally present at the mass which they <lb n="30079"/>
          could neither see nor hear. Their dull piety and the sickly smell <lb n="30080"/>
          of the cheap hairoil with which they had anointed their heads <lb n="30081"/>
          repelled him from the altar they prayed at. He stooped to the <lb n="30082"/>
          evil of hypocrisy with others, sceptical of their innocence which <lb n="30083"/>
          he could cajole so easily.<lb n="30084"/> </p>
          <p> On the wall of his bedroom hung an illuminated scroll, the <lb n="30085"/>
          certificate of his prefecture in the college of the sodality of the <lb n="30086"/>
          Blessed Virgin Mary. On Saturday mornings when the sodality <lb n="30087"/>
          met in the chapel to recite the little office his place was a <lb n="30088"/>
          cushioned kneelingdesk at the right of the altar from which he <lb n="30089"/>
          led his wing of boys through the responses. The falsehood of <lb n="30090"/>
          his position did not pain him. If at moments he felt an impulse <lb n="30091"/>
          to rise from his post of honour and, confessing before them all <lb n="30092"/>
          his unworthiness, to leave the chapel, a glance at their faces <lb n="30093"/>
          restrained him. The imagery of the psalms of prophecy soothed <lb n="30094"/>
          his barren pride. The glories of Mary held his soul captive: <lb n="30095"/>
          spikenard and myrrh and frankincense, symbolising the <lb n="30096"/>
          preciousness of God's gifts to her soul, rich garments, symbol- <lb n="30097"/>
          ising her royal lineage, her emblems, the lateflowering plant <lb n="30098"/>
          and lateblossoming tree, symbolising the agelong gradual <lb n="30099"/>
          growth of her cultus among men. When it fell to him to read <lb n="30100"/>
          the lesson towards the close of the office he read it in a veiled <lb n="30101"/>
          voice, lulling his conscience to its music:<lb n="30102"/> </p>
          <lg>
            <p> <emph>Quasi cedrus exaltata sum in Libanon et quasi cu- <lb n="30103"/>
            pressus in  monte Sion. Quasi palma exaltata sum in <lb n="30104"/>
            Gades et quasi  plantatio rosae in Jericho. Quasi uliva <lb n="30105"/>
            speciosa in campis et  quasi platanus exaltata sum juxta <lb n="30106"/>
            aquam in plateis. Sicut  cinnamomum et balsamum aro- <lb n="30107"/>
            matizans odorem dedi et quasi  myrrha electa dedi <lb n="30108"/>
            suavitatem odoris.</emph><lb n="30109"/> </p>
          </lg>
          <p> His sin, which had covered him from the sight of God, had <lb n="30110"/>
          led him nearer to the refuge of sinners. Her eyes seemed to <lb n="30111"/>
          regard him with mild pity; her holiness, a strange light glowing <lb n="30112"/>
          faintly upon her frail flesh, did not humiliate the sinner who <lb n="30113"/>
          approached her. If ever he was impelled to cast sin from him <lb n="30114"/>
          and to repent the impulse that moved him was the wish to be <lb n="30115"/>
          her knight. If ever his soul, reentering her dwelling shyly after <lb n="30116"/>
          the frenzy of his body's lust had spent itself, was turned to- <lb n="30117"/>
          wards her whose emblem is the morning star, <emph>bright and</emph> <lb n="30118"/>
          <emph>musical, telling of heaven and infusing peace</emph>, it was when her <lb n="30119"/>
          names were murmured softly by lips whereon there still lin- <lb n="30120"/>
          gered foul and shameful words, the savour itself of a lewd kiss.<lb n="30121"/> </p>
          <p> That was strange. He tried to think how it could be but the <lb n="30122"/>
          dusk, deepening in the schoolroom, covered over his thought. <lb n="30123"/>
          The bell rang. The master marked the sums and cuts to be done <lb n="30124"/>
          for the next lesson and went out. Heron, beside Stephen, began <lb n="30125"/>
          to hum tunelessly:<lb n="30126"/> </p>
          <p> <emph>My excellent friend Bombados.</emph> <lb n="30127"/>
          <p> Ennis, who had gone to the yard, came back, saying: <lb n="30128"/>
           <said who="Ennis">―The boy from the house is coming up for the rector.<lb n="30129"/></said> </p>
          A tall boy behind Stephen rubbed his hands and said: <lb n="30130"/>
           <said who="a tall boy">―That's game ball. We can scut the whole hour. He won't be <lb n="30131"/>
          in till after half two. Then you can ask him questions on the <lb n="30132"/>
          catechism, Dedalus.<lb n="30133"/></said> </p>
          <p> Stephen, leaning back and drawing idly on his scribbler, <lb n="30134"/>
          listened to the talk about him which Heron checked from time <lb n="30135"/>
          to time by saying: <lb n="30136"/>
           <said who="Vincent Heron">―Shut up, will you. Don't make such a bally racket!<lb n="30137"/></said> </p>
          <p>It was strange too that he found an arid pleasure in follow- <lb n="30138"/>
          ing up to the end the rigid lines of the doctrines of the church <lb n="30139"/>
          and penetrating into obscure silences  only to hear and feel the <lb n="30140"/>
          more deeply his own condemnation. The sentence of saint <lb n="30141"/>
          James which says that he who offends against one command- <lb n="30142"/>
          ment becomes guilty of all had seemed to him first a swollen <lb n="30143"/>
          phrase until he had begun to grope in the darkness of his own <lb n="30144"/>
          state. From the evil seed of lust all other deadly sins had sprung <lb n="30145"/>
          forth: pride in himself and contempt of others, covetousness in <lb n="30146"/>
          using money for the purchase of unlawful pleasure, envy of <lb n="30147"/>
          those whose vices he could not reach to and calumnious <lb n="30148"/>
          murmuring against the pious, gluttonous  enjoyment of food, <lb n="30149"/>
          the dull glowering anger amid which he brooded upon his <lb n="30150"/>
          longing, the swamp of spiritual and bodily sloth in which his <lb n="30151"/>
          whole being had sunk.<lb n="30152"/> </p>
          <p> As he sat in his bench gazing calmly at the rector's shrewd <lb n="30153"/>
          harsh face his mind wound itself in and out of the curious <lb n="30154"/>
          questions proposed to it. If a man had stolen a pound in his <lb n="30155"/>
          youth and had used that pound to amass a huge fortune how <lb n="30156"/>
          much was he obliged to give back, the pound he had stolen <lb n="30157"/>
          only or the pound together with the compound interest accru- <lb n="30158"/>
          ing upon it or all his huge fortune? If a layman in giving <lb n="30159"/>
          baptism pour the water before saying the words is the child <lb n="30160"/>
          baptised? Is baptism with a mineral water valid? How comes it <lb n="30161"/>
          that while the first beatitude promises the kingdom of heaven <lb n="30162"/>
          to the poor of heart the second beatitude promises also to the <lb n="30163"/>
          meek that they shall possess the land? Why was the sacrament <lb n="30164"/>
          of the eucharist instituted under the two species of bread and <lb n="30165"/>
          wine if Jesus Christ be present body and blood, soul and divin- <lb n="30166"/>
          ity, in the bread alone and in the wine alone? Does a tiny <lb n="30167"/>
          particle of the consecrated bread contain all the body and <lb n="30168"/>
          blood of Jesus Christ or a part only of the body and blood? If <lb n="30169"/>
          the wine change into vinegar and the host crumble  into cor- <lb n="30170"/>
          ruption after they have been consecrated is Jesus Christ still <lb n="30171"/>

           <said who="a boy">―Here he is! Here he is!<lb n="30173"/></said> </p>
          <p> A boy from his post at the window had seen the rector come <lb n="30174"/>
          from the house. All the catechisms were opened and all heads <lb n="30175"/>
          bent upon them silently. The rector entered and took his seat <lb n="30176"/>
          on the dais. A gentle kick from the tall boy in the bench behind <lb n="30177"/>
          urged Stephen to ask a difficult question.<lb n="30178"/> </p>
          <p> The rector did not ask for a catechism to hear the lesson <lb n="30179"/>
          from. He clasped his hands on the desk and said: <lb n="30180"/>
           <said who="Father Conmee">―The retreat will begin on Wednesday afternoon in honour of <lb n="30181"/>
          saint Francis Xavier whose feast day is Saturday. The retreat <lb n="30182"/>
          will go on from Wednesday to Friday. On Friday confessions <lb n="30183"/>
          will be heard all the afternoon after beads. If any boys have <lb n="30184"/>
          special confessors perhaps it will be better for them not to <lb n="30185"/>
          change. Mass will be on Saturday morning at nine o'clock and <lb n="30186"/>
          general communion for the whole college. Saturday will be a <lb n="30187"/>
          free day. Sunday of course. But Saturday and Sunday being free <lb n="30188"/>
          days some boys might be inclined to think that Monday is a <lb n="30189"/>
          free day also. Beware of making that mistake. I think you, <lb n="30190"/>
          Lawless, are likely to make that mistake.<lb n="30191"/> </said>
           <said who="Lawless">―I, sir? Why,  sir?<lb n="30192"/></said> </p>
          <p> A little wave of quiet mirth broke forth over the class of <lb n="30193"/>
          boys from the rector's grim smile. Stephen's heart began slowly <lb n="30194"/>
          to fold and fade with fear like a withering flower.<lb n="30195"/> </p>
          <p> The rector went on gravely: <lb n="30196"/>
           <said who="Father Conmee">―You are all familiar with the story of the life of saint Francis <lb n="30197"/>
          Xavier, I suppose, the patron of your college. He came of an <lb n="30198"/>
          old and illustrious Spanish family and you remember that he <lb n="30199"/>
          was one of the first followers of saint Ignatius. They met in <place><location><geo>48.853157 2.343094</geo></location> <lb n="30200"/>
          <placeName>Paris</placeName></place> where Francis Xavier was professor of philosophy at the <lb n="30201"/>
          university. This young and brilliant nobleman and man of let- <lb n="30202"/>
          ters entered heart and soul into the ideas of our glorious <lb n="30203"/>
          founder and you know that he, at his own desire, was sent by <lb n="30204"/>
          saint Ignatius to preach to the Indians. He is called, as you <lb n="30205"/>
          know, the apostle of the Indies. He went from country to <lb n="30206"/>
          country in the east, from Africa to India, from India to Japan, <lb n="30207"/>
          baptising the people. He is said to have baptised as many as ten <lb n="30208"/>
          thousand idolaters in one month. It is said that his right arm <lb n="30209"/>
          had grown powerless from having been raised so often over the <lb n="30210"/>
          heads of those whom he baptised. He wished then to go to <lb n="30211"/>
          China to win still more souls for God but he died of fever on <lb n="30212"/>
          the <place><location><geo>21.705010 112.791206</geo></location><placeName>island of Sancian</placeName></place>. A great saint, saint Francis Xavier! A <lb n="30213"/>
          great soldier of God!<lb n="30214"/></said> </p>
          <p> The rector paused and then, shaking his clasped hands be- <lb n="30215"/>
          fore him, went on: <lb n="30216"/>
           <said who="Father Conmee">―He had the faith in him that moves mountains. Ten thou- <lb n="30217"/>
          sand souls won for God in a single month! That is a true <lb n="30218"/>
          conqueror, true to the motto of our order <seg xml:lang="la">ad majorem Dei <lb n="30219"/>
          gloriam</seg>! A saint who has great power in heaven, remember: <lb n="30220"/>
          power to intercede for us in our grief, power to obtain what- <lb n="30221"/>
          ever we pray for if it be for the good of our souls, power above <lb n="30222"/>
          all to obtain for us the grace to repent if we be in sin. A great <lb n="30223"/>
          saint, saint Francis Xavier! A great fisher of souls!<lb n="30224"/></said> </p>
          <p> He ceased to shake his clasped hands and, resting them <lb n="30225"/>
          against his forehead, looked right and left of them keenly at his <lb n="30226"/>
          listeners out of his dark stern eyes.<lb n="30227"/> </p>
          <p> In the silence their dark fire kindled the dusk into a tawny <lb n="30228"/>
          glow. Stephen's heart had withered up like a flower of the <lb n="30229"/>
          desert that feels the simoom  coming from afar.<lb n="30230"/> </p>

            broken with rheum. The figure of his old master, so strangely <lb n="30239"/>

            of saints, the apostle of the Indies, the patron saint also of your <lb n="30250"/>

            Even in the last few years what changes can most of you not <lb n="30256"/>

            bringing with them changes for good and bad, the memory of <lb n="30263"/>
            the great saint is honoured by the boys of his college who make <lb n="30264"/>

            while from the cares of our life, the cares of this workaday <lb n="30273"/>
            world, in order to examine the state of our conscience, to <lb n="30274"/>
            reflect on the mysteries of holy religion and to understand <lb n="30275"/>
            better why we are here in this world. During these few days I <lb n="30276"/>
            intend to put before you some thoughts concerning the four <lb n="30277"/>
            last things. They are, as you know from your catechism, death, <lb n="30278"/>
            judgment, hell and heaven. We shall try to understand them <lb n="30279"/>
            fully during these few days so that we may derive from the <lb n="30280"/>
            understanding of them a lasting benefit to our souls. And re- <lb n="30281"/>
            member, my dear boys, that we have been sent into this world <lb n="30282"/>
            for one thing and for one thing alone: to do God's holy will <lb n="30283"/>
            and to save our immortal souls. All else is worthless. One thing <lb n="30284"/>
            alone is needful, the salvation of one's soul. What doth it profit <lb n="30285"/>
            a man to gain the whole world if he suffer the loss of his <lb n="30286"/>
            immortal soul? Ah, my dear boys, believe me there is nothing in <lb n="30287"/>
            this wretched world that can make up for such a loss.<lb n="30288"/> </said>
             <said who="Father Arnall">―I will ask you therefore, my dear boys, to put away from <lb n="30289"/>
            your minds during these few days all worldly thoughts, <lb n="30290"/>
            whether of study or pleasure or ambition, and to give all your <lb n="30291"/>
            attention to the state of your souls. I need hardly remind you <lb n="30292"/>
            that during the days of the retreat all boys are expected to <lb n="30293"/>
            preserve a quiet and pious demeanour and to shun all loud <lb n="30294"/>
            unseemly pleasure. The elder boys, of course, will see that this <lb n="30295"/>
            custom is not infringed and I look especially to the prefects and <lb n="30296"/>
            officers of the sodality of Our Blessed Lady and of the sodality <lb n="30297"/>
            of the holy angels to set a good example to their fellowstu- <lb n="30298"/>

            Francis with our whole heart and our whole mind. God's bless- <lb n="30301"/>
            ing will then be upon all your year's studies. But, above and <lb n="30302"/>
            beyond all, let this retreat be one to which you can look back in <lb n="30303"/>
            after years when maybe you are far from this college and <lb n="30304"/>
            among very different surroundings, to which you can look back <lb n="30305"/>
            with joy and thankfulness and give thanks to God for having <lb n="30306"/>
            granted you this occasion of laying the first foundation of a <lb n="30307"/>
            pious honourable zealous christian life. And if, as may so <lb n="30308"/>
            happen, there be at this moment in these benches any poor soul <lb n="30309"/>
            which has had the unutterable misfortune to lose God's holy <lb n="30310"/>
            grace and to fall into grievous sin I fervently trust and pray that <lb n="30311"/>
            this retreat may be the turningpoint in the life of that soul. I <lb n="30312"/>
            pray to God  through the merits of His zealous servant Francis <lb n="30313"/>
            Xavier that such a soul may be led to sincere repentance and <lb n="30314"/>
            that the holy communion on saint Francis' day of this year may <lb n="30315"/>
            be a lasting covenant between God and that soul. For just and <lb n="30316"/>
            unjust, for saint and sinner alike, may this retreat be a mem- <lb n="30317"/>
            orable one.<lb n="30318"/> </said>
             <said who="Father Arnall">―Help me, my dear little brothers in Christ. Help me by your <lb n="30319"/>
            pious attention, by your own devotion, by your outward de- <lb n="30320"/>
            meanour. Banish from your minds all worldly thoughts and <lb n="30321"/>
            think only of the last things, death, judgment, hell and heaven. <lb n="30322"/>
            He who remembers these things, says Ecclesiastes, shall not sin <lb n="30323"/>
            for ever. He who remembers the last things will act and think <lb n="30324"/>
            with them always before his eyes. He will live a good life and <lb n="30325"/>
            die a good death, believing and knowing that, if he has sacri- <lb n="30326"/>
            ficed much in this earthly life, it will be given to him a <lb n="30327"/>
            hundredfold and a thousandfold more in the life to come, in the <lb n="30328"/>
            kingdom without end – a blessing, my dear boys, which I wish <lb n="30329"/>
            you from my heart; one and all, in the name of the Father and <lb n="30330"/>
            of the Son and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.<lb n="30331"/></said> </p>
            <p> As he walked home with silent companions a thick fog <lb n="30332"/>
            seemed to compass his mind. He waited in stupor of mind till it <lb n="30333"/>
            should lift and reveal what it had hidden. He ate his dinner <lb n="30334"/>
            with surly appetite and, when the meal was over and the <lb n="30335"/>
            greasestrewn plates lay abandoned on the table, he rose and <lb n="30336"/>
            went to the window, clearing the thick scum from his mouth <lb n="30337"/>
            with his tongue and licking it from his lips. So he had sunk to <lb n="30338"/>
            the state of a beast that licks his chaps after meat. This was the <lb n="30339"/>
            end: and a faint glimmer of fear began to pierce the fog of his <lb n="30340"/>
            mind. He pressed his face against the pane of the window and <lb n="30341"/>
            gazed out into the darkening street. Forms passed this way and <lb n="30342"/>
            that way through the dull light. And that was life. The letters <lb n="30343"/>
            of the name of Dublin lay heavily upon his mind, pushing one <lb n="30344"/>
            another surlily hither and thither with slow boorish insistence. <lb n="30345"/>
            His soul was fattening and congealing into a gross grease, <lb n="30346"/>
            plunging ever deeper in its dull fear into a sombre threatening <lb n="30347"/>
            dusk, while the body that was his stood, listless and dishon- <lb n="30348"/>
            oured, gazing out of darkened eyes, helpless, perturbed and <lb n="30349"/>
            human for a bovine god to stare upon.<lb n="30350"/> </p>
            <p> The next day brought death and judgment, stirring his soul <lb n="30351"/>
            slowly from its listless despair. The faint glimmer of fear be- <lb n="30352"/>
            came a terror of spirit as the hoarse voice of the preacher blew <lb n="30353"/>
            death into his soul. He suffered its agony. He felt the deathchill <lb n="30354"/>
            touch the extremities and creep onward towards the heart, the <lb n="30355"/>
            film of death veiling the eyes, the bright centres of the brain <lb n="30356"/>
            extinguished one by one like lamps, the last sweat oozing upon <lb n="30357"/>
            the skin, the powerlessness of the dying limbs, the speech <lb n="30358"/>
            thickening and wandering and failing, the heart throbbing <lb n="30359"/>
            faintly and more faintly, all but vanquished, the breath, the <lb n="30360"/>
            poor timid breath, the poor helpless human spirit, sobbing and <lb n="30361"/>
            sighing, gurgling  and rattling in the throat. No help! No help! <lb n="30362"/>
            He, he himself, his body to which he had yielded was dying. <lb n="30363"/>
            Into the grave with it! Nail it down into a wooden box, the <lb n="30364"/>
            corpse. Carry it out of the house on the shoulders of hirelings. <lb n="30365"/>
            Thrust it out of men's sight into a long hole in the ground, into <lb n="30366"/>
            the grave, to rot, to feed the mass of its creeping worms and to <lb n="30367"/>
            be devoured by scuttling plumpbellied rats.<lb n="30368"/> </p>
            <p> And while the friends were still standing in tears by the <lb n="30369"/>
            bedside the soul of the sinner was judged. At the last moment <lb n="30370"/>
            of consciousness the whole earthly life passed before the vision <lb n="30371"/>
            of the soul and, ere it had time to reflect, the body had died and <lb n="30372"/>
            the soul stood terrified before the judgmentseat. God, who had <lb n="30373"/>
            long been merciful, would then be just. He had long been <lb n="30374"/>
            patient, pleading with the sinful soul, giving it time to repent, <lb n="30375"/>
            sparing it yet awhile. But that time had gone. Time was to sin <lb n="30376"/>
            and to enjoy, time was to scoff at God and at  the warnings of <lb n="30377"/>
            His holy church, time was to defy His majesty, to disobey His <lb n="30378"/>
            commands, to hoodwink one's fellow men, to commit sin after <lb n="30379"/>
            sin and sin after sin and to hide one's corruption from the sight <lb n="30380"/>
            of men. But that time was over. Now it was God's turn: and He <lb n="30381"/>
            was not to be hoodwinked or deceived. Every sin would then <lb n="30382"/>
            come forth from its lurkingplace, the most rebellious against <lb n="30383"/>
            the divine will and the most degrading to our poor corrupt <lb n="30384"/>
            nature, the tiniest imperfection and the most heinous atrocity. <lb n="30385"/>
            What did it avail then to have been a great emperor, a great <lb n="30386"/>
            general, a marvellous inventor, the most learned of the learned? <lb n="30387"/>
            All were as one before the judgmentseat of God. He would <lb n="30388"/>
            reward the good and punish the wicked. One single instant was <lb n="30389"/>
            enough for the trial of a man's soul. One single instant after the <lb n="30390"/>
            body's death, the soul had been weighed in the balance. The <lb n="30391"/>
            particular judgment was over and the soul had passed to the <lb n="30392"/>
            abode of bliss or to the prison of purgatory or had been hurled <lb n="30393"/>
            howling into hell.<lb n="30394"/> </p>
            <p> Nor was that all. God's justice had still to be vindicated <lb n="30395"/>
            before men: after the particular there still remained the general <lb n="30396"/>
            judgment. The last day had come. The doomsday was at hand. <lb n="30397"/>
            The stars of heaven were falling upon the earth like the figs <lb n="30398"/>
            cast by the figtree which the wind has shaken. The sun, the <lb n="30399"/>
            great luminary of the universe, had become as sackcloth of <lb n="30400"/>
            hair. The moon was bloodred. The firmament was as a scroll <lb n="30401"/>
            rolled away. The archangel Michael, the prince of the heavenly <lb n="30402"/>
            host, appeared glorious and terrible against the sky. With one <lb n="30403"/>
            foot on the sea and one foot on the land he blew from the <lb n="30404"/>
            archangelical trumpet the brazen death of time. The three <lb n="30405"/>
            blasts of the angel filled all the universe. Time is, time was but <lb n="30406"/>
            time shall be no more. At the last blast the souls of universal <lb n="30407"/>
            humanity throng towards the valley of Jehoshaphat, rich and <lb n="30408"/>
            poor, gentle and simple, wise and foolish, good and wicked. <lb n="30409"/>
            The soul of every human being that has ever existed, the souls <lb n="30410"/>
            of all those who shall yet be born, all the sons and daughters of <lb n="30411"/>
            Adam, all are assembled on that supreme day. And lo the <lb n="30412"/>
            supreme judge is coming! No longer the lowly Lamb of God, <lb n="30413"/>
            no longer the meek Jesus of Nazareth, no longer the Man of <lb n="30414"/>
            Sorrows, no longer the Good Shepherd,  He is seen now coming <lb n="30415"/>
            upon the clouds, in great power and majesty, attended by nine <lb n="30416"/>
            choirs of angels, angels and archangels, principalities, powers <lb n="30417"/>
            and virtues, thrones and dominations, cherubim and seraphim, <lb n="30418"/>
            God Omnipotent, God Everlasting. He speaks: and His voice is <lb n="30419"/>
            heard even at the farthest limits of space, even in the bottom- <lb n="30420"/>
            less abyss. Supreme Judge, from His sentence there will be and <lb n="30421"/>
            can be no appeal. He calls the just to His side bidding them <lb n="30422"/>
            enter into the kingdom, the eternity of bliss prepared for them. <lb n="30423"/>
            The unjust He casts from Him, crying in His offended majesty: <lb n="30424"/>
            <emph>Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire which was</emph> <lb n="30425"/>
            <emph>prepared for the devil and his angels.</emph> O what agony then for <lb n="30426"/>
            the miserable sinners! Friend is torn apart from friend, children are torn <lb n="30427"/>
            from their parents, husbands from their wives. The poor sinner <lb n="30428"/>
            holds out his arms to those who were dear and near to him in <lb n="30429"/>
            this earthly world, to those whose simple piety perhaps he <lb n="30430"/>
            made a mock of, to those who counselled him and tried to lead <lb n="30431"/>
            him on the right path, to a kind brother, to a loving sister, to <lb n="30432"/>
            the mother and father who loved him so dearly. But it is too <lb n="30433"/>
            late: the just turn away from the wretched damned souls which <lb n="30434"/>
            now appear before the eyes of all in their hideous and evil <lb n="30435"/>
            character. O you hypocrites, O you whited sepulchres, O you <lb n="30436"/>
            who present a smooth smiling face to the world while your soul <lb n="30437"/>
            within is a foul swamp of sin, how will it fare with you in that <lb n="30438"/>
            terrible day?<lb n="30439"/> </p>
            <p> And this day will come, shall come, must come: the day of <lb n="30440"/>
            death and the day of judgment. It is appointed unto man to die <lb n="30441"/>
            and after death the judgment. Death is certain. The time and <lb n="30442"/>
            manner are uncertain,  whether from long disease or from some <lb n="30443"/>
            unexpected accident: the Son of God cometh at an hour when <lb n="30444"/>
            you little expect Him. Be therefore ready every moment, seeing <lb n="30445"/>
            that you may die at any moment. Death is the end of us all. <lb n="30446"/>
            Death and judgment, brought into the world by the sin of our <lb n="30447"/>
            first parents, are the dark portals that close our earthly exist- <lb n="30448"/>
            ence, the portals that open into the unknown and the unseen, <lb n="30449"/>
            portals through which every soul must pass, alone, unaided <lb n="30450"/>
            save by its good works, without friend or  brother or parents or <lb n="30451"/>
            master to help it, alone and trembling. Let that thought be ever <lb n="30452"/>
            before our minds and then we cannot sin. Death, a cause of <lb n="30453"/>
            terror to the sinner, is a blessed moment for him who has <lb n="30454"/>
            walked in the right path, fulfilling the duties of his station in <lb n="30455"/>
            life, attending to his morning and evening prayers, approaching <lb n="30456"/>
            the holy sacrament frequently and performing good and mer- <lb n="30457"/>
            ciful works. For the pious and believing catholic, for the just <lb n="30458"/>
            man, death is no cause of terror. Was it not Addison, the great <lb n="30459"/>
            English writer, who, when on his deathbed, sent for the wicked <lb n="30460"/>
            young earl of Warwick to let him see how a christian can meet <lb n="30461"/>
            his end? He it is and he alone, the pious and believing christian, <lb n="30462"/>
            who can say in his heart:<lb n="30463"/> </p>
            <lg>
              O grave, where is thy victory? <lb n="30464"/>
              O death, where is thy sting? <lb n="30465"/>
            </lg>
            <p> Every word of it was for him. Against his sin, foul and <lb n="30466"/>
            secret, the whole wrath of God was aimed. The preacher's <lb n="30467"/>
            knife had probed deeply into his diseased conscience and he felt <lb n="30468"/>
            now that his soul was festering in sin. Yes, the preacher was <lb n="30469"/>
            right. God's turn had come. Like a beast in its lair his soul had <lb n="30470"/>
            lain down in its own filth but the blasts of the angel's trumpet <lb n="30471"/>
            had driven him forth from the darkness of sin into the light. <lb n="30472"/>
            The words of doom cried by the angel shattered in an instant <lb n="30473"/>
            his presumptuous peace. The wind of the last day blew through <lb n="30474"/>
            his mind; his sins, the jeweleyed harlots of his imagination, fled <lb n="30475"/>
            before the hurricane, squeaking like mice in their terror and <lb n="30476"/>
            huddled under a mane of hair.<lb n="30477"/> </p>
            <p> As he crossed the square, walking homeward, the light <lb n="30478"/>
            laughter of a girl reached his burning ears. The frail gay sound <lb n="30479"/>
            smote his heart more strongly than a trumpetblast, and, not <lb n="30480"/>
            daring to lift his eyes, he turned aside and gazed, as he walked, <lb n="30481"/>
            into the shadow of the tangled shrubs. Shame rose from his <lb n="30482"/>
            smitten heart and flooded his whole being. The image of Emma <lb n="30483"/>
            appeared before him and, under her eyes, the flood of shame <lb n="30484"/>
            rushed forth anew from his heart. If she knew to what his mind <lb n="30485"/>
            had subjected her or how his brutelike lust had torn and <lb n="30486"/>
            trampled upon her innocence! Was that boyish love? Was that <lb n="30487"/>
            chivalry? Was that poetry? The sordid details of his orgies stank <lb n="30488"/>
            under his very nostrils: the sootcoated packet of pictures which <lb n="30489"/>
            he had hidden in the flue of the fireplace and in the presence of <lb n="30490"/>
            whose shameless or bashful  wantonness he lay for hours sin- <lb n="30491"/>
            ning in thought and deed: his monstrous dreams, peopled by <lb n="30492"/>
            apelike creatures and by harlots with gleaming jewel eyes: the <lb n="30493"/>
            foul long letters he had written in the joy of guilty confession <lb n="30494"/>
            and carried secretly for days and days only to throw them <lb n="30495"/>
            under cover of night among the grass in the corner of a field or <lb n="30496"/>
            beneath some hingeless door or in some niche in the hedges <lb n="30497"/>
            where a girl might come upon them as she walked by and read <lb n="30498"/>
            them secretly. Mad! Mad! Was it possible he had done these <lb n="30499"/>
            things? A cold sweat broke out upon his forehead as the foul <lb n="30500"/>
            memories condensed within his brain.<lb n="30501"/> </p>
            <p> When the agony of shame had passed from him he tried to <lb n="30502"/>
            raise his soul from its abject powerlessness. God and the <lb n="30503"/>
            Blessed Virgin were too far from him: God was too great and <lb n="30504"/>
            stern and the Blessed Virgin too pure and holy. But he imagined <lb n="30505"/>
            that he stood near Emma in a wide land and,  humbly  and in <lb n="30506"/>
            tears, bent and kissed the elbow of her sleeve.<lb n="30507"/> </p>
            <p> In a wide land under a tender lucid evening sky, a cloud <lb n="30508"/>
            drifting westward amid a pale green sea of heaven, they stood <lb n="30509"/>
            together, children that had  erred. Their error had offended <lb n="30510"/>
            deeply God's majesty, though it was the error of two children, <lb n="30511"/>
            but it had not offended her whose beauty <emph>is not like earthly</emph> <lb n="30512"/>
            <emph>beauty, dangerous to look upon, but like the morning star</emph> <lb n="30513"/>
            <emph>which is its emblem, bright and musical</emph>. The eyes were not <lb n="30514"/>
            offended which she turned upon them nor reproachful. She <lb n="30515"/>
            placed their hands together, hand in hand, and said, speaking <lb n="30516"/>
            to their hearts: <lb n="30517"/>
             <said who="Virgin Mary">―Take hands, Stephen and Emma. It is a beautiful evening <lb n="30518"/>
            now in heaven. You have erred but you are always my children. <lb n="30519"/>
            It is one heart that loves another heart. Take hands together, <lb n="30520"/>
            my dear children, and you  will  be happy together and your <lb n="30521"/>
            hearts will love each other.<lb n="30522"/></said> </p>
            <p> The chapel was flooded by the dull scarlet light that filtered <lb n="30523"/>
            through the lowered blinds: and through the fissure between <lb n="30524"/>
            the last blind and the sash a shaft of wan light entered like a <lb n="30525"/>
            spear and touched the embossed brasses of the candlesticks <lb n="30526"/>
            upon the altar that gleamed like the battleworn mail armour of <lb n="30527"/>
            angels.<lb n="30528"/> </p>
            <p> Rain was falling on the chapel, on the garden, on the college. <lb n="30529"/>
            It would rain for ever, noiselessly. The water would rise inch <lb n="30530"/>
            by inch, covering the grass and shrubs, covering the trees and <lb n="30531"/>
            houses, covering the monuments and the mountain tops. All <lb n="30532"/>
            life would be choked off, noiselessly: birds, men, elephants, <lb n="30533"/>
            pigs, children: noiselessly floating corpses amid the litter of the <lb n="30534"/>
            wreckage of the world. Forty days and forty nights the rain <lb n="30535"/>
            would fall till the waters covered the face of the earth.<lb n="30536"/> </p>
            <p> It might be. Why not? <lb n="30537"/>
             <said who="Father Arnall">―<emph>Hell has enlarged its soul and opened its mouth without any</emph> <lb n="30538"/>
            <emph>limits</emph> – words taken, my dear little brothers in Christ Jesus, <lb n="30539"/>
            from the book of Isaias, fifth chapter, fourteenth verse. In the <lb n="30540"/>
            name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost. <lb n="30541"/>
            Amen.<lb n="30542"/></said> </p>
            <p> The preacher took a chainless watch from a pocket within <lb n="30543"/>
            his soutane and, having considered its dial for a moment in <lb n="30544"/>
            silence, placed it silently before him on the table.<lb n="30545"/> </p>
            <p> He began  to speak in a quiet tone. <lb n="30546"/>
             <said who="Father Arnall">―Adam and Eve, my dear boys, were, as you know, our first <lb n="30547"/>
            parents and you will remember that they were created by God <lb n="30548"/>
            in order that the seats in heaven left vacant by the fall of <lb n="30549"/>
            Lucifer and his rebellious angels might be filled again. Lucifer, <lb n="30550"/>
            we are  told, was a son of the morning, a radiant and mighty <lb n="30551"/>
            angel; yet he fell: he fell and there fell with him a third part of <lb n="30552"/>
            the host of heaven: he fell and was hurled with his rebellious <lb n="30553"/>
            angels into hell. What his sin was we cannot say. Theologians <lb n="30554"/>
            consider that it was the sin of pride, the sinful thought con- <lb n="30555"/>
            ceived in an instant: <emph><seg xml:lang="la">non serviam</seg>: I will not serve</emph>. That instant <lb n="30556"/>
            was his ruin. He offended the majesty of God by the sinful <lb n="30557"/>
            thought of one instant and God cast him out of heaven into hell <lb n="30558"/>
            for ever.<lb n="30559"/> </said>
             <said who="Father Arnall">―Adam and Eve were then created by God and placed in <lb n="30560"/>
            Eden, that lovely garden in the plain of Damascus that lovely garden resplendent <lb n="30561"/>
            with sunlight and colour, teeming with luxuriant vegetation. <lb n="30562"/>
            The fruitful earth gave them her bounty: beasts and birds were <lb n="30563"/>
            their willing servants: they knew not the ills our flesh is heir to, <lb n="30564"/>
            disease and poverty and death: all that a great and generous <lb n="30565"/>
            God could do for them was done. But there was one condition <lb n="30566"/>
            imposed on them by God: obedience to His word. They were <lb n="30567"/>
            not to eat of the fruit of the forbidden tree.<lb n="30568"/> </said>
             <said who="Father Arnall">―Alas, my dear little boys, they too fell. The devil, once a <lb n="30569"/>
            shining angel, a son of the morning, now a foul fiend came to <lb n="30570"/>
            them in the shape of a serpent, the subtlest of all the beasts of <lb n="30571"/>
            the field. He envied them. He, the fallen great one, could not <lb n="30572"/>
            bear to think that man, a being of clay, should possess the <lb n="30573"/>
            inheritance which he by his sin had forfeited for ever. He came <lb n="30574"/>
            to the woman, the weaker vessel, and poured the poison of his <lb n="30575"/>
            eloquence into her ear, promising her  (O, the blasphemy of that <lb n="30576"/>
            promise!) that if she and Adam ate of the forbidden fruit they <lb n="30577"/>
            would become as gods, nay as God Himself. Eve yielded to the <lb n="30578"/>
            wiles of the archtempter. She ate the apple and gave it also to <lb n="30579"/>
            Adam who had not the moral courage to resist her. The poison <lb n="30580"/>
            tongue of Satan had done its work. They fell.<lb n="30581"/> </said>
             <said who="Father Arnall">―And then the voice of God was heard in that garden, calling <lb n="30582"/>
            His creature man to account: and Michael, prince of the heav- <lb n="30583"/>
            enly host, with a sword of flame in his hand appeared before <lb n="30584"/>
            the guilty pair and drove them forth from Eden into the world, <lb n="30585"/>
            the world of sickness and striving, of cruelty and disappoint- <lb n="30586"/>
            ment, of labour and hardship, to earn their bread in the sweat <lb n="30587"/>
            of their brow. But even then how merciful was God! He took <lb n="30588"/>
            pity on our poor degraded first parents and promised that in <lb n="30589"/>
            the fulness of time He would send down from heaven One who <lb n="30590"/>
            would redeem them, make them once more children of God <lb n="30591"/>
            and heirs to the kingdom of heaven: and that One, that <lb n="30592"/>
            Redeemer of fallen man, was to be God's onlybegotten  Son, the <lb n="30593"/>
            Second Person of the Most Blessed Trinity, the Eternal Word.<lb n="30594"/> </said>
             <said who="Father Arnall">―He came. He was born of a virgin pure, Mary the virgin <lb n="30595"/>
            mother. He was born in a poor cowhouse in Judea and lived as <lb n="30596"/>
            a humble carpenter for thirty years until the hour of His <lb n="30597"/>
            mission had come. And then, filled with love for men, He went <lb n="30598"/>
            forth and called to men to hear the new gospel.<lb n="30599"/> </said>
             <said who="Father Arnall">―Did they listen? Yes, they listened but would not hear. He <lb n="30600"/>
            was seized and bound like a common criminal, mocked at as a <lb n="30601"/>
            fool, set aside to give place to a public robber, scourged with <lb n="30602"/>
            five thousand lashes, crowned with a crown of thorns, hustled <lb n="30603"/>
            through the streets by the jewish rabble and the Roman sol- <lb n="30604"/>
            diery, stripped of His garments and hanged upon a gibbet and <lb n="30605"/>
            His side was pierced with a lance and from the wounded body <lb n="30606"/>
            of Our Lord water and blood issued continually.<lb n="30607"/> </said>
             <said who="Father Arnall">―Yet even then, in that hour of supreme agony, Our Merciful <lb n="30608"/>
            Redeemer had pity for mankind. Yet even there, on the hill of <lb n="30609"/>
            Calvary, He founded the holy catholic church against which, it <lb n="30610"/>
            is promised, the gates of hell shall not prevail. He founded it <lb n="30611"/>
            upon the rock of ages and endowed it with His grace, with <lb n="30612"/>
            sacraments and sacrifice, and promised that if men would obey <lb n="30613"/>
            the word of His church they would still enter into eternal life <lb n="30614"/>
            but if, after all that had been done for them, they still persisted <lb n="30615"/>
            in their wickedness there  remained for them an eternity of <lb n="30616"/>
            torment: hell.<lb n="30617"/></said> </p>
            <p> The preacher's voice sank. He paused, joined his palms for <lb n="30618"/>
            an instant, parted them. Then he resumed: <lb n="30619"/>
             <said who="Father Arnall">―Now let us try for a moment to realise, as far as we can, the <lb n="30620"/>
            nature of that abode of the damned which the justice of an <lb n="30621"/>
            offended God has called into existence for the eternal punish- <lb n="30622"/>
            ment of sinners. Hell is a strait and dark and foulsmelling <lb n="30623"/>
            prison, an abode of demons and lost souls, filled with fire and <lb n="30624"/>
            smoke. The straitness of this prison house is expressly designed <lb n="30625"/>
            by God to punish those who refused to be bound by His laws. <lb n="30626"/>
            In earthly prisons the poor captive has at least some liberty of <lb n="30627"/>
            movement, were it only within the four walls of his cell or in <lb n="30628"/>
            the gloomy yard of his prison. Not so in hell. There, by reason <lb n="30629"/>
            of the great number of the damned, the prisoners are heaped <lb n="30630"/>
            together in their awful prison the walls of which are said to be <lb n="30631"/>
            four thousand miles thick: and the damned are so utterly <lb n="30632"/>
            bound and helpless that, as a blessed saint, saint Anselm, writes <lb n="30633"/>
            in his book on similitudes, they are not even able to remove <lb n="30634"/>
            from the eye a worm that gnaws it.<lb n="30635"/> </said>
             <said who="Father Arnall">―They lie in exterior darkness. For, remember, the fire of hell <lb n="30636"/>
            gives forth no light. As, at the command of God, the fire of the <lb n="30637"/>
            Babylonian furnace lost its heat but not its light so, at the <lb n="30638"/>
            command of God, the fire of hell, while retaining the intensity <lb n="30639"/>
            of its heat, burns eternally in darkness. It is a neverending <lb n="30640"/>
            storm of darkness, dark flames and dark smoke of burning <lb n="30641"/>
            brimstone, amid which the bodies are heaped one upon another <lb n="30642"/>
            without even a glimpse of air. Of all the plagues with which the <lb n="30643"/>
            land of the Pharaohs was smitten one plague alone, that of <lb n="30644"/>
            darkness, was called horrible. What name, then, shall we give <lb n="30645"/>
            to the darkness of hell which is to last not for three days alone <lb n="30646"/>
            but for all eternity?<lb n="30647"/> </said>
             <said who="Father Arnall">―The horror of this strait and dark prison is increased by its <lb n="30648"/>
            awful stench. All the filth of the world, all the offal and scum <lb n="30649"/>
            of the world, we are told, shall run there as to a vast reeking <lb n="30650"/>
            sewer when the terrible conflagration of the last day has purged <lb n="30651"/>
            the world. The brimstone too which burns there in such pro- <lb n="30652"/>
            digious quantity fills all hell with its intolerable stench: and the <lb n="30653"/>
            bodies of the damned themselves exhale such a pestilential <lb n="30654"/>
            odour that, as saint Bonaventure says, one of them alone would <lb n="30655"/>
            suffice to infect the whole world. The very air of this world, <lb n="30656"/>
            that pure element, becomes foul and unbreathable when it has <lb n="30657"/>
            been long enclosed. Consider then what must be the foulness of <lb n="30658"/>
            the air of hell. Imagine some foul and putrid corpse that has <lb n="30659"/>
            lain rotting and decomposing in the grave, a jellylike mass of <lb n="30660"/>
            liquid corruption. Imagine such a corpse a prey to  flames, <lb n="30661"/>
            devoured by the fire of burning brimstone and giving off dense <lb n="30662"/>
            choking fumes of nauseous loathsome decomposition. And <lb n="30663"/>
            then imagine this sickening stench, multiplied a millionfold and <lb n="30664"/>
            a millionfold again from the millions upon millions of fetid <lb n="30665"/>
            carcases massed together in the reeking darkness,  a huge and <lb n="30666"/>
            rotting human fungus. Imagine all this and you will have some <lb n="30667"/>
            idea of the horror of the stench of hell.<lb n="30668"/> </said>
             <said who="Father Arnall">―But this stench is not, horrible though it is, the greatest <lb n="30669"/>
            physical torment to which the damned are subjected. The <lb n="30670"/>
            torment of fire is the greatest torment to which the tyrant has <lb n="30671"/>
            ever subjected his fellowcreatures. Place your finger for a mo- <lb n="30672"/>
            ment in the flame of a candle and you will feel the pain of fire. <lb n="30673"/>
            But our earthly fire was created by God for the benefit of man, <lb n="30674"/>
            to maintain in him the spark of life and to help him in the <lb n="30675"/>
            useful arts whereas the fire of hell is of another quality and was <lb n="30676"/>
            created by God to torture and punish the unrepentant sinner. <lb n="30677"/>
            Our earthly fire also consumes more or less rapidly according <lb n="30678"/>
            as the object which it attacks is more or less combustible so <lb n="30679"/>
            that human ingenuity has even succeeded in inventing chemical <lb n="30680"/>
            preparations to check or frustrate its action. But the sulphu- <lb n="30681"/>
            reous brimstone which burns in hell is a substance which is <lb n="30682"/>
            specially designed to burn for ever and for ever with unspeak- <lb n="30683"/>
            able fury. Moreover our earthly fire destroys at the same time <lb n="30684"/>
            as it burns so that the more intense it is the shorter is its dur- <lb n="30685"/>
            ation: but the fire of hell has this property that it preserves that <lb n="30686"/>
            which it burns and though it rages with incredible intensity it <lb n="30687"/>
            rages for ever.<lb n="30688"/> </said>
             <said who="Father Arnall">―Our earthly fire again, no matter how fierce or widespread it <lb n="30689"/>
            may be, is always of a limited extent: but the lake of fire in hell <lb n="30690"/>
            is boundless, shoreless and bottomless. It is on record that the <lb n="30691"/>
            devil himself, when asked the question by a certain soldier, was <lb n="30692"/>
            obliged to confess that if a whole mountain were thrown into <lb n="30693"/>
            the burning ocean of hell it would be burned up in an instant <lb n="30694"/>
            like a piece of wax. And this terrible fire will not afflict the <lb n="30695"/>
            bodies of the damned only from without but each lost soul will <lb n="30696"/>
            be a hell unto itself, the boundless fire raging in its very vitals. <lb n="30697"/>
            O, how terrible is the lot of those wretched beings! The blood <lb n="30698"/>
            seethes and boils in the veins, the brains are boiling in the skull, <lb n="30699"/>
            the heart in the breast glowing and bursting, the bowels a <lb n="30700"/>
            redhot mass of burning pulp, the tender eyes flaming like mol- <lb n="30701"/>
            ten balls.<lb n="30702"/> </said>
             <said who="Father Arnall">―And yet what I have said as to the strength and quality and <lb n="30703"/>
            boundlessness of this fire is as nothing when compared to its <lb n="30704"/>
            intensity, an intensity which it has as being the instrument <lb n="30705"/>
            chosen by divine design for the punishment of soul and body <lb n="30706"/>
            alike. It is a fire which proceeds directly from the ire of God, <lb n="30707"/>
            working not of its own activity but as an instrument of divine <lb n="30708"/>
            vengeance. As the waters of baptism cleanse the soul with the <lb n="30709"/>
            body so do the fires of punishment torture the spirit with the <lb n="30710"/>
            flesh. Every sense of the flesh is tortured and every faculty of <lb n="30711"/>
            the soul therewith: the eyes with impenetrable utter darkness, <lb n="30712"/>
            the nose with noisome odours, the ears with yells and howls <lb n="30713"/>
            and execrations, the taste with foul matter, leprous corruption, <lb n="30714"/>
            nameless suffocating filth, the touch with redhot goads and <lb n="30715"/>
            spikes, with cruel tongues of flame. And through the several <lb n="30716"/>
            torments of the senses the immortal soul is tortured eternally in <lb n="30717"/>
            its very essence amid the leagues upon leagues of glowing fires <lb n="30718"/>
            kindled in the abyss by the offended majesty of the Omnipotent <lb n="30719"/>
            God and fanned into everlasting and ever increasing fury by the <lb n="30720"/>
            breath of the anger of the Godhead.<lb n="30721"/> </said>
             <said who="Father Arnall">―Consider finally that the torment of this infernal prison is <lb n="30722"/>
            increased by the company of the damned themselves. Evil com- <lb n="30723"/>
            pany on earth is so noxious that even the plants, as if by <lb n="30724"/>
            instinct, withdraw from the company of whatsoever is deadly <lb n="30725"/>
            or hurtful to them. In hell all laws are overturned: there is no <lb n="30726"/>
            thought of family or country, of ties or relationship. The <lb n="30727"/>
            damned howl and scream at one another, their torture and rage <lb n="30728"/>
            intensified by the presence of beings tortured and raging like <lb n="30729"/>
            themselves. All sense of humanity is forgotten. The yells of the <lb n="30730"/>
            suffering sinners fill the remotest corners of the vast abyss. The <lb n="30731"/>
            mouths of the damned are full of blasphemies against God and <lb n="30732"/>
            of hatred for their fellow sufferers and of curses against those <lb n="30733"/>
            souls which were their  accomplices in sin. In olden times it was <lb n="30734"/>
            the custom to punish the parricide, the man who had raised his <lb n="30735"/>
            murderous hand against his father, by casting him into the <lb n="30736"/>
            depths of the sea in a sack in which were placed a cock, a <lb n="30737"/>
            monkey and a serpent. The intention of those lawgivers who <lb n="30738"/>
            framed such a law, which seems cruel in our times, was to <lb n="30739"/>
            punish the criminal by the company of hateful and hurtful <lb n="30740"/>
            beasts. But what is the fury of those dumb beasts compared <lb n="30741"/>
            with the fury of execration which bursts from the parched lips <lb n="30742"/>
            and aching throats of the damned in hell when they behold in <lb n="30743"/>
            their companions in misery those who aided and abetted them <lb n="30744"/>
            in sin, those whose words sowed the first seeds of evil thinking <lb n="30745"/>
            and evil living in their minds, those whose immodest sugges- <lb n="30746"/>
            tions led them on to sin, those whose eyes tempted and allured <lb n="30747"/>
            them from the path of virtue. They turn upon those accom- <lb n="30748"/>
            plices and upbraid them and curse them. But they are helpless <lb n="30749"/>
            and hopeless: it is too late now for repentance.<lb n="30750"/> </said>
             <said who="Father Arnall">―Last of all consider the frightful torment to those damned <lb n="30751"/>
            souls, tempters and tempted alike,  of the company of the devils. <lb n="30752"/>
            These devils will afflict the damned in two ways, by their pres- <lb n="30753"/>
            ence and by their reproaches. We can have no idea of how <lb n="30754"/>
            horrible these devils are. Saint Catherine of Siena once saw a <lb n="30755"/>
            devil and she has written that, rather than look again for one <lb n="30756"/>
            single instant on such a frightful monster, she would prefer to <lb n="30757"/>
            walk until the end of her life along a track of red coals. These <lb n="30758"/>
            devils, who were once beautiful angels, have become as hideous <lb n="30759"/>
            and ugly as they once were beautiful. They mock and  jeer at <lb n="30760"/>
            the lost souls whom they dragged down to ruin. It is they, the <lb n="30761"/>
            foul demons, who are made in hell the voices of conscience. <lb n="30762"/>
            Why did you sin? Why did you lend an ear to the temptings of <lb n="30763"/>
            fiends? Why did you turn aside from your pious practices and <lb n="30764"/>
            good works? Why did you not shun the occasions of sin? Why <lb n="30765"/>
            did you not leave that evil companion? Why did you not give <lb n="30766"/>
            up that lewd habit, that impure habit? Why did you not listen <lb n="30767"/>
            to the counsels of your confessor? Why did you not, even after <lb n="30768"/>
            you had fallen the first or the second or the third or the fourth <lb n="30769"/>
            or the hundredth time, repent of your evil ways and turn to <lb n="30770"/>
            God who only waited for your repentance to absolve you of <lb n="30771"/>
            your sins? Now the time for repentance has gone by. Time is, <lb n="30772"/>
            time was but time shall be no more! Time was to sin in secrecy, <lb n="30773"/>
            to indulge in that sloth and pride, to covet the unlawful, to <lb n="30774"/>
            yield to the promptings of your lower nature, to live like the <lb n="30775"/>
            beasts of the field, nay worse than the beasts of the field for <lb n="30776"/>
            they, at least, are but brutes and have not reason to guide them: <lb n="30777"/>
            time was but time shall be no more. God spoke to you by so <lb n="30778"/>
            many voices but you would not hear. You would not crush out <lb n="30779"/>
            that pride and anger in your heart, you would not restore those <lb n="30780"/>
            illgotten goods, you would not obey the precepts of your holy <lb n="30781"/>
            church nor attend to your religious duties, you would not <lb n="30782"/>
            abandon those wicked companions, you would not avoid those <lb n="30783"/>
            dangerous temptations. Such is the language of those fiendish <lb n="30784"/>
            tormentors, words of taunting and of reproach, of hatred and <lb n="30785"/>
            of disgust. Of disgust, yes! For even they, the very devils, when <lb n="30786"/>
            they sinned sinned by such a sin as alone was compatible with <lb n="30787"/>
            such angelical natures, a rebellion of the intellect: and they, <lb n="30788"/>
            even they, the foul devils must turn away, revolted and dis- <lb n="30789"/>
            gusted, from the contemplation of those unspeakable sins by <lb n="30790"/>
            which degraded man outrages and defiles the temple of the <lb n="30791"/>
            Holy Ghost, defiles and pollutes himself.<lb n="30792"/> </said>
             <said who="Father Arnall">―O, my dear little brothers in Christ, may it never be our lot <lb n="30793"/>
            to hear that language! May it never be our lot, I say! In the last <lb n="30794"/>
            day of terrible reckoning I pray fervently to God that not a <lb n="30795"/>
            single soul of those who are in this chapel today may be found <lb n="30796"/>
            among those miserable beings whom the Great Judge shall <lb n="30797"/>
            command to depart for ever from His sight, that not one of us <lb n="30798"/>
            may ever hear ringing in his ears the awful sentence of rejec- <lb n="30799"/>
            tion: <emph>Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire which</emph> <lb n="30800"/>
            <emph>was prepared for the devil and his angels!</emph><lb n="30801"/></said> </p>
            <p> He came down the aisle of the chapel, his legs shaking and <lb n="30802"/>
            the scalp of his head trembling as though it had been touched <lb n="30803"/>
            by ghostly fingers. He passed up the staircase and into the <lb n="30804"/>
            corridor along the walls of which the overcoats and water- <lb n="30805"/>
            proofs hung like gibbeted malefactors, headless and dripping <lb n="30806"/>
            and shapeless. And at every step he feared that he had already <lb n="30807"/>
            died, that his soul had been wrenched forth of the sheath of his <lb n="30808"/>
            body, that he was plunging headlong through space.<lb n="30809"/> </p>
            <p> He could not grip the floor with his feet and sat heavily at <lb n="30810"/>
            his desk, opening one of his books at random and poring over <lb n="30811"/>
            it. Every word for him! It was true. God was almighty. God <lb n="30812"/>
            could call him now, call him as he sat at his desk, before he had <lb n="30813"/>
            time to be conscious of the summons. God had called him. Yes? <lb n="30814"/>
            What? Yes? His flesh shrank together as it felt the approach of <lb n="30815"/>
            the ravenous tongues of flames, dried up as it felt about it the <lb n="30816"/>
            swirl of stifling air. He had died. Yes. He was judged. A wave <lb n="30817"/>
            of fire swept through his body: the first. Again a wave. His <lb n="30818"/>
            brain began to glow. Another. His brain was simmering and <lb n="30819"/>
            bubbling within the cracking tenement of the skull. Flames <lb n="30820"/>
            burst forth from his skull like a corolla, shrieking like voices: <lb n="30821"/>
             <said who="Flames">―Hell! Hell! Hell! Hell! Hell!<lb n="30822"/></said> </p>
            <p> Voices spoke near him: <lb n="30823"/>
             <said who="a voice">―On hell.<lb n="30824"/> </said>
             <said who="a voice">―I suppose he rubbed it into you well.<lb n="30825"/> </said>
             <said who="a voice">―You bet he did. He put us all into a blue funk.<lb n="30826"/> </said>
             <said who="a voice">―That's what you fellows want: and plenty of it to make you <lb n="30827"/>
            work.<lb n="30828"/></said> </p>
            <p> He leaned back weakly in his desk. He had not died. God <lb n="30829"/>
            had spared him still. He was still in the familiar world of the <lb n="30830"/>
            school. Mr Tate and Vincent Heron stood at the window, <lb n="30831"/>
            talking, jesting, gazing out at the bleak rain, moving their }|lb n="30833"/| heads. <lb n="30832"/>
            <said who="Mr Tate">―I wish it would clear up. I had arranged to go for a spin on <lb n="30834"/>
            the bike with some fellows out by <place><location><geo>53.450924 -6.150138</geo></location><placeName>Malahide</placeName></place>. But the roads <lb n="30835"/>
            must be kneedeep.<lb n="30836"/> </said>
            <said who="Vincent Heron">―It might clear up, sir.<lb n="30837"/></said> </p>
            <p>The voices that he knew so well, the common words, the <lb n="30838"/>
            quiet of the classroom when the voices paused and the silence <lb n="30839"/>
            was filled by the sound of softly browsing cattle as the other <lb n="30840"/>
            boys munched their lunches tranquilly, lulled his aching soul.<lb n="30841"/> </p>
            <p> There was still time. O Mary, refuge of sinners, intercede for <lb n="30842"/>
            him! O Virgin Undefiled, save him from the gulf of death!<lb n="30843"/> </p>
            <p> The English lesson began with the hearing of the history. <lb n="30844"/>
            Royal persons, favourites, intriguers, bishops passed like mute <lb n="30845"/>
            phantoms behind their veil of names. All had died: all had been <lb n="30846"/>
            judged. What did it profit a man to gain the whole world if he <lb n="30847"/>
            lost his soul? At last he had understood: and human life lay <lb n="30848"/>
            around him, a plain of peace whereon antlike men laboured in <lb n="30849"/>
            brotherhood, their dead sleeping under quiet mounds. The el- <lb n="30850"/>
            bow of his companion touched him and his heart was touched: <lb n="30851"/>
            and when he spoke to answer a question of his master he heard <lb n="30852"/>
            his own voice full of the quietude of humility and contrition.<lb n="30853"/> </p>
            <p> His soul sank back deeper into depths of contrite peace, no <lb n="30854"/>
            longer able to suffer the pain of dread and sending forth, as she <lb n="30855"/>
            sank, a faint prayer. Ah yes, he would still be spared; he would <lb n="30856"/>
            repent in his heart and be forgiven: and then those above, those <lb n="30857"/>
            in heaven, would see what he would do to make up for the <lb n="30858"/>
            past: a whole life, every hour of life. Only wait. <lb n="30859"/>
             <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―All, God! All, all!<lb n="30860"/></said> </p>
            <p> A messenger came to the door to say that confessions were <lb n="30861"/>
            being heard in the chapel. Four boys left the room; and he <lb n="30862"/>
            heard others passing down the corridor. A tremulous chill blew <lb n="30863"/>
            round his heart, no stronger than a little wind, and yet, listen- <lb n="30864"/>
            ing and suffering silently, he seemed to have laid an ear against <lb n="30865"/>
            the muscle of his own heart, feeling it close and quail, listening <lb n="30866"/>
            to the flutter of its ventricles.<lb n="30867"/> </p>
            <p> No escape. He had to confess, to speak out in words what he <lb n="30868"/>
            had done and thought, sin after sin. How? How? <lb n="30869"/>
             <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Father, I ...<lb n="30870"/></said> </p>
            <p>The thought slid like a cold shining rapier into his tender <lb n="30871"/>
            flesh: confession. But not there in the chapel of the college. He <lb n="30872"/>
            would confess all, every sin of deed and thought, sincerely: but <lb n="30873"/>
            not there among his school companions. Far away from there <lb n="30874"/>
            in some dark place he would murmur out his own shame: and <lb n="30875"/>
            he besought God humbly not to be offended with him if he did <lb n="30876"/>
            not dare to confess in the college chapel: and in utter abjection <lb n="30877"/>
            of spirit he craved forgiveness mutely of the boyish hearts <lb n="30878"/>
            about him.<lb n="30879"/> </p>
            <p> Time passed.<lb n="30880"/> </p>
            <p> He sat again in the front bench of the chapel. The daylight <lb n="30881"/>
            without was already failing and, as it fell slowly through the <lb n="30882"/>
            dull red blinds, it seemed that the sun of the last day was going <lb n="30883"/>
            down and that all souls were being gathered for the judgment. <lb n="30884"/>
             <said who="Father Arnall">―<emph>I am cast away from the sight of Thine eyes:</emph> words taken, <lb n="30885"/>
            my dear little brothers in Christ, from the Book of Psalms, <lb n="30886"/>
            thirtieth chapter, twentythird verse. In the name of the Father <lb n="30887"/>
            and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.<lb n="30888"/></said> </p>
            <p> The preacher began to speak in a quiet friendly tone. His <lb n="30889"/>
            face was kind and he joined gently the fingers of each hand, <lb n="30890"/>
            forming a frail cage by the union of their tips. <lb n="30891"/>
             <said who="Father Arnall">―This morning we endeavoured, in our reflection upon hell, <lb n="30892"/>
            to make what our holy founder calls in his book of spiritual <lb n="30893"/>
            exercises, the composition of place. We endeavoured, that is, to <lb n="30894"/>
            imagine with the senses of the mind, in our imagination, the <lb n="30895"/>
            material character of that awful place and of the physical tor- <lb n="30896"/>
            ments which all who are in hell endure. This evening we shall <lb n="30897"/>
            consider for a few moments the nature of the spiritual torments <lb n="30898"/>
            of hell.<lb n="30899"/> </said>
             <said who="Father Arnall">―Sin, remember, is a twofold enormity. It is a base consent to <lb n="30900"/>
            the promptings of our corrupt nature, to the lower instincts, to <lb n="30901"/>
            that which is gross and beastlike; and it is also a turning away <lb n="30902"/>
            from the counsel of our higher nature, from all that is pure and <lb n="30903"/>
            holy, from the Holy God Himself. For this reason mortal sin is <lb n="30904"/>
            punished in hell by two different forms of punishment, physical <lb n="30905"/>
            and spiritual.<lb n="30906"/> </said>
             <said who="Father Arnall">―Now of all these spiritual pains by far the greatest is the pain <lb n="30907"/>
            of loss, so great, in fact, that in itself it is a torment greater <lb n="30908"/>
            than all the others. Saint Thomas, the greatest doctor of the <lb n="30909"/>
            church, the angelic doctor, as he is called, says that the worst <lb n="30910"/>
            damnation consists in this that the understanding of man is <lb n="30911"/>
            totally deprived of divine light and his affection obstinately <lb n="30912"/>
            turned away from the goodness of God. God, remember, is a <lb n="30913"/>
            being infinitely good and therefore the loss of such a being <lb n="30914"/>
            must be a loss infinitely painful. In this life we have not a very <lb n="30915"/>
            clear idea of what such a loss must be but the damned in hell, <lb n="30916"/>
            for their greater torment, have a full understanding of that <lb n="30917"/>
            which they have lost and understand  that they have lost it <lb n="30918"/>
            through their own sins and have lost it for ever. At the very <lb n="30919"/>
            instant of death the bonds of the flesh are broken asunder and <lb n="30920"/>
            the soul at once flies towards God. The soul tends towards <lb n="30921"/>
            God as towards the centre of her existence. Remember, my <lb n="30922"/>
            dear little boys, our souls long to be with God. We come from <lb n="30923"/>
            God, we live by God, we belong to God: we are His, inalien- <lb n="30924"/>
            ably His. God loves with a divine love every human soul and <lb n="30925"/>
            every human soul lives in that love. How could it be otherwise? <lb n="30926"/>
            Every breath that we draw, every thought of our brain, every <lb n="30927"/>
            instant of life proceed from God's inexhaustible goodness. And <lb n="30928"/>
            if it be pain for a mother to be parted from her child, for a man <lb n="30929"/>
            to be exiled from hearth and home, for friend to be sundered <lb n="30930"/>
            from friend, O think what pain, what anguish it must be for <lb n="30931"/>
            the poor soul to be spurned from the presence of the supremely <lb n="30932"/>
            good and loving Creator Who has called that soul into exist- <lb n="30933"/>
            ence from nothingness and sustained it in life and loved it with <lb n="30934"/>
            an immeasurable love. This, then, to be separated for ever from <lb n="30935"/>
            its greatest good, from God, and to feel the anguish of that <lb n="30936"/>
            separation, knowing full well that it is unchangeable, this is the <lb n="30937"/>
            greatest torment which the created soul is capable of bearing, <lb n="30938"/>
            <seg xml:lang="la">poena damni</seg>, the pain of loss.<lb n="30939"/> </said>
             <said who="Father Arnall">―The second pain which will afflict the souls of the damned in <lb n="30940"/>
            hell is the pain of conscience. Just as in dead bodies worms are <lb n="30941"/>
            engendered by putrefaction so in the souls of the lost there <lb n="30942"/>
            arises a perpetual remorse from the putrefaction of sin, the <lb n="30943"/>
            sting of conscience, the worm, as Pope Innocent the Third calls <lb n="30944"/>
            it, of the triple sting. The first sting inflicted by this cruel worm <lb n="30945"/>
            will be the memory of past pleasures. O what a dreadful mem- <lb n="30946"/>
            ory will that be! In the lake of alldevouring flame the proud <lb n="30947"/>
            king will remember the pomps of his court, the wise but wicked <lb n="30948"/>
            man his libraries and instruments of research, the lover of ar- <lb n="30949"/>
            tistic pleasures his marbles and pictures and other art treasures, <lb n="30950"/>
            he who delighted in the pleasures of the table his gorgeous <lb n="30951"/>
            feasts, his dishes prepared with such delicacy, his choice wines; <lb n="30952"/>
            the miser will remember his hoard of gold, the robber his <lb n="30953"/>
            illgotten wealth, the angry and revengeful and merciless mur- <lb n="30954"/>
            derers their deeds of blood and violence in which they revelled, <lb n="30955"/>
            the impure and adulterous the unspeakable and filthy pleasures <lb n="30956"/>
            in which they delighted. They will remember all this and loathe <lb n="30957"/>
            themselves and their sins. For how miserable will all those <lb n="30958"/>
            pleasures seem to the soul condemned to suffer in hellfire for <lb n="30959"/>
            ages and ages. How they will rage and fume to think that they <lb n="30960"/>
            have lost the bliss of heaven for the dross of earth, for a few <lb n="30961"/>
            pieces of metal, for vain honours, for bodily comforts, for a <lb n="30962"/>
            tingling of the nerves. They will repent indeed: and this is the <lb n="30963"/>
            second sting of the worm of conscience, a late and fruitless <lb n="30964"/>
            sorrow for sins committed. Divine justice insists that the under- <lb n="30965"/>
            standing of those miserable wretches be fixed continually on <lb n="30966"/>
            the sins of which they were guilty and, moreover, as saint <lb n="30967"/>
            Augustine points out, God will impart to them His own <lb n="30968"/>
            knowledge of sin so that sin will appear to them in all its <lb n="30969"/>
            hideous malice as it appears to the eyes of God Himself. They <lb n="30970"/>
            will behold their sins in all their foulness and repent but it will <lb n="30971"/>
            be too late and then they will bewail the good occasions which <lb n="30972"/>
            they neglected. This is the last and deepest and most cruel sting <lb n="30973"/>
            of the worm of conscience. The conscience will say: You had <lb n="30974"/>
            time and opportunity to repent and would not. You were <lb n="30975"/>
            brought up religiously by your parents. You had the sacraments <lb n="30976"/>
            and graces and indulgences of the church to aid you. You had <lb n="30977"/>
            the minister of God to preach to you, to call you back when <lb n="30978"/>
            you had strayed, to forgive you your sins, no matter how many, <lb n="30979"/>
            how abominable, if only you had confessed and repented. No. <lb n="30980"/>
            You would not. You flouted the ministers of holy religion, you <lb n="30981"/>
            turned your back on the confessional, you wallowed deeper <lb n="30982"/>
            and deeper in the mire of sin. God appealed to you, threatened <lb n="30983"/>
            you, entreated you to return to Him. O what shame, what <lb n="30984"/>
            misery! The ruler of the universe entreated you, a creature <lb n="30985"/>
            of clay, to love Him Who  made you and to keep His law. <lb n="30986"/>
            No. You would not. And now, though you were to flood all <lb n="30987"/>
            hell with your tears if you could still weep, all that sea of <lb n="30988"/>
            repentance would not gain for you what a single tear of true <lb n="30989"/>
            repentance shed during your mortal life would have gained for <lb n="30990"/>
            you. You implore now a moment of earthly life wherein to <lb n="30991"/>
            repent: in vain. That time is gone: gone for ever.<lb n="30992"/> </said>
             <said who="Father Arnall">―Such is the threefold sting of conscience, the viper which <lb n="30993"/>
            gnaws the very heart's core of the wretches in hell so that filled <lb n="30994"/>
            with hellish fury they curse themselves for their folly and curse <lb n="30995"/>
            the evil companions who have brought them to such ruin and <lb n="30996"/>
            curse the devils who tempted them in life and now mock them <lb n="30997"/>
            and torture them in eternity and even revile and curse the <lb n="30998"/>
            Supreme Being Whose goodness and patience they scorned and <lb n="30999"/>
            slighted but Whose justice and power they cannot evade.<lb n="31000"/> </said>
             <said who="Father Arnall">―The next spiritual pain to which the damned are subjected is <lb n="31001"/>
            the pain of extension. Man, in this earthly life, though he be <lb n="31002"/>
            capable of many evils, is not capable of them all at once inas- <lb n="31003"/>
            much as one evil corrects and counteracts  another just as one <lb n="31004"/>
            poison frequently corrects another. In hell on the contrary one <lb n="31005"/>
            torment, instead of counteracting another, lends it still greater <lb n="31006"/>
            force: and moreover as the internal faculties are more perfect <lb n="31007"/>
            than the external senses so are they more capable of suffering. <lb n="31008"/>
            Just as every sense is afflicted with a fitting torment so is every <lb n="31009"/>
            spiritual faculty; the fancy with horrible images, the sensitive <lb n="31010"/>
            faculty with alternate longing and rage, the mind and under- <lb n="31011"/>
            standing with an interior darkness more terrible even than the <lb n="31012"/>
            exterior darkness which reigns in that dreadful prison. The <lb n="31013"/>
            malice, impotent though it be, which possesses these demon <lb n="31014"/>
            souls is an evil of boundless extension, of limitless duration, a <lb n="31015"/>
            frightful state of wickedness which we can scarcely realise <lb n="31016"/>
            unless we bear in mind the enormity of sin and the hatred God <lb n="31017"/>
            bears to it.<lb n="31018"/> </said>
             <said who="Father Arnall">―Opposed to this pain of extension and yet coexistent with it <lb n="31019"/>
            we have the pain of intensity. Hell is the centre of all evils and, <lb n="31020"/>
            as you know, things are more intense at their centres than at <lb n="31021"/>
            their remotest points. There are no contraries or admixtures of <lb n="31022"/>
            any kind to temper or soften in the least the pains of hell. Nay, <lb n="31023"/>
            things which are good in themselves become evil in hell. Com- <lb n="31024"/>
            pany, elsewhere a source of comfort to the afflicted, will be <lb n="31025"/>
            there a continual torment: knowledge, so much longed for as <lb n="31026"/>
            the chief good of the intellect, will there be hated worse than <lb n="31027"/>
            ignorance: light, so much coveted by all creatures from the lord <lb n="31028"/>
            of creation down to the humblest plant in the forest, will be <lb n="31029"/>
            loathed intensely. In this life our sorrows are either not very <lb n="31030"/>
            long or not very great because nature either overcomes them by <lb n="31031"/>
            habits or puts an end to them by sinking under their weight. <lb n="31032"/>
            But in hell the torments cannot be overcome by habit for while <lb n="31033"/>
            they are of terrible intensity they are at the same time of con- <lb n="31034"/>
            tinual variety, each pain, so to speak, taking fire from another <lb n="31035"/>
            and reendowing that which has enkindled it with a still fiercer <lb n="31036"/>
            flame. Nor can nature escape from these intense and various <lb n="31037"/>
            tortures by succumbing to them for the soul in hell is sustained <lb n="31038"/>
            and maintained in evil so that its suffering may be the greater. <lb n="31039"/>
            Boundless extension of torment, incredible intensity of suffer- <lb n="31040"/>
            ing, unceasing variety of torture – this is what the divine <lb n="31041"/>
            majesty, so outraged by sinners, demands, this is what the <lb n="31042"/>
            holiness of heaven, slighted and set aside for the lustful and low <lb n="31043"/>
            pleasures of the corrupt flesh, requires, this is what the blood <lb n="31044"/>
            of the innocent Lamb of God, shed for the redemption of <lb n="31045"/>
            sinners, trampled upon by the vilest of the vile, insists upon.<lb n="31046"/> </said>
             <said who="Father Arnall">―Last and crowning torture of all the tortures of that awful <lb n="31047"/>
            place is the eternity of hell. Eternity! O dread and dire word. <lb n="31048"/>
            Eternity! What mind of man can understand it? And, remem- <lb n="31049"/>
            ber, it is an eternity of pain. Even though the pains of hell were <lb n="31050"/>
            not so terrible as they are yet they would become infinite as <lb n="31051"/>
            they are destined to last for ever. But while they are everlasting <lb n="31052"/>
            they are at the same time, as you know, intolerably intense, <lb n="31053"/>
            unbearably extensive. To bear even the sting of an insect for  all <lb n="31054"/>
            eternity would be a dreadful torment. What must it be then to <lb n="31055"/>
            bear the manifold tortures of hell for ever. For ever! For all <lb n="31056"/>
            eternity! Not for a year or for an age but for ever. Try to <lb n="31057"/>
            imagine the awful meaning of this. You have often seen the <lb n="31058"/>
            sand on the seashore. How fine are its tiny grains! And how <lb n="31059"/>
            many of those tiny little grains go to make up the small handful <lb n="31060"/>
            which a child grasps in its play. Now imagine a mountain of <lb n="31061"/>
            that sand, a million miles high, reaching from the earth to the <lb n="31062"/>
            farthest heavens, and a million miles broad, extending to re- <lb n="31063"/>
            motest space, and a million miles in thickness: and imagine <lb n="31064"/>
            such an enormous mass of countless particles of sand multi- <lb n="31065"/>
            plied as often as there are leaves in the forest, drops of water in <lb n="31066"/>
            the mighty ocean, feathers on birds, scales on fish, hairs on <lb n="31067"/>
            animals, atoms in the vast expanse of the air: and imagine that <lb n="31068"/>
            at the end of every million years a little bird came to that <lb n="31069"/>
            mountain and carried away in its beak a tiny grain of that sand. <lb n="31070"/>
            How many millions upon millions of centuries would pass be- <lb n="31071"/>
            fore that bird had carried away even a square foot of that <lb n="31072"/>
            mountain, how many eons upon eons of ages before it had <lb n="31073"/>
            carried away all. Yet at the end of that immense stretch of time <lb n="31074"/>
            not even one instant of eternity could be said to have ended. At <lb n="31075"/>
            the end of all those billions and trillions of years eternity would <lb n="31076"/>
            have scarcely begun. And if that mountain rose again after it <lb n="31077"/>
            had been all carried away and if the bird came again and <lb n="31078"/>
            carried it all away again grain by grain: and if it so rose and <lb n="31079"/>
            sank as many times as there are stars in the sky, atoms in the <lb n="31080"/>
            air, drops of water in the sea, leaves on the trees, feathers upon <lb n="31081"/>
            birds, scales upon fish, hairs upon animals, at the end of all <lb n="31082"/>
            those innumerable risings and sinkings of that immeasurably <lb n="31083"/>
            vast mountain not one single instant of eternity could be said to <lb n="31084"/>
            have ended: even then, at the end of such a period, after that <lb n="31085"/>
            eon of time the mere thought of which makes our very brain <lb n="31086"/>
            reel dizzily, eternity would have scarcely begun.<lb n="31087"/> </said>
             <said who="Father Arnall">―A holy saint (one of our own fathers I believe it was) was <lb n="31088"/>
            once vouchsafed a vision of hell. It seemed to him that he stood <lb n="31089"/>
            in the midst of a great hall, dark and silent save for the ticking <lb n="31090"/>
            of a great clock. The ticking went on unceasingly; and it <lb n="31091"/>
            seemed to this saint that the sound of the ticking was the <lb n="31092"/>
            ceaseless repetition of the words: ever, never; ever, never. Ever <lb n="31093"/>
            to be in hell, never to be in heaven; ever to be shut off from the <lb n="31094"/>
            presence of God, never to enjoy the beatific vision; ever to be <lb n="31095"/>
            eaten with flames, gnawed by vermin, goaded with burning <lb n="31096"/>
            spikes, never to be free from those pains; ever to have the <lb n="31097"/>
            conscience upbraid one, the memory enrage, the mind filled <lb n="31098"/>
            with darkness and despair, never to escape; ever to curse and <lb n="31099"/>
            revile the foul demons who gloat fiendishly over the misery of <lb n="31100"/>
            their dupes, never to behold the shining raiment of the blessed <lb n="31101"/>
            spirits; ever to cry out of the abyss of fire to God for an instant, <lb n="31102"/>
            a single instant, of respite from such awful agony, never to <lb n="31103"/>
            receive, even for an instant, God's pardon; ever to suffer, never <lb n="31104"/>
            to enjoy; ever to be damned, never to be saved; ever, never; <lb n="31105"/>
            ever, never. O what a dreadful punishment! An eternity of <lb n="31106"/>
            endless agony, of endless bodily and spiritual torment, without <lb n="31107"/>
            one ray of hope, without one moment of cessation, of agony <lb n="31108"/>
            limitless in extent, limitless in intensity, of torment infinitely <lb n="31109"/>
            lasting, infinitely varied, of torture that sustains eternally that <lb n="31110"/>
            which it eternally devours, of anguish that everlastingly preys <lb n="31111"/>
            upon the spirit while it racks the flesh, an eternity, every instant <lb n="31112"/>
            of which is itself an eternity, and that eternity an eternity of <lb n="31113"/>
            woe. Such is the terrible punishment decreed for those who die <lb n="31114"/>
            in mortal sin by an almighty and a just God.<lb n="31115"/> </said>
             <said who="Father Arnall">―Yes, a just God! Men, reasoning always as men, are aston- <lb n="31116"/>
            ished that God should mete out an everlasting and infinite pun- <lb n="31117"/>
            ishment in the fires of hell for a single grievous sin. They <lb n="31118"/>
            reason thus because, blinded by the gross illusion of the flesh <lb n="31119"/>
            and the darkness of human understanding, they are unable to <lb n="31120"/>
            comprehend the hideous malice of mortal sin. They reason thus <lb n="31121"/>
            because they are unable to comprehend that even venial sin is <lb n="31122"/>
            of such a foul and hideous nature that even if the omnipotent <lb n="31123"/>
            Creator could end all the evil and misery in the world, the <lb n="31124"/>
            wars, the diseases, the robberies, the crimes, the deaths, the <lb n="31125"/>
            murders, on condition that He allowed a single venial sin to <lb n="31126"/>
            pass unpunished, a single venial sin, a lie, an angry look, a <lb n="31127"/>
            moment of wilful sloth, He, the great omnipotent God could <lb n="31128"/>
            not do so because sin, be it in thought or deed, is a trans- <lb n="31129"/>
            gression of His law and God would not be God if He did not <lb n="31130"/>
            punish the transgressor.<lb n="31131"/> </said>
             <said who="Father Arnall">―A sin, an instant of rebellious pride of the intellect, made <lb n="31132"/>
            Lucifer and a third part of the cohorts of angels fall from their <lb n="31133"/>
            glory. A sin, an instant of folly and weakness, drove Adam and <lb n="31134"/>
            Eve out of Eden and brought death and suffering into the <lb n="31135"/>
            world. To retrieve the consequences of that sin the onlybegot- <lb n="31136"/>

            died a most painful death, hanging for three hours on the cross.<lb n="31138"/> </said>
             <said who="Father Arnall">―O, my dear little brethren in Christ Jesus, will we then <lb n="31139"/>
            offend that good Redeemer and provoke His anger? Will we <lb n="31140"/>
            trample again upon that torn and mangled corpse? Will we spit <lb n="31141"/>
            upon that face so full of sorrow and love? Will we too, like the <lb n="31142"/>
            cruel jews and the brutal soldiers, mock that gentle and com- <lb n="31143"/>
            passionate Saviour Who trod alone for our sakes the awful <lb n="31144"/>
            winepress of sorrow? Every word of sin is a wound in His <lb n="31145"/>
            tender side. Every sinful act is a thorn piercing His head. Every <lb n="31146"/>
            impure thought, deliberately yielded to, is a keen lance trans- <lb n="31147"/>
            fixing that sacred and loving heart. No, no. It is impossible for <lb n="31148"/>
            any human being to do that which offends so deeply the divine <lb n="31149"/>
            majesty, that which is punished by an eternity of agony, that <lb n="31150"/>
            which crucifies again the Son of God and makes a mockery of <lb n="31151"/>
            Him.<lb n="31152"/> </said>
             <said who="Father Arnall">―I pray to God that my poor words may have availed today to <lb n="31153"/>
            confirm in holiness those who are in a state of grace, to <lb n="31154"/>
            strengthen the wavering, to lead back to the state of grace the <lb n="31155"/>
            poor soul that has strayed if any such be among you. I pray to <lb n="31156"/>
            God, and do you pray with me, that we may repent of our sins. <lb n="31157"/>
            I will ask you now, all of you, to repeat after me the act of <lb n="31158"/>
            contrition, kneeling here in this humble chapel in the presence <lb n="31159"/>
            of God. He is there in the tabernacle burning with love for <lb n="31160"/>
            mankind, ready to comfort the afflicted. Be not afraid. No <lb n="31161"/>
            matter how many or how foul the sins if only you repent of <lb n="31162"/>
            them they will be forgiven you. Let no worldly shame hold you <lb n="31163"/>
            back. God is still the merciful Lord Who wishes not the eternal <lb n="31164"/>
            death of the sinner but rather that he be converted and live.<lb n="31165"/> </said>
             <said who="Father Arnall">―He calls you to Him. You are His. He made you out of <lb n="31166"/>
            nothing. He loved you as only a God can love. His arms are <lb n="31167"/>
            open to receive you even though you have sinned against Him. <lb n="31168"/>
            Come to Him, poor sinner, poor vain and erring sinner. Now is <lb n="31169"/>
            the acceptable time. Now is the hour.<lb n="31170"/></said> </p>
            <p> The priest rose and turning towards the altar knelt upon the <lb n="31171"/>
            step before the tabernacle in the fallen gloom. He waited till all <lb n="31172"/>
            in the chapel had knelt and every least noise was still. Then <lb n="31173"/>
            raising his head he repeated the act of contrition, phrase by <lb n="31174"/>
            phrase, with fervour. The boys answered him phrase by phrase. <lb n="31175"/>
            Stephen, his tongue cleaving to his palate, bowed his head, <lb n="31176"/>
            praying with his heart.<lb n="31177"/> </p>

            <p> He  went up to his room after dinner in order to be alone <lb n="31202"/>
            with his soul: and at every step his soul seemed  to sigh: at every <lb n="31203"/>
            step his soul mounted with his feet, sighing in the ascent, <lb n="31204"/>
            through a region of viscid gloom.<lb n="31205"/> </p>
            <p> He halted on the landing before the door  and then, grasping <lb n="31206"/>
            the porcelain knob, opened the door quickly. He waited in fear, <lb n="31207"/>
            his soul pining within him, praying silently that death might <lb n="31208"/>
            not touch his brow as he passed over the threshold,  that the <lb n="31209"/>
            fiends that inhabit darkness might not be given power over <lb n="31210"/>
            him. He waited still at the threshold  as at the entrance to some <lb n="31211"/>
            dark cave. Faces were there; eyes: they waited and watched. <lb n="31212"/>
             <said who="murmuring faces">―We knew perfectly well of course that though it was bound <lb n="31213"/>
            to come to the light he would find considerable difficulty in <lb n="31214"/>
            endeavouring to try to induce himself to try to endeavour to <lb n="31215"/>
            ascertain the spiritual plenipotentiary and so we knew of <lb n="31216"/>
            course perfectly well—<lb n="31217"/></said> </p>
            <p> Murmuring faces waited and watched;  murmurous voices <lb n="31218"/>
            filled the dark shell of the cave. He feared intensely in spirit <lb n="31219"/>
            and in flesh but, raising his head bravely, he strode into the <lb n="31220"/>
            room firmly. A doorway, a room, the same room, same win- <lb n="31221"/>
            dow. He told himself calmly that those words had absolutely <lb n="31222"/>
            no sense which had seemed to rise murmurously from the dark. <lb n="31223"/>
            He told himself that it was simply his room with the door <lb n="31224"/>
            open.<lb n="31225"/> </p>
            <p> He closed the door and, walking swiftly to the bed, knelt <lb n="31226"/>
            beside it and covered his face with his hands. His hands were <lb n="31227"/>
            cold and damp and his limbs ached with chill. Bodily unrest <lb n="31228"/>
            and chill and weariness beset him, routing his thoughts. Why <lb n="31229"/>
            was he kneeling there like a child saying his evening prayers? <lb n="31230"/>
            To be alone with his soul, to examine his conscience, to meet <lb n="31231"/>
            his sins face to face, to recall their times and manners and <lb n="31232"/>
            circumstances, to weep over them. He could not weep. He <lb n="31233"/>
            could not summon them to his memory. He felt only an ache of <lb n="31234"/>
            soul and body, his whole being, memory, will, understanding, <lb n="31235"/>
            flesh, benumbed and weary.<lb n="31236"/> </p>
            <p> That was the work of devils, to scatter his thoughts and <lb n="31237"/>
            overcloud his conscience, assailing him at the gates of the cow- <lb n="31238"/>
            ardly and sincorrupted flesh: and, praying God timidly to <lb n="31239"/>
            forgive him his weakness, he crawled up on to the bed and, <lb n="31240"/>
            wrapping the blankets closely about him, covered his face again <lb n="31241"/>
            with his hands. He had  sinned. He had sinned so deeply against <lb n="31242"/>
            heaven and before God that he was not worthy to be called <lb n="31243"/>
            God's child.<lb n="31244"/> </p>
            <p> Could it be that he, Stephen Dedalus, had done those things? <lb n="31245"/>
            His conscience sighed in answer. Yes, he had done them, se- <lb n="31246"/>
            cretly, filthily, time after time, and, hardened in sinful impeni- <lb n="31247"/>
            tence, he had dared to wear the mask of holiness before the <lb n="31248"/>
            tabernacle itself while his soul within was a living mass of <lb n="31249"/>
            corruption. How came it that God had not struck him dead? <lb n="31250"/>
            The leprous company of his sins closed about him, breathing <lb n="31251"/>
            upon him, bending over him from all sides. He strove to forget <lb n="31252"/>
            them in an act of prayer, huddling his limbs closer  together and <lb n="31253"/>
            binding down his eyelids: but the senses of the soul would not <lb n="31254"/>
            be bound and, though his eyes were shut fast, he saw the places <lb n="31255"/>
            where he had sinned and, though his ears were tightly covered, <lb n="31256"/>
            he heard. He desired with all his will not to hear or see. He <lb n="31257"/>
            desired till his frame shook under the strain of his desire and <lb n="31258"/>
            until the senses of his soul closed. They closed for an instant <lb n="31259"/>
            and then opened. He saw.<lb n="31260"/> </p>
            <p> A field of stiff weeds and thistles and tufted nettlebunches. <lb n="31261"/>
            Thick among the tufts of rank stiff growth lay battered canis- <lb n="31262"/>
            ters and clots and coils of solid excrement. A faint marshlight <lb n="31263"/>
            struggled upwards from all the ordure through the bristling <lb n="31264"/>
            greygreen weeds. An evil smell, faint and foul as the light, <lb n="31265"/>
            curled upwards sluggishly out of the canisters and from the <lb n="31266"/>
            stale crusted dung.<lb n="31267"/> </p>
            <p> Creatures were in the field; one, three, six: creatures were <lb n="31268"/>
            moving in the field, hither and thither. Goatish creatures with <lb n="31269"/>
            human faces, hornybrowed, lightly bearded and grey as india- <lb n="31270"/>
            rubber. The malice of evil glittered in their hard eyes, as they <lb n="31271"/>
            moved hither and thither, trailing their long tails behind them. <lb n="31272"/>
            A rictus of cruel malignity lit up greyly their old bony faces. <lb n="31273"/>
            One was clasping about his ribs a torn flannel waistcoat, an- <lb n="31274"/>
            other complained monotonously as his beard stuck in the <lb n="31275"/>
            tufted weeds. Soft language issued from their spittleless lips as <lb n="31276"/>
            they swished in slow circles round and round the field, winding <lb n="31277"/>
            hither and thither through the weeds, dragging their long tails <lb n="31278"/>
            amid the rattling canisters. They moved in slow circles, circling <lb n="31279"/>
            closer and closer, to enclose, to  enclose, soft language issuing <lb n="31280"/>
            from their lips, their long swishing tails  besmeared with stale <lb n="31281"/>
            shite, thrusting upwards their terrific faces .....<lb n="31282"/> </p>
            <p> Help!<lb n="31283"/> </p>
            <p> He flung the blankets from him madly to free his face and <lb n="31284"/>
            neck. That was his hell. God had allowed him to see the hell <lb n="31285"/>
            reserved for his sins: stinking, bestial, malignant, a hell of lech- <lb n="31286"/>
            erous goatish fiends. For him! For him!<lb n="31287"/> </p>
            <p> He sprang from the bed, the reeking odour pouring down <lb n="31288"/>
            his throat, clogging and revolting his entrails. Air! The air of <lb n="31289"/>
            heaven! He stumbled towards the window, groaning and al- <lb n="31290"/>
            most fainting with sickness. At the washstand a convulsion <lb n="31291"/>
            seized him within: and, clasping his cold forehead wildly, he <lb n="31292"/>
            vomited profusely in agony.<lb n="31293"/> </p>
            <p> When the fit had spent itself he walked weakly to the win- <lb n="31294"/>
            dow and, lifting the sash, sat in a corner of the embrasure and <lb n="31295"/>
            leaned his elbow upon the sill. The rain had drawn off; and <lb n="31296"/>
            amid the moving vapours from point to point of light the city <lb n="31297"/>
            was spinning about herself a soft cocoon of yellowish haze. <lb n="31298"/>
            Heaven was still and faintly luminous and the air sweet to <lb n="31299"/>
            breathe, as in a thicket drenched with showers: and amid peace <lb n="31300"/>
            and shimmering lights and quiet fragrances he made a covenant <lb n="31301"/>
            with his heart.<lb n="31302"/> </p>
            <p> He prayed: <lb n="31303"/>
             <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―<emph>He once had meant to come on earth in heavenly glory but <lb n="31304"/>
            we sinned: and then He could not safely visit us but with a <lb n="31305"/>
            shrouded majesty and a bedimmed radiance for He was God. <lb n="31306"/>
            So He came Himself in weakness not in power and He sent <lb n="31307"/>
            thee, a creature in His stead, with a creature's comeliness and <lb n="31308"/>
            lustre suited to our state. And now thy very face and form, dear <lb n="31309"/>
            mother, speak to us of the Eternal; not like earthly beauty, <lb n="31310"/>
            dangerous to look upon, but like the morning star which is thy <lb n="31311"/>
            emblem, bright and musical, breathing purity, telling of heaven <lb n="31312"/>
            and infusing peace. O harbinger of day! O light of the pilgrim! <lb n="31313"/>
            Lead us still as thou hast led. In the dark night, across the bleak <lb n="31314"/>
            wilderness guide us on to our Lord Jesus, guide us home.</emph><lb n="31315"/></said> </p>
            <p>His eyes were dimmed with tears and, looking humbly up to <lb n="31316"/>
            heaven, he wept for the innocence he had lost.<lb n="31317"/> </p>
            <p> When evening had fallen he left the house and the first touch <lb n="31318"/>
            of the damp dark air and the noise of the door as it closed <lb n="31319"/>
            behind him made ache again his conscience, lulled by prayer <lb n="31320"/>
            and tears. Confess! Confess! It was not enough to lull the con- <lb n="31321"/>
            science with a tear and a prayer. He had to kneel before the <lb n="31322"/>
            minister of the Holy Ghost and tell over his hidden sins truly <lb n="31323"/>
            and repentantly. Before he heard again the footboard of the <lb n="31324"/>
            housedoor trail over the threshold  as it opened to let him in, <lb n="31325"/>
            before he saw again the table in the kitchen set for supper he <lb n="31326"/>
            would have knelt and confessed. It was quite simple.<lb n="31327"/> </p>
            <p> The ache of conscience ceased and he walked onward swiftly <lb n="31328"/>
            through the dark streets. There were so many flagstones on the <lb n="31329"/>
            footpath of that street and so many streets in that city and so <lb n="31330"/>
            many cities in the world. Yet eternity had no end. He was in <lb n="31331"/>
            mortal sin. Even once was a mortal sin. It could happen in an <lb n="31332"/>
            instant. But how so quickly? By seeing or by thinking of seeing. <lb n="31333"/>
            The eyes see the thing, without having wished first to see. Then <lb n="31334"/>
            in an instant it happens. But does that part of the body under- <lb n="31335"/>
            stand or what? The serpent, the most subtle beast of the field. <lb n="31336"/>
            It must understand when it desires in one instant and then <lb n="31337"/>
            prolongs its own desire instant after instant, sinfully. It feels <lb n="31338"/>
            and understands and desires. What a horrible thing! Who made <lb n="31339"/>
            it to be like that, a bestial part of the body able to understand <lb n="31340"/>
            bestially and desire bestially? Was that then he or an inhuman <lb n="31341"/>
            thing moved by a lower soul than his soul? His soul sickened at <lb n="31342"/>
            the thought of a torpid snaky life feeding itself out of the tender <lb n="31343"/>
            marrow of his life and fattening upon the slime of lust. O why <lb n="31344"/>
            was that so? O why?<lb n="31345"/> </p>
            <p> He cowered in the shadow of the thought, abasing himself in <lb n="31346"/>
            the awe of God  Who had made all things and all men. Mad- <lb n="31347"/>
            ness. Who could think such a thought? And, cowering in <lb n="31348"/>
            darkness and abject, he prayed mutely to his angel guardian to <lb n="31349"/>
            drive away with his sword the demon that was whispering to <lb n="31350"/>
            his brain.<lb n="31351"/> </p>
            <p> The whisper ceased and he knew then clearly that his own <lb n="31352"/>
            soul had sinned in thought and word and deed wilfully through <lb n="31353"/>
            his own body. Confess! He had to confess every sin. How could <lb n="31354"/>
            he utter in words to the priest what he had done? Must, must. <lb n="31355"/>
            Or how could he explain without dying of shame? Or how <lb n="31356"/>
            could he have done such things without shame? A madman, a <lb n="31357"/>
            loathsome madman! Confess! O he would indeed to be free and <lb n="31358"/>
            sinless again! Perhaps the priest would know. O dear God!<lb n="31359"/> </p>
            <p> He walked on and on through illlit  streets, fearing to stand <lb n="31360"/>
            still for a moment lest it might seem that he held back from <lb n="31361"/>
            what awaited him, fearing to arrive at that towards which he <lb n="31362"/>
            still turned with longing. How beautiful must be a soul in the <lb n="31363"/>
            state of grace when God looked upon it with love!<lb n="31364"/> </p>
            <p> Frowsy girls sat along the curbstones before their baskets. <lb n="31365"/>
            Their dank hair hung trailed  over their brows. They were not <lb n="31366"/>
            beautiful to see as they crouched in the mire. But their souls <lb n="31367"/>
            were seen by God; and if their souls were in a state of grace <lb n="31368"/>
            they were radiant to see: and God loved them, seeing them.<lb n="31369"/> </p>
            <p> A wasting breath of humiliation blew bleakly over his soul <lb n="31370"/>
            to think of how he had fallen, to feel that those souls were <lb n="31371"/>
            dearer to God than his. The wind blew over him and passed on <lb n="31372"/>
            to the myriads and myriads of other souls on whom God's <lb n="31373"/>
            favour shone now  more and now less, stars now brighter and <lb n="31374"/>
            now dimmer, sustained  and failing. And the glimmering souls <lb n="31375"/>
            passed away, sustained and failing, merged in a moving breath. <lb n="31376"/>
            One soul was lost; a tiny soul: his. It flickered once and went <lb n="31377"/>
            out, forgotten, lost. The end: black cold void waste.<lb n="31378"/> </p>
            <p> Consciousness of place came ebbing back to him slowly over <lb n="31379"/>
            a vast tract of time unlit, unfelt, unlived. The squalid scene <lb n="31380"/>
            composed itself around him; the common accents, the burning <lb n="31381"/>
            gasjets in the shops, odours of fish and spirits and wet sawdust, <lb n="31382"/>
            moving men and women. An old woman was about to cross <lb n="31383"/>
            the street, an oilcan in her hand. He bent down and asked her <lb n="31384"/>
            was there a chapel near. <lb n="31385"/>
            <said who="an old woman">―A chapel, sir? Yes, sir. Church Street chapel.<lb n="30386"/> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Church?<lb n="31387"/></said> </p>
            <p> She shifted the can to her other hand and directed him: and, <lb n="31388"/>
            as she held out her reeking withered right hand under its fringe <lb n="31389"/>
            of shawl, he bent lower towards her, saddened and soothed by <lb n="31390"/>
            her voice. <lb n="31391"/>
             <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Thank you.<lb n="31392"/> </said>
            <said who="an old woman">―You are quite  welcome, sir.<lb n="31393"/></said> </p>
            <p> The candles on the high altar had been extinguished but the <lb n="31394"/>
            fragrance of incense still floated down the dim nave. Bearded <lb n="31395"/>
            workmen with pious faces were guiding a canopy out through <lb n="31396"/>
            a sidedoor, the sacristan aiding them with quiet gestures and <lb n="31397"/>
            words. A few of the faithful still lingered, praying before one of <lb n="31398"/>
            the sidealtars or kneeling in the benches near the confessionals. <lb n="31399"/>
            He approached timidly and knelt at the last bench in the body, <lb n="31400"/>
            thankful for the peace and silence and fragrant shadow of the <lb n="31401"/>
            church. The board on which he knelt was narrow and worn <lb n="31402"/>
            and those who knelt near him were humble followers of Jesus. <lb n="31403"/>
            Jesus too had been born in poverty and had worked in the shop <lb n="31404"/>
            of a carpenter, cutting boards and planing them, and had first <lb n="31405"/>
            spoken of the kingdom of God to poor fishermen, teaching all <lb n="31406"/>
            men to be meek and humble of heart.<lb n="31407"/> </p>
            <p> He bowed his head upon his hands, bidding his heart be <lb n="31408"/>
            meek and humble that he might be like those who knelt beside <lb n="31409"/>
            him and his prayer as acceptable as theirs. He prayed beside <lb n="31410"/>
            them but it was hard. His soul was foul with sin and he dared <lb n="31411"/>
            not ask forgiveness with the simple trust of those whom Jesus, <lb n="31412"/>
            in the mysterious ways of God, had called first to His side, the <lb n="31413"/>
            carpenters, the fishermen, poor and simple people  following a <lb n="31414"/>
            lowly trade, handling and shaping the wood of trees, mending <lb n="31415"/>
            their nets with patience.<lb n="31416"/> </p>
            <p> A tall figure came down the aisle and the penitents stirred: <lb n="31417"/>
            and, at the last moment glancing up swiftly, he saw a long grey <lb n="31418"/>
            beard and the brown habit of a capuchin. The priest entered <lb n="31419"/>
            the box and was hidden. Two penitents rose and entered the <lb n="31420"/>
            confessional at either side. The wooden slide was drawn back <lb n="31421"/>
            and the faint murmur of a voice troubled the silence.<lb n="31422"/> </p>
            <p> His blood began to murmur in his veins, murmuring like a <lb n="31423"/>
            sinful city summoned from its sleep to hear its doom. Little <lb n="31424"/>
            flakes of fire fell and powdery ashes fell softly, alighting on the <lb n="31425"/>
            houses of men. They stirred, waking from sleep, troubled by <lb n="31426"/>
            the heated air.<lb n="31427"/> </p>
            <p> The slide was shot back. The penitent emerged from the side <lb n="31428"/>
            of the box. The farther slide was drawn. A woman entered <lb n="31429"/>
            quietly and deftly where the first penitent had knelt. The faint <lb n="31430"/>
            murmur began again.<lb n="31431"/> </p>
            <p> He could still leave the chapel. He could stand up, put one <lb n="31432"/>
            foot before the other and walk out softly and then run, run, run <lb n="31433"/>
            swiftly through the dark streets. He could still escape from the <lb n="31434"/>
            shame. O what shame! His face was burning with shame. Had <lb n="31435"/>
            it been any terrible crime but that one sin! Had it been murder! <lb n="31436"/>
            Little fiery flakes fell and touched him at all points, shameful <lb n="31437"/>
            thoughts, shameful words, shameful acts. Shame covered him <lb n="31438"/>
            wholly like fine glowing ashes falling continually. To say it in <lb n="31439"/>
            words! His soul, stifling and helpless, would cease to be.<lb n="31440"/> </p>
            <p> The slide was shot back. A penitent emerged from the far- <lb n="31441"/>
            ther side of the box. The near slide was drawn. A penitent <lb n="31442"/>
            entered where the other penitent had come out. A soft whisper- <lb n="31443"/>
            ing noise floated in vaporous cloudlets out of the box. It was <lb n="31444"/>
            the woman: soft whispering cloudlets, soft whispering vapour, <lb n="31445"/>
            whispering and vanishing.<lb n="31446"/> </p>
            <p> He beat his breast with his fist humbly, secretly under cover <lb n="31447"/>
            of the wooden armrest. He would be at one with others and <lb n="31448"/>
            with God. He would love his neighbour. He would love God <lb n="31449"/>
            Who had made and loved him. He would kneel and pray with <lb n="31450"/>
            others and be happy. God would look down on him and on <lb n="31451"/>
            them and would love them all.<lb n="31452"/> </p>
            <p> It was easy to be good. God's yoke was sweet and light. It <lb n="31453"/>
            was better never to have sinned, to have remained always a <lb n="31454"/>
            child, for God loved little children and suffered them to come <lb n="31455"/>
            to Him. It was a terrible and a sad thing to sin. But God was <lb n="31456"/>
            merciful to poor sinners who were truly sorry. How true that <lb n="31457"/>
            was! That was indeed goodness.<lb n="31458"/> </p>
            <p> The slide was shot to suddenly. The penitent came out. He <lb n="31459"/>
            was next. He stood up in terror and walked blindly into the <lb n="31460"/>
            box.<lb n="31461"/> </p>
            <p> At last it had come. He knelt in the silent gloom and raised <lb n="31462"/>
            his eyes to the white crucifix suspended above him. God could <lb n="31463"/>
            see that he was sorry. He would tell all his sins. His confession <lb n="31464"/>
            would be long, long. Everybody in the chapel would know then <lb n="31465"/>
            what a sinner he had been. Let them know. It was true. But <lb n="31466"/>
            God had promised to forgive him if he was sorry. He was <lb n="31467"/>
            sorry. He clasped his hands and raised them towards the white <lb n="31468"/>
            form, praying with his darkened eyes, praying with all his <lb n="31469"/>
            trembling body, swaying his head to and fro like a lost crea- <lb n="31470"/>
            ture, praying with whimpering lips. <lb n="31471"/>
             <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Sorry! Sorry! O sorry!<lb n="31472"/></said> </p>
            <p> The slide clicked back and his heart bounded in his breast. <lb n="31473"/>
            The face of an old priest was at the grating, averted from him, <lb n="31474"/>
            leaning upon a hand. He made the sign of the cross and prayed <lb n="31475"/>
            of the priest to bless him for he had sinned. Then, bowing his <lb n="31476"/>
            head, he repeated the <seg xml:lang="la">Confiteor</seg> in fright. At the words <emph>my</emph> <lb n="31477"/>
            <emph>most grievous fault</emph> he ceased, breathless. <lb n="31478"/>
            <said who="Priest">―How long is it since your last confession, my child?<lb n="31479"/> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―A long time, father.<lb n="31480"/> </said>
            <said who="Priest">―A month, my child?<lb n="31481"/> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">Longer, father.<lb n="31482"/> </said>
            <said who="Priest">Three months, my child?<lb n="31483"/> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Longer, father.<lb n="31484"/> </said>
            <said who="Priest">―Six months?<lb n="31485"/> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Eight months, father.<lb n="31486"/></said> </p>
            <p> He had begun. The priest asked: <lb n="31487"/>
            <said who="Priest">―And what do you remember since that time?<lb n="31488"/></said> </p>
            <p> He began to confess his sins: masses missed, prayers not <lb n="31489"/>
            said, lies. <lb n="31490"/>
            <said who="Priest">―Anything else, my child?<lb n="31491"/></said> </p>
            <p> Sins of anger, envy of  others, gluttony, vanity, disobedience. <lb n="31492"/>
            <said who="Priest">―Anything else, my child?<lb n="31493"/> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Sloth.<lb n="31494"/> </said>
            <said who="Priest">―Anything else, my child?<lb n="31495"/></said> </p>
            <p> There was no help. He murmured: <lb n="31496"/>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―I .... committed sins of impurity, father.<lb n="31497"/></said> </p>
            <p> The priest did not turn his head. <lb n="31498"/>
            <said who="Priest">―With yourself, my child?<lb n="31499"/> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―And ... with others.<lb n="31500"/> </said>
            <said who="Priest">―With women, my child?<lb n="31501"/> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Yes, father.<lb n="31502"/> </said>
            <said who="Priest">Were they married women, my child?<lb n="31503"/></said> </p>
            <p>He did not know. His sins trickled from his lips, one by one, <lb n="31504"/>
            trickled in shameful drops from his soul festering and oozing <lb n="31505"/>
            like a sore, a squalid stream of vice. The last sins oozed forth, <lb n="31506"/>
            sluggish, filthy. There was no more to tell. He bowed his head, <lb n="31507"/>
            overcome.<lb n="31508"/> </p>
            <p> The priest was silent. Then he asked: <lb n="31509"/>
            <said who="Priest">―How old are you, my child?<lb n="31510"/> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Sixteen, father.<lb n="31511"/></said> </p>
            The priest passed his hand several times over his face. Then, <lb n="31512"/>
            resting his forehead against his hand, he leaned towards the <lb n="31513"/>
            grating and, with eyes still averted, spoke slowly. His voice was <lb n="31514"/>
            weary and old. <lb n="31515"/>
            <said who="Priest">―You are very young, my child, he said, and let me implore of <lb n="31516"/>
            you to give up that sin. It is a terrible sin. It kills the body and <lb n="31517"/>
            it kills the soul. It is the cause of many crimes and misfortunes. <lb n="31518"/>
            Give it up, my child, for God' sake. It is dishonourable and <lb n="31519"/>
            unmanly. You cannot know where that wretched habit will <lb n="31520"/>
            lead you or where it will come against you. As long as you <lb n="31521"/>
            commit that sin, my poor child, you will never be worth one <lb n="31522"/>
            farthing to God. Pray to our mother Mary to help you. She will <lb n="31523"/>
            help you, my child. Pray to Our Blessed Lady when that sin <lb n="31524"/>
            comes into  your mind. I am sure you will do that, will you not? <lb n="31525"/>
            You repent of all those sins. I am sure you do. And you will <lb n="31526"/>
            promise God now that by His holy grace you will never offend <lb n="31527"/>
            Him any more by that wicked sin. You will make that solemn <lb n="31528"/>
            promise to God, will you not?<lb n="31529"/> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Yes, father.<lb n="31530"/> </said>
            <p>The old and weary voice fell like sweet rain upon his quak- <lb n="31531"/>
            ing parching heart. How sweet and sad! <lb n="31532"/>
            <said who="Priest">―Do so, my poor child. The devil has  led you astray. Drive <lb n="31533"/>
            him back to hell when he tempts you to dishonour your body <lb n="31534"/>
            in that way - the foul spirit who hates Our Lord. Promise God <lb n="31535"/>
            now that you will give up that sin, that wretched wretched sin.<lb n="31536"/></said> </p>
            <p>Blinded by his tears and by the light of God's mercifulness <lb n="31537"/>
            he bent his head and heard the grave words of absolution <lb n="31538"/>
            spoken and saw the priest's hand raised above him in token of <lb n="31539"/>
            forgiveness. <lb n="31540"/>
            <said who="Priest">―God bless you, my child. Pray for me.<lb n="31541"/></said> </p>
            <p>He knelt to say his penance, praying in a corner of the dark <lb n="31542"/>
            nave: and his prayers ascended to heaven from his purified <lb n="31543"/>
            heart like perfume streaming upwards from a heart of white <lb n="31544"/>
            rose.<lb n="31545"/> </p>
            <p> The  muddy streets were gay. He strode homeward, con- <lb n="31546"/>
            scious of an  invisible grace pervading and making light his <lb n="31547"/>
            limbs. In spite of all he had done it. He had confessed and God <lb n="31548"/>
            had pardoned him. His soul was made fair and holy once more, <lb n="31549"/>
            holy and happy.<lb n="31550"/> </p>
            <p> It would be beautiful to die if God so willed. It was beautiful <lb n="31551"/>
            to live if God so willed, to live in grace a life of peace and <lb n="31552"/>
            virtue and forbearance with others.<lb n="31553"/> </p>
            <p> He sat by the fire in the kitchen, not daring to speak for <lb n="31554"/>
            happiness. Till that moment he had not known how beautiful <lb n="31555"/>
            and peaceful life could be. The green square of paper pinned <lb n="31556"/>
            round the lamp cast down a tender shade. On the dresser was a <lb n="31557"/>
            plate of sausages and white pudding and on the shelf there were <lb n="31558"/>
            eggs. They would be for the breakfast in the morning after the <lb n="31559"/>
            communion in the college chapel. White pudding and eggs and <lb n="31560"/>
            sausages and cups of tea. How simple and beautiful was life <lb n="31561"/>
            after all! And life lay all before him.<lb n="31562"/> </p>
            <p> In a dream he fell asleep. In a dream he rose and saw that it <lb n="31563"/>
            was morning. In a waking dream he went through the quiet <lb n="31564"/>
            morning towards the college.<lb n="31565"/> </p>
            <p> The boys were all there, kneeling in their places. He knelt <lb n="31566"/>
            among them, happy and shy. The altar was heaped with fra- <lb n="31567"/>
            grant masses of white flowers: and in the morning light the pale <lb n="31568"/>
            flames of the candles among the white flowers were clear and <lb n="31569"/>
            silent as his own soul.<lb n="31570"/> </p>
            <p> He knelt before the altar with his classmates, holding the <lb n="31571"/>
            altar cloth with them over a living rail of hands. His hands <lb n="31572"/>
            were trembling: and his soul trembled as he heard the priest <lb n="31573"/>
            pass with the ciborium from communicant to communicant. <lb n="31574"/>
            <said who="Priest">―<seg xml:lang="la">Corpus Domini nostri.</seg><lb n="31575"/></said> </p>
            <p> Could it be? He knelt there sinless and timid: and he would <lb n="31576"/>
            hold upon his tongue the host and God would enter his purified <lb n="31577"/>
            body. <lb n="31578"/>
            <said who="Priest">―<seg xml:lang="la">In vitam eternam. Amen.</seg><lb n="31579"/></said> </p>
            <p> Another life! A life of grace and virtue and happiness! It was <lb n="31580"/>
            true. It was not a dream from which he would wake.  The past <lb n="31581"/>
            was past. <lb n="31582"/>
            <said who="Priest">―<seg xml:lang="la">Corpus Domini nostri.</seg><lb n="31583"/></said> </p>
            <p> The ciborium had come to him.<lb n="31584"/> </p>

            <p> Sunday was dedicated to the mystery of the Holy Trinity, <lb n="40001"/>
            Monday to the Holy Ghost, Tuesday to the Guardian Angels, <lb n="40002"/>
            Wednesday to Saint Joseph, Thursday to the Most Blessed Sac- <lb n="40003"/>
            rament of the Altar, Friday to the Suffering Jesus, Saturday to <lb n="40004"/>
            the Blessed Virgin Mary.<lb n="40005"/> </p>
            <p> Every morning he hallowed himself anew in the presence of <lb n="40006"/>
            some holy image or mystery. His day began with an heroic <lb n="40007"/>
            offering of its every moment of thought or action for the intentions <lb n="40008"/>
            tions of the sovereign pontiff and with an early mass. The raw <lb n="40009"/>
            morning air whetted his resolute piety; and often as he knelt <lb n="40010"/>
            among the few worshippers at the sidealtar, following with his <lb n="40011"/>
            interleaved prayerbook the murmur of the priest, he glanced up <lb n="40012"/>
            for an instant towards the vested figure standing in the gloom <lb n="40013"/>
            between the two candles which were the old and the new <lb n="40014"/>
            testaments and imagined that he was kneeling at mass in the <lb n="40015"/>
            catacombs.<lb n="40016"/> </p>
            <p> His daily life was laid out in devotional areas. By means of <lb n="40017"/>
            ejaculations and prayers he stored up ungrudgingly for the <lb n="40018"/>
            souls in purgatory centuries of days and quarantines and years; <lb n="40019"/>
            yet the spiritual triumph which he felt in achieving with ease so <lb n="40020"/>
            many fabulous ages of canonical penances did not wholly re- <lb n="40021"/>
            ward his zeal of prayer since he could never know how much <lb n="40022"/>
            temporal punishment he had remitted by way of suffrage for <lb n="40023"/>
            the agonising souls: and, fearful lest in the midst of the purga- <lb n="40024"/>
            torial fire, which differed from the infernal only in that it was <lb n="40025"/>
            not everlasting, his penance might avail no more than a drop of <lb n="40026"/>
            moisture, he drove his soul daily through an increasing circle of <lb n="40027"/>
            works of supererogation.<lb n="40028"/> </p>
            <p> Every part of his day, divided by what he regarded now as <lb n="40029"/>
            the duties of his station in life, circled about its own centre of <lb n="40030"/>
            spiritual energy. His life seemed to have drawn near to eternity; <lb n="40031"/>
            every thought, word and deed, every instance of consciousness <lb n="40032"/>
            could be made to revibrate radiantly in heaven: and at times his <lb n="40033"/>
            sense of such immediate repercussion was so lively that he <lb n="40034"/>
            seemed to feel his soul in devotion pressing like fingers the <lb n="40035"/>
            keyboard of a great cash register and to see the amount of his <lb n="40036"/>
            purchase start forth immediately in heaven, not as a number but <lb n="40037"/>
            as a frail column of incense or as a slender flower.<lb n="40038"/> </p>
            <p> The rosaries too which he said constantly - for he carried his <lb n="40039"/>
            beads loose in his trousers' pockets that he might tell them as <lb n="40040"/>
            he walked the streets - transformed themselves into coronals of <lb n="40041"/>
            flowers of such vague unearthly texture that they seemed to <lb n="40042"/>
            him as hueless and odourless as they were nameless. He offered <lb n="40043"/>
            up each of his three daily chaplets that his soul might grow <lb n="40044"/>
            strong in each of the three theological virtues, in faith in the <lb n="40045"/>
            Father Who had created him, in hope in the Son Who had <lb n="40046"/>
            redeemed him, and in love of the Holy Ghost Who had sanc- <lb n="40047"/>
            tified him, and this thrice triple prayer he offered to the Three <lb n="40048"/>
            Persons through Mary in the name of her joyful and sorrowful <lb n="40049"/>
            and glorious  mysteries.<lb n="40050"/> </p>
            <p> On each of the seven days of the week he further prayed that <lb n="40051"/>
            one of the seven gifts of the Holy Ghost might descend upon <lb n="40052"/>
            his soul and drive out of it day by day the seven deadly sins <lb n="40053"/>
            which had defiled it in the past; and he prayed for each gift on <lb n="40054"/>
            its appointed day, confident that it would descend upon him, <lb n="40055"/>
            though it seemed strange to him at times that wisdom and <lb n="40056"/>
            understanding and knowledge were so distinct in their nature <lb n="40057"/>
            that each should be prayed for apart from the others. Yet he <lb n="40058"/>
            believed that at some future stage of his spiritual progress this <lb n="40059"/>
            difficulty would be removed when his sinful soul had been <lb n="40060"/>
            raised up from its weakness and enlightened by the Third Person <lb n="40061"/>
            son of the Most Blessed Trinity. He believed this all the more, <lb n="40062"/>
            and with trepidation, because of the divine gloom and silence <lb n="40063"/>
            wherein dwelt the unseen Paraclete, Whose symbols were a <lb n="40064"/>
            dove and a mighty wind, to sin against Whom was a sin be- <lb n="40065"/>
            yond forgiveness, the eternal, mysterious secret Being to <lb n="40066"/>
            Whom, as God, the priests offered up mass once a year, robed <lb n="40067"/>
            in the scarlet of the tongues of fire.<lb n="40068"/> </p>
            <p> The imagery through which the nature and kinship of the <lb n="40069"/>
            Three Persons of the Trinity were darkly shadowed forth in the <lb n="40070"/>
            books of devotion which he read - the Father contemplating <lb n="40071"/>
            from all eternity as in a mirror His Divine Perfections and <lb n="40072"/>
            thereby begetting eternally the Eternal Son and the Holy Spirit <lb n="40073"/>
            proceeding out of Father and Son from all eternity - were easier <lb n="40074"/>
            of acceptance by his mind by reason of their august incompre- <lb n="40075"/>
            hensibility than was the simple fact that God had loved his soul <lb n="40076"/>
            from all eternity, for ages before he had been born into the <lb n="40077"/>
            world, for ages before the world itself had existed. He had <lb n="40078"/>
            heard the names of the passions of love and hate pronounced <lb n="40079"/>
            solemnly on the stage and in the pulpit, had found them set <lb n="40080"/>
            forth solemnly in books, and had wondered why his soul was <lb n="40081"/>
            unable to harbour them for any time or to force his lips to utter <lb n="40082"/>
            their names with conviction. A brief anger had often invested <lb n="40083"/>
            him but he had never been able to make it an abiding passion <lb n="40084"/>
            and had always felt himself passing out of it as if his very body <lb n="40085"/>
            were being divested with ease of some outer skin or peel. He <lb n="40086"/>
            had felt a subtle, dark and murmurous presence penetrate his <lb n="40087"/>
            being and fire him with a brief iniquitous lust: it too had <lb n="40088"/>
            slipped beyond his grasp leaving his mind lucid and indifferent. <lb n="40089"/>
            This, it seemed, was the only love and that the only hate his <lb n="40090"/>
            soul would harbour.<lb n="40091"/> </p>
            <p> But he could no longer disbelieve in the reality of love since <lb n="40092"/>
            God Himself had loved his individual soul with divine love <lb n="40093"/>
            from all eternity. Gradually, as his soul was enriched with <lb n="40094"/>
            spiritual knowledge, he saw the whole world forming one vast <lb n="40095"/>
            symmetrical expression of God's power and love. Life became a <lb n="40096"/>
            divine gift for every moment and sensation of which, were it <lb n="40097"/>
            even the sight of a single leaf hanging on the twig of a tree, his <lb n="40098"/>
            soul should praise and thank the Giver. The world for all its <lb n="40099"/>
            solid substance and complexity no longer existed for his soul <lb n="40100"/>
            save as a theorem of divine power and love and universality. So <lb n="40101"/>
            entire and unquestionable was this sense of the divine meaning <lb n="40102"/>
            in all nature granted to his soul that he could scarcely understand <lb n="40103"/>
            stand why it was in any way necessary that he should continue <lb n="40104"/>
            to live. Yet that was part of the divine purpose and he <lb n="40105"/>
            dared not question its use, he above all others who had sinned <lb n="40106"/>
            so deeply and so foully against the divine purpose. Meek and <lb n="40107"/>
            abased by this consciousness of the one eternal omnipresent <lb n="40108"/>
            perfect reality his soul took up again her burden of pieties, <lb n="40109"/>
            masses and prayers and sacraments and mortifications, and <lb n="40110"/>
            only then for the first time since he had brooded on the great <lb n="40111"/>
            mystery of love did he feel within him a warm movement like <lb n="40112"/>
            that of some newly born life or virtue of the soul itself. The <lb n="40113"/>
            attitude of rapture in sacred art, the raised and parted hands, <lb n="40114"/>
            the parted lips and eyes as of one about to swoon, became for <lb n="40115"/>
            him an image of the soul in prayer, humiliated and faint before <lb n="40116"/>
            her Creator.<lb n="40117"/> </p>
            <p> But he had been forewarned of the dangers of spiritual exal- <lb n="40118"/>
            tation and did not allow himself to desist from even the least or <lb n="40119"/>
            lowliest devotion,  striving also by constant mortification to <lb n="40120"/>
            undo the sinful past rather than to achieve a saintliness fraught <lb n="40121"/>
            with peril. Each of his senses was brought under a rigorous <lb n="40122"/>
            discipline. In order to mortify the sense of sight he made it his <lb n="40123"/>
            rule to walk in the street with downcast eyes, glancing neither <lb n="40124"/>
            to right nor left and never behind him. His eyes shunned every <lb n="40125"/>
            encounter with the eyes of women. From time to time also he <lb n="40126"/>
            balked them by a sudden effort of the will, as by lifting them <lb n="40127"/>
            suddenly in the middle of an unfinished sentence and closing <lb n="40128"/>
            the book. To mortify his hearing he exerted no control over his <lb n="40129"/>
            voice which was then breaking, neither sang nor whistled and <lb n="40130"/>
            made no attempt to flee from noises which caused him painful <lb n="40131"/>
            nervous irritation such as the sharpening of knives on the <lb n="40132"/>
            knifeboard, the gathering of cinders on the fireshovel and the <lb n="40133"/>
            twigging of the carpet. To mortify his smell was more difficult <lb n="40134"/>
            as he found in himself no instinctive repugnance to bad odours, <lb n="40135"/>
            whether they were the odours of the outdoor world such as <lb n="40136"/>
            those of dung and tar or the odours of his own person among <lb n="40137"/>
            which he had made many curious comparisons and experiments. <lb n="40138"/>
            ments. He found in the end that the only odour against which <lb n="40139"/>
            his sense of smell revolted was a certain stale fishy stink like <lb n="40140"/>
            that of longstanding urine: and whenever it was possible he <lb n="40141"/>
            subjected himself to this unpleasant odour. To mortify the taste <lb n="40142"/>
            he practised strict habits at table, observed to the letter all the <lb n="40143"/>
            fasts of the church and sought by distraction to divert his mind <lb n="40144"/>
            from the savours of different foods. But it was to the mortification <lb n="40145"/>
            cation of touch that he brought the most assiduous ingenuity of <lb n="40146"/>
            inventiveness. He never consciously changed his position in <lb n="40147"/>
            bed, sat in the most uncomfortable positions, suffered patiently <lb n="40148"/>
            every itch and pain, kept away from the fire, remained on his <lb n="40149"/>
            knees all through the mass except at the gospels, left parts of <lb n="40150"/>
            his neck and face undried so that air might sting them and, <lb n="40151"/>
            whenever he was not saying his beads, carried his arms stiffly <lb n="40152"/>
            at his sides like a runner and never in his pockets or clasped <lb n="40153"/>
            behind him.<lb n="40154"/> </p>
            <p> He had no temptations to sin mortally. It surprised him <lb n="40155"/>
            however to find that at the end of his course of intricate piety <lb n="40156"/>
            and selfrestraint he was so easily at the mercy of childish and <lb n="40157"/>
            unworthy imperfections. His prayers and fasts availed him little <lb n="40158"/>
            for the suppression of anger at hearing his mother sneeze or at <lb n="40159"/>
            being disturbed in his devotions. It needed an immense effort of <lb n="40160"/>
            his will to master the impulse which urged him to give outlet to <lb n="40161"/>
            such irritation. Images of the outbursts of trivial anger which <lb n="40162"/>
            he had often noted among his masters, their twitching mouths, <lb n="40163"/>
            closeshut lips and flushed cheeks, recurred to his memory, dis- <lb n="40164"/>
            couraging him, for all his practice of humility, by the comparison. <lb n="40165"/>
            son. To merge his life in the common tide of other lives was <lb n="40166"/>
            harder for him than any fasting or prayer, and it was his <lb n="40167"/>
            constant failure to do this to his own satisfaction which caused <lb n="40168"/>
            in his soul at last a sensation of spiritual dryness together with <lb n="40169"/>
            a growth of doubts and  scruples. His soul traversed a period of <lb n="40170"/>
            desolation in which the sacraments themselves seemed to have <lb n="40171"/>
            turned into dried up sources. His confession became a channel <lb n="40172"/>
            for the escape of scrupulous and unrepented imperfections. His <lb n="40173"/>
            actual reception of the eucharist did not bring him the same <lb n="40174"/>
            dissolving moments of virginal selfsurrender as did those spiritual <lb n="40175"/>
            tual communions made by him sometimes at the close of some <lb n="40176"/>
            visit to the Blessed Sacrament. The book which he used for <lb n="40177"/>
            these visits was an old neglected book written by saint Alphonsus <lb n="40178"/>
            sus Liguori, with fading characters and sere foxpapered leaves. <lb n="40179"/>
            A faded world of fervent love and virginal responses seemed to <lb n="40180"/>
            be evoked for his soul by the reading of its pages in which the <lb n="40181"/>
            imagery of the canticles was interwoven with the communicant's <lb n="40182"/>
            cant's prayers. An inaudible voice seemed to caress the soul, <lb n="40183"/>
            telling her names and glories, bidding her arise as for espousal <lb n="40184"/>
            and come away, bidding her look forth, a spouse, from Amana <lb n="40185"/>
            and from the mountains of the leopards; and the soul seemed to <lb n="40186"/>
            answer with the same inaudible voice, surrendering herself:<lb n="40187"/> </p>
            <p> <seg xml:lang="la">Inter ubera mea commorabitur</seg>.<lb n="40188"/> </p>
            <p> This idea of surrender had a perilous attraction for his mind <lb n="40189"/>
            now that he felt his soul beset once again by the insistent voices <lb n="40190"/>
            of the flesh which began to murmur to him again during his <lb n="40191"/>
            prayers and meditations. It gave him an intense sense of power <lb n="40192"/>
            to know that he  could by a single act of consent, in a moment <lb n="40193"/>
            of thought, undo all that he had done. He seemed to feel a <lb n="40194"/>
            flood slowly advancing towards his naked feet and to be waiting <lb n="40195"/>
            ing for the first faint timid noiseless wavelet to touch his <lb n="40196"/>
            fevered skin. Then, almost at the instant of that touch, almost <lb n="40197"/>
            at the verge of sinful consent, he found himself standing far <lb n="40198"/>
            away from the flood upon a dry shore, saved by a sudden act of <lb n="40199"/>
            the will or a sudden ejaculation: and, seeing the silver line of <lb n="40200"/>
            the flood far away and beginning again its slow advance to- <lb n="40201"/>
            wards his feet, a new thrill of power and satisfaction shook his <lb n="40202"/>
            soul to know that he had not yielded nor undone all.<lb n="40203"/> </p>
            <p> When he had eluded the flood of temptation many times in <lb n="40204"/>
            this way he grew troubled and wondered whether the grace <lb n="40205"/>
            which he had refused to lose was not being filched from him <lb n="40206"/>
            little by little. The clear certitude of his own immunity grew <lb n="40207"/>
            dim and to it succeeded a vague fear that his soul had really <lb n="40208"/>
            fallen unawares. It was with difficulty that he won back his old <lb n="40209"/>
            consciousness of his state of grace by telling himself that he had <lb n="40210"/>
            prayed to God at every temptation and that the grace which he <lb n="40211"/>
            had prayed for must have been given to him inasmuch as God <lb n="40212"/>
            was obliged to give it. The very frequency and violence of <lb n="40213"/>
            temptations showed him at last the truth of what he had heard <lb n="40214"/>
            about the trials of the saints. Frequent and violent temptations <lb n="40215"/>
            were a proof that the citadel of the soul had not fallen and that <lb n="40216"/>
            the devil raged to make it fall.<lb n="40217"/> </p>
            <p> Often when he had confessed his doubts and scruples, some <lb n="40218"/>
            momentary inattention at prayer, a movement of trivial anger <lb n="40219"/>
            in his soul or a subtle wilfulness in speech or act, he was bidden <lb n="40220"/>
            by his confessor to name some sin of his past life before absolution <lb n="40221"/>
            ution was given him. He named it with humility and shame and <lb n="40222"/>
            repented of it once more. It humiliated and shamed him to <lb n="40223"/>
            think that he would never be freed from it wholly, however <lb n="40224"/>
            holily he might live or whatever virtues or perfections he might <lb n="40225"/>
            attain. A restless feeling of guilt would always be present with <lb n="40226"/>
            him: he would confess and repent and be absolved, confess and <lb n="40227"/>
            repent again and be absolved again, fruitlessly. Perhaps that <lb n="40228"/>
            first hasty confession wrung from him by the fear of hell had <lb n="40229"/>
            not been good? Perhaps, concerned only for his imminent <lb n="40230"/>
            doom, he had not had sincere sorrow for his sin? But the surest <lb n="40231"/>
            sign that his confession had been good and that he had had <lb n="40232"/>
            sincere sorrow for his sin was, he knew, the amendment of his <lb n="40233"/>
            life. <lb n="40234"/>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―I have amended  my life, have I not? he asked himself.<lb n="40235"/></said> </p>

            <p> The director stood in the embrasure of the window, his back <lb n="40236"/>
            to the light, leaning an elbow on the brown crossblind and, as <lb n="40237"/>
            he spoke and smiled, slowly dangling and looping the cord of <lb n="40238"/>
            the other blind. Stephen stood before him, following for a mo- <lb n="40239"/>
            ment with his eyes the waning of the long summer daylight <lb n="40240"/>
            above the roofs or the slow deft movements of the priestly <lb n="40241"/>
            fingers. The priest's face was in total shadow but the waning <lb n="40242"/>
            daylight from behind him touched the deeply grooved temples <lb n="40243"/>
            and the curves of the skull. Stephen followed also with his ears <lb n="40244"/>
            the accents and intervals of the priest's voice as he spoke <lb n="40245"/>
            gravely and cordially of indifferent themes, the vacation which <lb n="40246"/>
            had just ended, the colleges of the order abroad, the transference <lb n="40247"/>
            ence of masters. The grave and cordial voice went on easily <lb n="40248"/>
            with its tale, and in the pauses Stephen felt bound to set it on <lb n="40249"/>
            again with respectful questions. He knew that the tale was a <lb n="40250"/>
            prelude and his mind waited for the sequel. Ever since the <lb n="40251"/>
            message of summons had come for him from the director his <lb n="40252"/>
            mind had struggled to find the meaning of the message; and <lb n="40253"/>
            during the long restless time he had sat in the college parlour <lb n="40254"/>
            waiting for the director to come in his eyes had wandered from <lb n="40255"/>
            one sober picture to another around the walls and his mind had <lb n="40256"/>
            wandered from one guess to another until the meaning of the <lb n="40257"/>
            summons had almost become clear. Then, just as he was wishing <lb n="40258"/>
            ing that some unforeseen cause might prevent the director from <lb n="40259"/>
            coming he had heard the handle of the door turning and the <lb n="40260"/>
            swish of a soutane.<lb n="40261"/> </p>
            <p> The director had begun to speak of the dominican and fran- <lb n="40262"/>
            ciscan orders and of the friendship between saint Thomas and <lb n="40263"/>
            saint Bonaventure. The capuchin dress, he thought, was rather <lb n="40264"/>
            too .......<lb n="40265"/> </p>
            <p> Stephen's face gave back the priest's indulgent smile and, not <lb n="40266"/>
            being anxious to give an opinion, he made a slight dubitative <lb n="40267"/>
            movement with his lips. <lb n="40268"/>
            <said who="the director">―I believe, continued the director, that there is some talk now <lb n="40269"/>
            among the capuchins themselves of doing away with it and <lb n="40270"/>
            following the example of the other franciscans.<lb n="40271"/> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―I suppose they would retain it in the cloister, said Stephen.<lb n="40272"/> </said>
            <said who="the director">―O certainly, said the director. For the cloister it is all right <lb n="40273"/>
            but for the street I really think it would be better to do away <lb n="40274"/>
            with it, don't you?<lb n="40275"/> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―It must be troublesome, I imagine.<lb n="40276"/> </said>
            <said who="Priest">―Of course it is, of course. Just imagine when I was in Bel- <lb n="40277"/>
            gium I used to see them out cycling in all kinds of weather with <lb n="40278"/>
            this thing up about their knees! It was really ridiculous. <seg xml:lang="fr">Les <lb n="40279"/>
            jupes</seg>, they call them in Belgium.<lb n="40280"/></said> </p>
            <p> The vowel was so modified as to be indistinct. <lb n="40281"/>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―What do they call them?<lb n="40282"/> </said>
            <said who="Priest">―<seg xml:lang="fr">Les jupes.</seg><lb n="40283"/> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">O.<lb n="40284"/></said> </p>
            <p> Stephen smiled again in answer to the smile which he could <lb n="40285"/>
            not see on the priest's shadowed face, its image or spectre only <lb n="40286"/>
            passing rapidly across his mind as the low discreet accent fell <lb n="40287"/>
            upon his ear. He gazed calmly before him at the waning sky, <lb n="40288"/>
            glad of the cool of the evening and the faint yellow glow <lb n="40289"/>
            which hid the tiny flame kindling upon his cheek.<lb n="40290"/> </p>
            <p> The names of articles of dress worn by women or of certain <lb n="40291"/>
            soft and delicate stuffs used in their making brought always to <lb n="40292"/>
            his mind a delicate and sinful perfume. As a boy he had imagined <lb n="40293"/>
            ined the reins by which horses are driven as slender silken <lb n="40294"/>
            bands and it shocked him to feel at <place><location><geo>53.293003 -6.168866</geo></location><placeName>Stradbrook</placeName></place> the greasy <lb n="40295"/>
            leather of harness. It had shocked him too when he had felt for <lb n="40296"/>
            the first time beneath his tremulous fingers the brittle texture of <lb n="40297"/>
            a woman's stocking for, retaining nothing of all he read save <lb n="40298"/>
            that which seemed to him an echo or a prophecy of his own <lb n="40299"/>
            state, it was only amid softworded phrases or within rosesoft <lb n="40300"/>
            stuffs that he dared to conceive of the soul or body of a woman <lb n="40301"/>
            moving with tender life.<lb n="40302"/> </p>
            <p> But the phrase on the priest's lips was disingenuous for he <lb n="40303"/>
            knew that a priest should not speak lightly on that theme. The <lb n="40304"/>
            phrase had been spoken lightly with design and he felt that his <lb n="40305"/>
            face was being searched by the eyes in the shadow. Whatever <lb n="40306"/>
            he had heard or read of the craft of jesuits he had put aside <lb n="40307"/>
            frankly as not borne out by his own experience. His masters, <lb n="40308"/>
            even when they had not attracted him, had seemed to him <lb n="40309"/>
            always intelligent and serious priests, athletic and highspirited <lb n="40310"/>
            prefects. He thought of them as men who washed their bodies <lb n="40311"/>
            briskly with cold water and wore clean cold linen. During all <lb n="40312"/>
            the years he had lived among them in <place><location><geo>53.310601 -6.695541</geo></location><placeName>Clongowes</placeName></place> <lb n="40313"/>
            and in <place><location><geo>52.207800 -8.211070</geo></location><placeName>Bel-
            vedere</placeName></place> he had received only two pandies and, though these had <lb n="40314"/>
            been dealt him in the wrong, he knew that he had often escaped <lb n="40315"/>
            punishment. During all those years he had never heard from <lb n="40316"/>
            any of his masters a flippant word: it was they who had taught <lb n="40317"/>
            him christian doctrine and urged him to live a good life and, <lb n="40318"/>
            when he had fallen into grievous sin, it was they who had led <lb n="40319"/>
            him back to grace. Their presence had made him diffident of <lb n="40320"/>
            himself when he was a muff in Clongowes and it had made him <lb n="40321"/>
            diffident of himself also while he had held his equivocal <lb n="40322"/>
            position in Belvedere. A constant sense of this had remained <lb n="40323"/>
            with him up to the last year of his school life. He had never <lb n="40324"/>
            once disobeyed or allowed turbulent companions to seduce him <lb n="40325"/>
            from his habit of quiet obedience: and, even when he doubted <lb n="40326"/>
            some statement of a master, he had never presumed to doubt <lb n="40327"/>
            openly. Lately some of their judgments had sounded a little <lb n="40328"/>
            childish in his ears and had made him feel a regret and pity as <lb n="40329"/>
            though he were slowly passing out of an accustomed world and <lb n="40330"/>
            were hearing its language for the last time. One day when some <lb n="40331"/>
            boys had gathered round a priest under the shed near the <lb n="40332"/>
            chapel he had heard the priest say:<lb n="40333"/> </p>
            <p> ―I believe that Lord Macaulay was a man who probably never <lb n="40334"/>
            committed a mortal sin in his life, that is to say, a deliberate <lb n="40335"/>
            mortal sin.<lb n="40336"/> </p>
            <p> Some of the boys had then asked the priest if Victor Hugo <lb n="40337"/>
            were not the greatest French writer. The priest had answered <lb n="40338"/>
            that Victor Hugo had never written half so well when he had <lb n="40339"/>
            turned against the church as he had written when he was a <lb n="40340"/>
            catholic. <lb n="40341"/>
            <said who="Priest">―But there are many eminent French critics, said the priest, <lb n="40342"/>
            who consider that even Victor Hugo, great as he certainly was, <lb n="40343"/>
            had not so pure a French style as Louis Veuillot.<lb n="40344"/></said> </p>
            <p> The tiny flame which the priest's allusion had kindled upon <lb n="40345"/>
            Stephen's cheek had sunk down again and his eyes were still <lb n="40346"/>
            fixed calmly on the colorless sky. But an unresting doubt flew <lb n="40347"/>
            hither and thither before his mind. Masked memories passed <lb n="40348"/>
            quickly before him: he recognised scenes and persons yet he <lb n="40349"/>
            was conscious that he had failed to perceive some vital circumstance <lb n="40350"/>
            stance in them. He saw himself walking about the grounds <lb n="40351"/>
            watching the sports in <place><location><geo>53.348746 -6.275034</geo></location><placeName>Clongowes</placeName></place> and eating slim jim out of his <lb n="40352"/>
            cricketcap. Some jesuits were walking round the cycletrack in <lb n="40353"/>
            the company of ladies. The echoes of certain expressions used <lb n="40354"/>
            in <place><location><geo>53.348746 -6.275034</geo></location><placeName>Clongowes</placeName></place> sounded in remote caves of his mind.<lb n="40355"/> </p>
            <p> His ears were listening to these distant echoes amid the si- <lb n="40356"/>
            lence of the parlour when he became aware that the priest was <lb n="40357"/>
            addressing him in a different voice.<lb n="40358"/> </p>
            <p> ―I sent for you today, Stephen, because I wished to speak to <lb n="40359"/>
            you on a very important subject.<lb n="40360"/> </p>
            <p> ―Yes, sir.<lb n="40361"/> </p>
            <p> ―Have you ever felt that you had a vocation?<lb n="40362"/> </p>
            <p> Stephen parted his lips to answer yes and then withheld the <lb n="40363"/>
            word suddenly. The priest waited for the answer and added:<lb n="40364"/> </p>
            <p> ―I mean have you ever felt within yourself, in your soul, a <lb n="40365"/>
            desire to join the order. Think.<lb n="40366"/> </p>
            <p> ―I have sometimes thought of it, said Stephen.<lb n="40367"/> </p>
            <p> The priest let the blindcord fall to one side and, uniting his <lb n="40368"/>
            hands, leaned his chin gravely upon them, communing with <lb n="40369"/>
            himself. <lb n="40370"/>
            <said who="Priest">―In a college like this, he said at length, there is one boy or <lb n="40371"/>
            perhaps two or three boys whom God calls to the religious life. <lb n="40372"/>
            Such a boy is marked off from his companions by his piety, by <lb n="40373"/>
            the good example he shows to others. He is looked up to by <lb n="40374"/>
            them; he is chosen perhaps as prefect by his fellow sodalists. <lb n="40375"/>
            And you, Stephen, have been such a boy in this college, prefect <lb n="40376"/>
            of Our Blessed Lady's sodality. Perhaps you are the boy in this <lb n="40377"/>
            college whom God designs to call to Himself.<lb n="40378"/></said> </p>
            <p> A strong note of pride reinforcing the gravity of the priest's <lb n="40379"/>
            voice made Stephen's heart quicken in response.<lb n="40380"/> </p>
            <p> ―To receive that call, Stephen, said the priest, is the greatest <lb n="40381"/>
            honour that the Almighty God can bestow upon a man. No <lb n="40382"/>
            king or emperor on this earth has the power of the priest <lb n="40383"/>
            of God. No angel or archangel in heaven, no saint, not even <lb n="40384"/>
            the Blessed Virgin herself has the power of a priest of God: the <lb n="40385"/>
            power of the keys, the power to bind and to loose from sin, the <lb n="40386"/>
            power of exorcism, the power to cast out from the creatures of <lb n="40387"/>
            God the evil spirits that have power over them, the power, the <lb n="40388"/>
            authority, to make the great God of Heaven come down upon <lb n="40389"/>
            the altar and take the form of bread and wine. What an awful <lb n="40390"/>
            power, Stephen!<lb n="40391"/> </p>
            <p> A flame began to flutter again on Stephen's cheek as he <lb n="40392"/>
            heard in this proud address an echo of his own proud musings. <lb n="40393"/>
            How often had he seen himself as a priest wielding calmly and <lb n="40394"/>
            humbly the awful power of which angels and saints stood in <lb n="40395"/>
            reverence! His soul had loved to muse in secret on this desire. <lb n="40396"/>
            He had seen himself, a young and silentmannered priest, en- <lb n="40397"/>
            tering a confessional swiftly, ascending the altarsteps, in- <lb n="40398"/>
            censing, genuflecting, accomplishing the vague acts of the <lb n="40399"/>
            priesthood which pleased him by reason of their semblance of <lb n="40400"/>
            reality and of their distance from it. In that dim life which he <lb n="40401"/>
            had lived through in his musings he had assumed the voices and <lb n="40402"/>
            gestures which he had noted with various priests. He had bent <lb n="40403"/>
            his knee sideways like such a one, he had shaken the thurible <lb n="40404"/>
            only slightly like such a one, his chasuble had swung open like <lb n="40405"/>
            that of such another as he had turned to the altar again after <lb n="40406"/>
            having blessed the people. And above all it had pleased him to <lb n="40407"/>
            fill the second place in those dim scenes of his imagining. He <lb n="40408"/>
            shrank from the dignity of celebrant because it displeased him <lb n="40409"/>
            to imagine that all the vague pomp should end in his own <lb n="40410"/>
            person or that the ritual should assign to him so clear and final <lb n="40411"/>
            an office. He longed for the minor sacred offices, to be vested <lb n="40412"/>
            with the tunicle of subdeacon at high mass, to stand aloof from <lb n="40413"/>
            the altar, forgotten by the people, his shoulders covered with a <lb n="40414"/>
            humeral veil, holding the paten within its folds, or, when the <lb n="40415"/>
            sacrifice had  been accomplished, to stand as deacon in a dal- <lb n="40416"/>
            matic of cloth of gold on the step below the celebrant, his <lb n="40417"/>
            hands joined and his face towards the people, and sing the <lb n="40418"/>
            chant <seg xml:lang="la">Ite, missa est</seg>. If ever he had seen himself celebrant it was <lb n="40419"/>
            as in the pictures of the mass in his child's massbook, in a <lb n="40420"/>
            church without worshippers, save for the angel of the sacrifice, <lb n="40421"/>
            at a bare altar and served by an acolyte scarcely more boyish <lb n="40422"/>
            than himself. In vague sacrificial or sacramental acts alone his <lb n="40423"/>
            will seemed drawn to go forth to encounter reality: and it was <lb n="40424"/>
            partly the absence of an appointed rite which had always con- <lb n="40425"/>
            strained him to inaction whether he had allowed silence to <lb n="40426"/>
            cover his anger or pride or had suffered only an embrace he <lb n="40427"/>
            longed to give.<lb n="40428"/> </p>
            <p> He listened in reverent silence now to the priest's appeal and <lb n="40429"/>
            through the words he heard even more distinctly a voice bid- <lb n="40430"/>
            ding him approach, offering him secret knowledge and secret <lb n="40431"/>
            power. He would know then what was the sin  of Simon Magus <lb n="40432"/>
            and what the sin against the Holy Ghost for which there was <lb n="40433"/>
            no forgiveness. He would know obscure things, hidden from <lb n="40434"/>
            others, from those who  were conceived and born children of <lb n="40435"/>
            wrath. He would know the sins, the sinful longings and sinful <lb n="40436"/>
            thoughts and sinful acts, of others, hearing them murmured <lb n="40437"/>
            into his ears in the confessional under the shame of a darkened <lb n="40438"/>
            chapel by the lips of women and of girls: but rendered immune <lb n="40439"/>
            mysteriously at his ordination by the imposition of hands his <lb n="40440"/>
            soul would pass again uncontaminated to the white peace of <lb n="40441"/>
            the altar. No touch of sin would linger upon the hands with <lb n="40442"/>
            which he would elevate and break the host; no touch of sin <lb n="40443"/>
            would linger on his lips in prayer to make him eat and drink <lb n="40444"/>
            damnation to himself, not discerning the body of the Lord. He <lb n="40445"/>
            would hold his secret knowledge and secret power, being as <lb n="40446"/>
            sinless as the innocent: and he would be a priest for ever <lb n="40447"/>
            according to the order of Melchisedec.<lb n="40448"/> </p>
            <p> ―I will offer up my mass tomorrow morning, said the director, <lb n="40449"/>
            tor, that Almighty God may reveal to you His holy will. And <lb n="40450"/>
            let you, Stephen, make a novena to your holy patron saint, the first <lb n="40451"/>
            martyr, who is very powerful with God, that God may en- <lb n="40452"/>
            lighten your mind. But you must be quite sure, Stephen, that <lb n="40453"/>
            you have a vocation because it would be terrible if you found <lb n="40454"/>
            afterwards that you had none. Once a priest always a priest, <lb n="40455"/>
            remember. Your catechism tells you that the sacrament of Holy <lb n="40456"/>
            Orders is one of those which can be received only once because <lb n="40457"/>
            it imprints on the soul an indelible spiritual mark which can <lb n="40458"/>
            never be effaced. It is before you must weigh well, not after. It <lb n="40459"/>
            is a solemn question, Stephen, because on it may depend the <lb n="40460"/>
            salvation of your eternal soul. But we will pray to God to- <lb n="40461"/>
            gether.<lb n="40462"/> </p>
            <p> He held open the heavy hall door and gave his hand as if <lb n="40463"/>
            already to a companion in the spiritual life. Stephen passed out <lb n="40464"/>
            on to  the wide platform above the steps and was conscious of <lb n="40465"/>
            the caress of mild evening air. Towards <place><location><geo>53.354445 -6.263812</geo></location><placeName>Findlater's church</placeName></place> a <lb n="40466"/>
            quartet of young men were striding along with linked arms, <lb n="40467"/>
            swaying their heads and stepping to the agile melody of their <lb n="40468"/>
            leader's concertina. The music passed in an instant, as the first <lb n="40469"/>
            bars of sudden music always did, over the fantastic fabrics of <lb n="40470"/>
            his mind, dissolving them painlessly and noiselessly as a sudden <lb n="40471"/>
            wave dissolves the sandbuilt turrets of children. Smiling at the <lb n="40472"/>
            trivial air he raised his eyes to the priest's face and, seeing in it <lb n="40473"/>
            a mirthless reflection of the sunken day, detached his hand <lb n="40474"/>
            slowly which had acquiesced  faintly in that companionship.<lb n="40475"/> </p>
            <p> As he descended the steps the impression which effaced his <lb n="40476"/>
            troubled selfcommunion was that of a mirthless mask reflecting <lb n="40477"/>
            a sunken day from the threshold of the college. The shadow, <lb n="40478"/>
            then, of the life of the college passed gravely over his consciousness. <lb n="40479"/>
            ness. It was a grave and ordered and passionless life that <lb n="40480"/>
            awaited him, a life without material cares. He wondered how <lb n="40481"/>
            he would pass the first night in the novitiate and with what <lb n="40482"/>
            dismay he would wake the first morning in the dormitory. The <lb n="40483"/>
            troubling odour of the long corridors of <place><location><geo>53.348746 -6.275034</geo></location><placeName>Clongowes</placeName></place> came back <lb n="40484"/>
            to him and he heard the discreet murmur of the burning <lb n="40485"/>
            gasflames. At once from every part of his being unrest began to <lb n="40486"/>
            irradiate. A feverish quickening of his pulses followed and a din <lb n="40487"/>
            of meaningless words drove his reasoned thoughts hither and <lb n="40488"/>
            thither confusedly. His lungs dilated and sank as if he were <lb n="40489"/>
            inhaling a warm moist unsustaining air and he smelt again the <lb n="40490"/>
            warm moist air which hung in the bath in <place><location><geo>53.348746 -6.275034</geo></location><placeName>Clongowes</placeName></place> above the <lb n="40491"/>
            sluggish turfcoloured water.<lb n="40492"/> </p>
            <p> Some instinct, waking at these memories, stronger than edu- <lb n="40493"/>
            cation or piety, quickened within him at every near approach <lb n="40494"/>
            to that life, an instinct subtle and hostile, and armed him <lb n="40495"/>
            against acquiescence. The chill and order of the life repelled <lb n="40496"/>
            him. He saw himself rising in the cold of the morning and filing <lb n="40497"/>
            down with the others to early mass and trying vainly to <lb n="40498"/>
            struggle with his prayers against the fainting sickness of his <lb n="40499"/>
            stomach. He saw himself sitting at dinner with the community <lb n="40500"/>
            of a college. What, then, had become of that deeprooted shyness of <lb n="40501"/>
            his which had made him loth to eat or drink under a strange <lb n="40502"/>
            roof? What had come of the pride of his spirit which had <lb n="40503"/>
            always made him conceive himself as a being apart in every <lb n="40504"/>
            order?<lb n="40505"/> </p>
            <p> The Reverend Stephen Dedalus, S.J.<lb n="40506"/> </p>
            <p> His name in that new life leaped into characters before his <lb n="40507"/>
            eyes and to it there followed a mental sensation of an unde- <lb n="40508"/>
            fined face or colour of a face. The colour faded and became <lb n="40509"/>
            strong like a changing glow of pallid brick red. Was it the raw <lb n="40510"/>
            reddish glow he had so often seen on wintry mornings on the <lb n="40511"/>
            shaven gills of the priests? The face was eyeless and sourfavoured <lb n="40512"/>
            voured and devout, shot with pink tinges of suffocated anger. <lb n="40513"/>
            Was it not a mental spectre of the face of one of the jesuits <lb n="40514"/>
            whom some of the boys called Lantern Jaws and others Foxy <lb n="40515"/>
            Campbell?<lb n="40516"/> </p>
            <p> He was passing at that moment before the <place><location><geo>53.358000 -6.259655</geo></location><placeName>jesuit house in <lb n="40517"/>
            Gardiner Street</placeName></place>, and wondered vaguely which window would <lb n="40518"/>
            be his if he ever joined the order. Then he wondered at the <lb n="40519"/>
            vagueness of his wonder, at the remoteness of his soul <lb n="40520"/>
            from what he had hitherto imagined her sanctuary, at the frail <lb n="40521"/>
            hold which so many years of order and obedience had of him <lb n="40522"/>
            when once a definite and irrevocable act of his threatened to <lb n="40523"/>
            end for ever, in time and in eternity, his freedom. The voice of <lb n="40524"/>
            the director urging upon him the proud claims of the church <lb n="40525"/>
            and the mystery and power of the priestly office repeated itself <lb n="40526"/>
            idly in his memory. His soul was not there to hear and greet it <lb n="40527"/>
            and he knew now that the exhortation he had listened to had <lb n="40528"/>
            already fallen into an idle formal tale. He would never swing <lb n="40529"/>
            the thurible  before the tabernacle as priest. His destiny was to <lb n="40530"/>
            be elusive of social or religious orders. The wisdom of the <lb n="40531"/>
            priest's appeal did not touch him to the quick. He was destined <lb n="40532"/>
            to learn his own wisdom apart from others or to learn the <lb n="40533"/>
            wisdom of others himself wandering among the snares of the <lb n="40534"/>
            world.<lb n="40535"/> </p>
            <p> The snares of the world were its ways of sin. He would fall. <lb n="40536"/>
            He had not yet fallen but he would fall silently, in an instant. <lb n="40537"/>
            Not to fall was too hard, too hard: and he felt the silent lapse <lb n="40538"/>
            of his soul, as it would be at some instant to come, falling, <lb n="40539"/>
            falling but not yet fallen, still unfallen but about to fall.<lb n="40540"/> </p>
            <p> He crossed the bridge over the stream of the <place><location><geo> 53.361845 -6.242480</geo></location><placeName>Tolka</placeName></place> and <lb n="40541"/>
            turned his eyes coldly for an instant towards the faded blue <lb n="40542"/>
            shrine of the Blessed Virgin which stood fowlwise on a pole in <lb n="40543"/>
            the middle of a hamshaped encampment of poor cottages. <lb n="40544"/>
            Then, bending to the left, he followed the lane which led up to <lb n="40545"/>
            his house. The faint sour stink of rotted cabbages came to- <lb n="40546"/>
            wards him from the kitchengardens on the rising ground above <lb n="40547"/>
            the river. He smiled to think that it was this disorder, the <lb n="40548"/>
            misrule and confusion of his father's house and the stagnation <lb n="40549"/>
            of vegetable life, which was to win the day in his soul. Then a <lb n="40550"/>
            short laugh broke from his lips as he thought of that solitary <lb n="40551"/>
            farmhand in the kitchengardens behind their house whom they <lb n="40552"/>
            had nicknamed the man with the hat. A second laugh, taking <lb n="40553"/>
            rise from the first after a pause, broke from him involuntarily <lb n="40554"/>
            as he thought of how the man with the hat worked, considering <lb n="40555"/>
            in turn the four points of the sky and then regretfully plunging <lb n="40556"/>
            his spade in the earth.<lb n="40557"/> </p>
            <p> He pushed open the latchless door of the porch and passed <lb n="40558"/>
            through the naked hallway into the kitchen. A group of his <lb n="40559"/>
            brothers and sisters was sitting round the table. Tea was nearly <lb n="40560"/>
            over and only the last of the second watered tea remained in <lb n="40561"/>
            the bottoms of the small glassjars and jampots which did ser- <lb n="40562"/>
            vice for teacups. Discarded crusts and lumps of sugared bread, <lb n="40563"/>
            turned brown by the tea which had been poured over them, lay <lb n="40564"/>
            scattered on the table. Little wells of tea lay here and there on <lb n="40565"/>
            the board and a knife with a broken ivory handle was stuck <lb n="40566"/>
            through the pith of a ravaged turnover.<lb n="40567"/> </p>
            <p> The sad quiet greyblue glow of the dying day came through <lb n="40568"/>
            the window and the open door, covering over and allaying <lb n="40569"/>
            quietly a sudden instinct of remorse in Stephen's heart. All that <lb n="40570"/>
            had been denied them had been freely given to him, the eldest: <lb n="40571"/>
            but the quiet glow of evening showed him in their faces no sign <lb n="40572"/>
            of rancour.<lb n="40573"/> </p>
            <p> He sat near them at the table and asked where his father and <lb n="40574"/>
            mother were. One answered:<lb n="40575"/> </p>
            <p> ―Goneboro toboro lookboro atboro aboro houseboro.<lb n="40576"/> </p>
            <p> Still another removal! A boy named Fallon in Belvedere had <lb n="40577"/>
            often asked him with a silly laugh why they moved so often. A <lb n="40578"/>
            frown of scorn darkened quickly his forehead as he heard again <lb n="40579"/>
            the silly laugh of the questioner.<lb n="40580"/> </p>
            <p> He asked:<lb n="40581"/> </p>
            <p> ―Why are we on the move again, if it's a fair question?<lb n="40582"/> </p>
            <p> The same sister answered:<lb n="40583"/> </p>
            <p> ―Becauseboro theboro landboro lordboro willboro putboro <lb n="40584"/>
            usboro outboro.<lb n="40585"/> </p>
            <p> The voice of his youngest brother from the farther side of <lb n="40586"/>
            the fireplace began to sing the air <emph>Oft in the Stilly Night</emph>. One <lb n="40587"/>
            by one the others took up the air until a full choir of voices was <lb n="40588"/>
            singing. They would sing so for hours, melody after melody, <lb n="40589"/>
            glee after glee, till the last pale light died down on the horizon, <lb n="40590"/>
            till the first dark nightclouds came forth and night fell.<lb n="40591"/> </p>
            <p> He waited for some moments, listening, before he too took <lb n="40592"/>
            up the air with them. He was listening with pain of spirit to the <lb n="40593"/>
            overtone of weariness behind their frail fresh innocent voices. <lb n="40594"/>
            Even before they set out on life's journey they seemed weary <lb n="40595"/>
            already of the way.<lb n="40596"/> </p>
            <p> He heard the choir of voices in the kitchen echoed and mul- <lb n="40597"/>
            tiplied through an endless reverberation of the choirs of endless <lb n="40598"/>
            generations of children: and heard in all the echoes an echo also <lb n="40599"/>
            of the recurring note of weariness and pain. All seemed weary <lb n="40600"/>
            of life even before entering upon it. And he remembered that <lb n="40601"/>
            Newman had heard this note also in the broken lines of Virgil <lb n="40602"/>
            <emph>giving utterance, like the voice of Nature herself, to that pain <lb n="40603"/>
            and weariness yet hope of better things which has been the <lb n="40604"/>
            experience of her children in every time.</emph><lb n="40605"/> </p>

            Byron's publichouse and then back again to the chapel and <lb n="40609"/>
            then back again to the publichouse he had paced slowly at first, <lb n="40610"/>
            planting his steps scrupulously in the spaces of the patchwork <lb n="40611"/>
            of the footpath, then timing their fall to the fall of verses. A full <lb n="40612"/>
            hour had passed since his father had gone in with Dan Crosby, <lb n="40613"/>
            the tutor, to find out for him something about the <place><location><geo>53.310485 -6.225058</geo></location><placeName>university</placeName></place>. <lb n="40614"/>
            For a full hour he had paced up and down, waiting: but he <lb n="40615"/>
            could wait no longer.<lb n="40616"/> </p>
            <p> He set off abruptly for <place><location><geo>53.359381 -6.179831</geo></location><placeName>the Bull</placeName></place>, walking rapidly lest his <lb n="40617"/>
            father's shrill whistle might call him back; and in a few mo- <lb n="40618"/>
            ments he had rounded the curve at the police barrack and was <lb n="40619"/>
            safe.<lb n="40620"/> </p>
            <p> Yes, his mother was hostile to the idea, as he  had read from <lb n="40621"/>
            her listless silence. Yet her mistrust pricked him more keenly <lb n="40622"/>
            than his father's pride and he thought coldly how he had <lb n="40623"/>
            watched the faith which was fading down in his soul aging and <lb n="40624"/>
            strengthening in her eyes. A dim antagonism gathered force <lb n="40625"/>
            within him and darkened his mind as a cloud against her dis- <lb n="40626"/>
            loyalty: and when it  passed, cloudlike, leaving his mind serene <lb n="40627"/>
            and dutiful towards her again, he was made aware dimly and <lb n="40628"/>
            without regret of a first noiseless sundering of their lives.<lb n="40629"/> </p>
            <p> The university! So he had passed beyond the challenge of the <lb n="40630"/>
            sentries who had stood as guardians of his boyhood and had <lb n="40631"/>
            sought to keep him among them that he might be subject to <lb n="40632"/>
            them and serve their ends. Pride after satisfaction uplifted him <lb n="40633"/>
            like long slow waves. The end he had been born to serve yet <lb n="40634"/>
            did not see had led him to escape by an unseen path: and now it <lb n="40635"/>
            beckoned to him once more and a new adventure was about to <lb n="40636"/>
            be opened to him. It seemed to him that he heard notes of fitful <lb n="40637"/>
            music leaping upwards a tone and downwards a diminished <lb n="40638"/>
            fourth, upwards a tone and downwards a major third, like <lb n="40639"/>
            triplebranching flames leaping fitfully, flame after flame, out of <lb n="40640"/>
            a midnight wood. It was an elfin prelude, endless and formless; <lb n="40641"/>
            and, as it grew wilder and faster, the flames leaping out of <lb n="40642"/>
            time, he seemed to hear from under the boughs and grasses <lb n="40643"/>
            wild creatures racing, their feet pattering like rain upon the <lb n="40644"/>
            leaves. Their feet passed in pattering tumult over his mind, the <lb n="40645"/>
            feet of hares and rabbits, the feet of harts and hinds and ante- <lb n="40646"/>
            lopes, until he heard them no more and remembered only a <lb n="40647"/>
            proud cadence from Newman: <emph>Whose feet are as the feet of <lb n="40648"/>
            harts and underneath the everlasting arms.</emph><lb n="40649"/> </p>
            <p> The pride of that dim image brought back to his mind the <lb n="40650"/>
            dignity of the office he had refused. All through his boyhood he <lb n="40651"/>
            had mused upon that which he had so often thought to be his <lb n="40652"/>
            destiny and when the moment had come for him to obey the <lb n="40653"/>
            call he had turned aside, obeying a wayward instinct. Now <lb n="40654"/>
            time lay between: the oils of ordination would never anoint his <lb n="40655"/>
            body. He had refused. Why?<lb n="40656"/> </p>
            <p> He turned seaward  from the road at <place><location><geo>53.365979 -6.174239</geo></location><placeName>Dollymount</placeName></place> and as he <lb n="40657"/>
            passed on to the thin wooden bridge he felt the planks shaking <lb n="40658"/>
            with the tramp of heavily shod feet. A squad of christian <lb n="40659"/>
            brothers was on its way back from the <place><location><geo>53.369769 -6.147334</geo></location><placeName>Bull</placeName></place> and had begun to <lb n="40660"/>
            pass, two by two, across the bridge. Soon the whole bridge was <lb n="40661"/>
            trembling and resounding. The uncouth faces passed him two <lb n="40662"/>
            by two, stained yellow or red or livid by the sea, and as he <lb n="40663"/>
            strove to look at them with ease and indifference, a faint stain <lb n="40664"/>
            of personal shame and commiseration rose to his own face. <lb n="40665"/>
            Angry with himself he tried to hide his face from their eyes by <lb n="40666"/>
            gazing down sideways into the shallow swirling water under <lb n="40667"/>
            the bridge but he still saw a reflection therein of their topheavy <lb n="40668"/>
            silk hats, and humble tapelike collars and loosely hanging cleri- <lb n="40669"/>
            cal clothes. <lb n="40670"/>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Brother Hickey. <lb n="40671"/>
            Brother Quaid. <lb n="40672"/>
            Brother MacArdle. <lb n="40673"/>
            Brother Keogh.<lb n="40674"/></said> </p>
            <p> Their piety would be like their names, like their faces, like <lb n="40675"/>
            their clothes, and it was idle for him to tell himself that their <lb n="40676"/>
            humble and contrite hearts, it might be, paid a far richer tribute <lb n="40677"/>
            of devotion than his had ever been, a gift tenfold more acceptable <lb n="40678"/>
            able than his elaborate adoration. It was idle for him to move <lb n="40679"/>
            himself to be generous towards them, to tell himself that if he <lb n="40680"/>
            ever came to their gates, stripped of his pride, beaten and in <lb n="40681"/>
            beggar's weeds, that they would be generous towards him, <lb n="40682"/>
            loving him as themselves. Idle and embittering, finally,  to ar- <lb n="40683"/>
            gue, against his own dispassionate certitude, that the com- <lb n="40684"/>
            mandment of love bade us not to love our neighbour  as <lb n="40685"/>
            ourselves with the same amount and intensity of love but to <lb n="40686"/>
            love him as ourselves with the same kind of love.<lb n="40687"/> </p>
            <p> He drew forth a phrase from his treasure and spoke it softly <lb n="40688"/>
            to himself:<lb n="40689"/> </p>
            <p> ―A day of dappled seaborne clouds.<lb n="40690"/> </p>
            <p> The phrase and the day and the scene harmonised in a <lb n="40691"/>
            chord. Words. Was it their colours? He allowed them to glow <lb n="40692"/>
            and fade, hue after hue: sunrise gold, the russet and green of <lb n="40693"/>
            apple orchards, azure of waves, the greyfringed fleece of <lb n="40694"/>
            clouds. No, it was not their colours: it was the poise and <lb n="40695"/>
            balance of the period itself. Did he then love the rhythmic rise <lb n="40696"/>
            and fall of words better than their associations of legend and <lb n="40697"/>
            colour? Or was it that, being as weak of sight as he was shy of <lb n="40698"/>
            mind, he drew less pleasure from the reflection of the glowing <lb n="40699"/>
            sensible world through the prism of a language manycoloured <lb n="40700"/>
            and richly storied than from the contemplation of an inner <lb n="40701"/>
            world of individual emotions mirrored perfectly in a lucid <lb n="40702"/>
            supple periodic prose?<lb n="40703"/> </p>
            <p> He passed from the trembling bridge on to firm land again. <lb n="40704"/>
            At that instant, as it seemed to him, the air was chilled and <lb n="40705"/>
            looking askance towards the water he saw a flying squall dark- <lb n="40706"/>
            ening and crisping suddenly the tide. A faint click at his heart, a <lb n="40707"/>
            faint throb in his throat told him once more of how his flesh <lb n="40708"/>
            dreaded the cold infrahuman odour of the sea: yet he did not <lb n="40709"/>
            strike across the downs on his left but held straight on along <lb n="40710"/>
            the spine of rocks that pointed against the river's mouth.<lb n="40711"/> </p>
            <p> A veiled sunlight lit up faintly the grey sheet of water where <lb n="40712"/>
            the river was embayed. In the distance along the course of the <lb n="40713"/>
            slowflowing Liffey slender masts flecked the sky and, more <lb n="40714"/>
            distant still, the dim fabric of the city lay prone in haze. Like a <lb n="40715"/>
            scene on some vague arras, old as man's weariness, the image <lb n="40716"/>
            of the seventh city of christendom was visible to him across the <lb n="40717"/>
            timeless air, no older nor more weary nor less patient of subjection <lb n="40718"/>
            tion than in the days of the thingmote.<lb n="40719"/> </p>
            <p> Disheartened, he raised his eyes towards the slowdrifting <lb n="40720"/>
            clouds, dappled and seaborne. They were voyaging across the <lb n="40721"/>
            deserts of the sky, a host of nomads on the march, voyaging <lb n="40722"/>
            high over Ireland, westward bound. The Europe they had come <lb n="40723"/>
            from lay out there beyond the <place><location><geo>53.13 -5.32</geo></location><placeName>Irish Sea</placeName></place>, Europe of strange <lb n="40724"/>
            tongues and valleyed and woodbegirt and citadelled and of <lb n="40725"/>
            entrenched and marshalled races. He heard a confused music <lb n="40726"/>
            within him as of memories and names which he was almost <lb n="40727"/>
            conscious of but could not capture even for an instant; then the <lb n="40728"/>
            music seemed to recede, to  recede, to recede: and from each <lb n="40729"/>
            receding trail of nebulous music there fell always one long- <lb n="40730"/>
            drawn calling note, piercing like a star the dusk of silence. <lb n="40731"/>
            Again! Again! Again! Again! A voice from beyond the world <lb n="40732"/>
            was calling. <lb n="40733"/>
            <said who="a voice">―Hello, Stephanos!<lb n="40734"/> </said>
            <said who="a voice">―Here comes The Dedalus!<lb n="40735"/> </said>
            <said who="a voice">―Ao! ... Eh, give it over, Dwyer, I'm telling you or I'll give you <lb n="40736"/>
            a stuff in the kisser for yourself .... Ao!<lb n="40737"/> </said>
            <said who="a voice">―Good man, Towser! Duck him!<lb n="40738"/> </said>
            <said who="a voice">―Come along, Dedalus! Bous Stephanoumenos! Bous Steph- <lb n="40739"/>
            aneforos!<lb n="40740"/> </said>
            <said who="a voice">―Duck him! Guzzle him now, Towser!<lb n="40741"/> </said>
            <said who="a voice">―Help! Help! ... Ao!<lb n="40742"/></said> </p>
            <p> He recognised their speech collectively before he distin- <lb n="40743"/>
            guished their faces. The mere sight of that medley of wet <lb n="40744"/>
            nakedness chilled him to the bone. Their bodies, corpsewhite <lb n="40745"/>
            or suffused with a pallid golden light or rawly tanned by the <lb n="40746"/>
            sun, gleamed with the wet of the sea. Their divingstone, poised <lb n="40747"/>
            on its rude supports and rocking under their plunges, and the <lb n="40748"/>
            roughhewn stones of the sloping breakwater over which they <lb n="40749"/>
            scrambled in their horseplay, gleamed with cold wet lustre. The <lb n="40750"/>
            towels with which they smacked their bodies were heavy with <lb n="40751"/>
            cold seawater: and drenched with cold brine was their matted <lb n="40752"/>
            hair.<lb n="40753"/> </p>
            <p> He stood still in deference to their calls and parried their <lb n="40754"/>
            banter with easy words. How characterless they looked: Shuley <lb n="40755"/>
            without his deep unbuttoned collar, Ennis without his scarlet <lb n="40756"/>
            belt with the snaky clasp, and Connolly  without his <place><location><geo>52.613969 0.886402</geo></location><placeName>Norfolk</placeName></place> <lb n="40757"/>
            coat with the flapless sidepockets!  It was a pain to see them and <lb n="40758"/>
            a swordlike pain to see the signs of adolescence that made <lb n="40759"/>
            repellent their pitiable nakedness. Perhaps they had taken refuge <lb n="40760"/>
            uge in number and noise from the secret dread in their souls. <lb n="40761"/>
            But he, apart from them and in silence, remembered in what <lb n="40762"/>
            dread he stood of the mystery of his own body.<lb n="40763"/> </p>
            <p> ―Stephanos Dedalos! Bous Stephanoumenos! Bous Stephane- <lb n="40764"/>
            foros!<lb n="40765"/> </p>
            <p> Their banter was not new to him and now it <lb n="40766"/>
            flattered his mild proud sovereignty. Now, as never before, his <lb n="40767"/>
            strange name seemed to him a prophecy. So timeless seemed <lb n="40768"/>
            the grey warm air, so fluid and impersonal his own mood, that <lb n="40769"/>
            all ages were as one to him. A moment before the ghost of <lb n="40770"/>
            the ancient kingdom of the Danes had looked forth through the <lb n="40771"/>
            vesture of the hazewrapped city. Now, at the name of the <lb n="40772"/>
            fabulous artificer, he seemed to hear the noise of dim waves <lb n="40773"/>
            and to see a winged form flying above the waves and slowly <lb n="40774"/>
            climbing the air. What did it mean? Was it a quaint device <lb n="40775"/>
            opening a page of some medieval book of prophecies and sym- <lb n="40776"/>
            bols, a hawklike man flying sunward above the sea, a prophecy <lb n="40777"/>
            of the end he had been born to serve and had been following <lb n="40778"/>
            through the mists of childhood and boyhood, a symbol of the <lb n="40779"/>
            artist forging anew in his workshop out of the sluggish matter <lb n="40780"/>
            of the earth a new soaring impalpable imperishable being?<lb n="40781"/> </p>
            <p> His heart trembled;  his breath came faster and a wild spirit <lb n="40782"/>
            passed over his limbs as though he were soaring sunward. His <lb n="40783"/>
            heart trembled in an ecstasy of fear and his soul was in flight. <lb n="40784"/>
            His soul was soaring in an air beyond the world and the body <lb n="40785"/>
            he knew was purified in a breath and delivered of incertitude <lb n="40786"/>
            and made radiant and commingled with the element of the <lb n="40787"/>
            spirit. An ecstasy of flight made radiant his eyes and wild his <lb n="40788"/>
            breath and tremulous and wild and radiant his windswept <lb n="40789"/>
            limbs. <lb n="40790"/>
            <said who="a voice">―One! Two! ... Look out!<lb n="40790"/> </said>
            <said who="a voice">―O, cripes, I'm drownded!<lb n="40792"/> </said>
            <said who="a voice">―One! Two! Three and away!<lb n="40793"/> </said>

            <said who="a voice">―Stephaneforos!<lb n="40796"/></said> </p>
            <p> His throat ached with a desire to cry aloud, the cry of a <lb n="40797"/>
            hawk or eagle on high, to cry piercingly of his deliverance to <lb n="40798"/>
            the winds. This was the call of life to his soul not the dull gross <lb n="40799"/>
            voice of the world of duties and despair, not the inhuman voice <lb n="40800"/>
            that had called him to the pale service of the altar. An instant <lb n="40801"/>
            of wild flight had delivered him and the cry of triumph which <lb n="40802"/>
            his lips withheld cleft his brain. <lb n="40803"/>
            <said who="a voice">―Stephaneforos!<lb n="40804"/></said> </p>
            <p> What were they now but cerements shaken from the body of <lb n="40805"/>
            death death - the fear he had walked in night and day, the incertitude <lb n="40806"/>
            that had ringed him round, the shame that had abased him <lb n="40807"/>
            within and without - cerements, the linens of the grave?<lb n="40808"/> </p>
            <p> His soul had arisen from the grave of boyhood, spurning her <lb n="40809"/>
            graveclothes. Yes! Yes! Yes! He would create proudly out of the <lb n="40810"/>
            freedom and power of his soul, as the great artificer whose <lb n="40811"/>
            name he bore, a living thing, new and soaring and beautiful, <lb n="40812"/>
            impalpable, imperishable.<lb n="40813"/> </p>
            <p> He started up nervously from the stoneblock for he could no <lb n="40814"/>
            longer quench the flame in his blood. He felt his cheeks aflame <lb n="40815"/>
            and his throat throbbing with song. There was a lust of wan- <lb n="40816"/>
            dering in his feet that burned to set out for the ends of the <lb n="40817"/>
            earth. On! On! his heart seemed to cry. Evening would deepen <lb n="40818"/>
            above the sea, night fall upon the plains, dawn glimmer before <lb n="40819"/>
            the wanderer and show him strange fields and hills and faces. <lb n="40820"/>
            Where?<lb n="40821"/> </p>
            <p> He looked northward towards <place><location><geo>53.378569 -6.057013</geo></location><placeName>Howth</placeName></place>. The sea had fallen <lb n="40822"/>
            below the line of seawrack on the shallow side of the breakwater <lb n="40823"/>
            water and already the tide was running out fast along the <lb n="40824"/>
            foreshore. Already one long oval bank of sand lay warm and <lb n="40825"/>
            dry amid the wavelets. Here and there warm isles of sand <lb n="40826"/>
            gleamed above the shallow tide, and about the isles and around <lb n="40827"/>
            the long bank and amid the shallow currents of the beach were <lb n="40828"/>
            lightclad gayclad figures, wading and delving.<lb n="40829"/> </p>
            <p> In a few moments he was barefoot, his stockings folded in <lb n="40830"/>
            his pockets and his canvas shoes dangling by their knotted laces <lb n="40831"/>
            over his shoulders: and, picking a pointed salteaten stick out of <lb n="40832"/>
            the jetsam among the rocks, he clambered down the slope of <lb n="40833"/>
            the breakwater.<lb n="40834"/> </p>
            <p> There was a long rivulet in the <place><location><geo>53.366498 -6.147804</geo></location><placeName>strand</placeName></place>: and, as he waded <lb n="40835"/>
            slowly up its course, he wondered at the endless drift of sea- <lb n="40836"/>
            weed. Emerald and black and russet and olive, it moved <lb n="40837"/>
            beneath the current, swaying and turning. The water of the <lb n="40838"/>
            rivulet was dark with endless drift and mirrored the highdrifting <lb n="40839"/>
            ing clouds. The clouds were drifting above him silently and <lb n="40840"/>
            silently the seatangle was drifting below him; and the grey <lb n="40841"/>
            warm air was still: and a new wild life was singing in his veins.<lb n="40842"/> </p>
            <p> Where was his boyhood now? Where was the soul that had <lb n="40843"/>
            hung back from her destiny, to brood alone upon the shame of <lb n="40844"/>
            her wounds and in her house of squalor and subterfuge to <lb n="40845"/>
            queen it in faded cerements and in wreaths that withered at the <lb n="40846"/>
            touch? Or where was he?<lb n="40847"/> </p>
            <p> He was alone. He was unheeded, happy and near to the wild <lb n="40848"/>
            heart of life. He was alone and young and wilful and wild- <lb n="40849"/>
            hearted, alone amid a waste of wild air and brackish waters <lb n="40850"/>
            and the seaharvest of shells and tangle and veiled grey sunlight <lb n="40851"/>
            and gayclad lightclad figures, of children and girls and voices <lb n="40852"/>
            childish and girlish in the air.<lb n="40853"/> </p>
            <p> A girl stood before him in midstream, alone and still, gazing <lb n="40854"/>
            out to sea. She seemed like one whom magic had changed into <lb n="40855"/>
            the likeness of a strange and beautiful seabird. Her long slender <lb n="40856"/>
            bare legs were delicate as a crane's and pure save where an <lb n="40857"/>
            emerald trail of seaweed had fashioned itself as a sign upon the <lb n="40858"/>
            flesh. Her thighs, fuller and softhued as ivory, were bared al- <lb n="40859"/>
            most to the hips where the white fringes of her drawers were <lb n="40860"/>
            like featherings of soft white down. Her slateblue skirts were <lb n="40861"/>
            kilted boldly about her waist and dovetailed behind her. Her <lb n="40862"/>
            bosom was as  a bird's soft and slight, slight and soft as the <lb n="40863"/>
            breast of some darkplumaged dove. But her long fair hair was <lb n="40864"/>
            girlish; and girlish, and touched with the wonder of mortal <lb n="40865"/>
            beauty, her face.<lb n="40866"/> </p>
            <p> She was alone and still, gazing out to sea; and when she felt <lb n="40867"/>
            his presence and the worship of his eyes her eyes turned to him <lb n="40868"/>
            in quiet sufferance of his gaze, without shame or wantonness. <lb n="40869"/>
            Long, long she suffered his gaze and then quietly withdrew her <lb n="40870"/>
            eyes from his and bent them towards the stream, gently stirring <lb n="40871"/>
            the water with her foot hither and thither. The first faint noise <lb n="40872"/>
            of gently moving water broke the silence, low and faint and <lb n="40873"/>
            whispering, faint as the bells of sleep; hither and thither, hither <lb n="40874"/>
            and thither: and a faint flame trembled on her cheek.<lb n="40875"/> </p>
            <p> ―Heavenly God! cried Stephen's soul, in an outburst of pro- <lb n="40876"/>
            fane joy.<lb n="40877"/> </p>
            <p> He turned away from her suddenly and set off across the <place><location><geo>53.366498 -6.147804</geo></location><placeName> <lb n="40878"/>
            strand</placeName></place>. His cheeks  were aflame; his body was aglow; his limbs <lb n="40879"/>
            were trembling. On and on and on and on he strode, far out <lb n="40880"/>
            over the sands, singing wildly to the sea, crying to greet the <lb n="40881"/>
            advent of the life that had cried to him.<lb n="40882"/> </p>
            <p> Her image had passed into his soul for ever and no word had <lb n="40883"/>
            broken the holy silence of his ecstasy. Her eyes had called him <lb n="40884"/>
            and his soul had leaped at the call. To live, to err, to fall, to <lb n="40885"/>
            triumph, to recreate life out of life! A wild angel had appeared <lb n="40886"/>
            to him, the angel of mortal youth and beauty, an envoy from <lb n="40887"/>
            the fair courts of life, to throw open before him in an instant of <lb n="40888"/>
            ecstasy the gates of all the ways of error and glory. On and on <lb n="40889"/>
            and on and on!<lb n="40890"/> </p>
            <p> He halted suddenly and heard his heart in the silence. How <lb n="40891"/>
            far had he walked? What hour was it?<lb n="40892"/> </p>
            <p> There was no human figure near him nor any sound borne <lb n="40893"/>
            to him over the air. But the tide was near the turn and already <lb n="40894"/>
            the day was on the wane. He turned landward and ran towards <lb n="40895"/>
            the shore and, running up the sloping beach, reckless of the <lb n="40896"/>
            sharp shingle, found a sandy nook amid a ring of tufted sand- <lb n="40897"/>
            knolls and lay down there that the peace and silence of the <lb n="40898"/>
            evening might still the riot of his blood.<lb n="40899"/> </p>
            <p> He  felt above him the vast indifferent dome and the calm <lb n="40900"/>
            processes of the heavenly bodies; and the earth beneath him, <lb n="40901"/>
            the earth that had borne him, had taken him to her breast.<lb n="40902"/> </p>
            <p> He closed his eyes in the languor of sleep. His eyelids <lb n="40903"/>
            trembled as if they felt the vast cyclic movement of the earth <lb n="40904"/>
            and her watchers, trembled as if they felt the strange light of <lb n="40905"/>
            some new world. His soul was swooning into some new world, <lb n="40906"/>
            fantastic, dim, uncertain as under sea, traversed by cloudy <lb n="40907"/>
            shapes and beings. A world, a glimmer, or a flower? Glimmering <lb n="40908"/>
            ing and trembling, trembling and unfolding, a breaking light, <lb n="40909"/>
            an opening flower, it spread in endless succession to itself, <lb n="40910"/>
            breaking in full crimson and unfolding and fading to palest <lb n="40911"/>
            rose, leaf by leaf and wave of light by wave of light, flooding all <lb n="40912"/>
            the heavens with its soft flushes, every flush deeper than other.<lb n="40913"/> </p>
            <p> Evening had fallen when he woke and the sand and arid <lb n="40914"/>
            grasses of his bed glowed no longer. He rose slowly and, re- <lb n="40915"/>
            calling the rapture of his sleep, sighed at its joy.<lb n="40916"/> </p>
            <p> He climbed to the crest of the sandhill and gazed about him. <lb n="40917"/>
            Evening had fallen. A rim of the young moon cleft the pale <lb n="40918"/>
            waste of sky like the rim of a silver hoop embedded in grey <lb n="40919"/>
            sand: and the tide was flowing in fast to the land with a low <lb n="40920"/>
            whisper of her waves, islanding a few last figures in distant <lb n="40921"/>
            pools.<lb n="40922"/> </p>

            <p> He drained his third cup of watery tea to the dregs and set to <lb n="50001"/>
            chewing the crusts of fried bread that were scattered near him, <lb n="50002"/>
            staring into the dark pool of the jar. The yellow dripping had <lb n="50003"/>
            been scooped out like a boghole and the pool under it brought <lb n="50004"/>

            the blue and white dockets, scrawled and sanded and creased <lb n="50008"/>
            and bearing the name of the pledger as <persName>Daly</persName> or <persName>MacEvoy</persName>. <lb n="50009"/>

            <p> Then he put them aside and gazed thoughtfully at the lid of <lb n="50014"/>

            <p> His mother straightened the battered alarmclock that was <lb n="50017"/>
            lying on its side in the middle of the kitchen mantelpiece until <lb n="50018"/>
            its dial showed a quarter to twelve and then laid it once more <lb n="50019"/>

            allowed his mother to scrub his neck and root into the folds of <lb n="50030"/>

            <said who="Mary Dedalus">―Well, it's a poor case, she said, when a university student is <lb n="50032"/>

            <p> The girl came back making signs to him to be quick and go <lb n="50046"/>

            head and hurried on, stumbling through the mouldering offal, <lb n="50061"/>
            his heart already bitten by an ache of loathing and bitterness. <lb n="50062"/>
            His father's whistle, his mother's mutterings, the screech of an <lb n="50063"/>
            unseen maniac were to him now so many voices offending and <lb n="50064"/>
            threatening to humble the pride of his youth. He drove their <lb n="50065"/>
            echoes even out of his heart with an execration: but as he <lb n="50066"/>
            walked down the avenue and felt the grey morning light falling <lb n="50067"/>
            about him through the dripping trees and smelt the strange <lb n="50068"/>
            wild smell of the wet leaves and bark his soul was loosed of her <lb n="50069"/>
            miseries.<lb n="50070"/> </p>
            <p> The rainladen trees of the avenue evoked in him, as always, <lb n="50071"/>
            memories of the girls and women in the plays of <persName>Gerhart <lb n="50072"/>
            Hauptmann</persName>: and the memory of their pale sorrows and the <lb n="50073"/>
            fragrance falling from the wet branches mingled in a mood of <lb n="50074"/>
            quiet joy. His morning walk across <place><location><geo>53.363150 -6.270676</geo></location><placeName>the city</placeName></place> had begun: and he <lb n="50075"/>
            foreknew that as he passed the sloblands of Fairview he would <lb n="50076"/>
            think of the cloistral silverveined prose of Newman, that as he <lb n="50077"/>
            walked along <place><location><geo>53.357548 -6.242725</geo></location><placeName>the North Strand Road</placeName></place>, glancing idly at the win- <lb n="50078"/>
            dows of the provision shops, he would recall the dark humour <lb n="50079"/>
            of <persName>Guido Cavalcanti</persName> and smile, that as he went by <persName>Baird</persName>'s <lb n="50080"/>
            stonecutting works in <place><location><geo>53.350416 -6.251694</geo></location><placeName>Talbot Place</placeName></place> the spirit of <persName>Ibsen</persName> would <lb n="50081"/>
            blow through him like a keen wind, a spirit of wayward boyish <lb n="50082"/>
            beauty, and that passing a grimy marine dealer's shop beyond <lb n="50083"/>
            the <placeName>Liffey</placeName> he would repeat the song by <persName>Ben Jonson</persName> which <lb n="50084"/>
            begins:<lb n="50085"/> </p>
            <lg> <l><emph>I was not wearier where I lay.</emph></l></lg> <lb n="50086"/>
            <p> His mind when wearied of its search for the essence of <lb n="50087"/>
            beauty amid the spectral words of <persName>Aristotle</persName> or <persName>Aquinas</persName> turned <lb n="50088"/>
            often for its pleasure to the dainty songs of the Elizabethans. <lb n="50089"/>
            His mind, in the vesture of a doubting monk, stood often in <lb n="50090"/>
            shadow under the windows of that age, to hear the grave and <lb n="50091"/>
            mocking music of the lutenists or the frank laughter of waist- <lb n="50092"/>
            coateers until a laugh too low, a phrase, tarnished by time, of <lb n="50093"/>
            chambering and false honour stung his monkish pride and <lb n="50094"/>
            drove him on from his lurkingplace.<lb n="50095"/> </p>
            <p> The lore which he was believed to pass his days brooding <lb n="50096"/>
            upon so that it had rapt him from the companionships of youth <lb n="50097"/>
            was only a garner of slender sentences from <persName>Aristotle</persName>'s poetics <lb n="50098"/>
            and psychology and a <seg xml:lang="la">Synopsis Philosophiae Scholasticae ad <lb n="50099"/>
            mentem divi Thomae</seg>. His thinking was a dusk of doubt and <lb n="50100"/>
            selfmistrust lit up at moments by the lightnings of intuition, but <lb n="50101"/>
            lightnings of so clear a splendour that in those moments the <lb n="50102"/>
            world perished about his feet as if it had been fireconsumed: <lb n="50103"/>
            and thereafter his tongue grew heavy and he met the eyes of <lb n="50104"/>
            others with unanswering eyes for he felt that the spirit of <lb n="50105"/>
            beauty had folded him round like a mantle and that in revery at <lb n="50106"/>
            least he had been acquainted with nobility. But when this brief <lb n="50107"/>
            pride of silence upheld him no longer he was glad to find him- <lb n="50108"/>
            self still in the midst of common lives, passing on his way amid <lb n="50109"/>
            the squalor and noise and sloth of the city fearlessly and with a <lb n="50110"/>
            light heart.<lb n="50111"/> </p>
            <p> Near the hoardings on the canal he met the consumptive <lb n="50112"/>
            man with the doll's face and the brimless hat coming towards <lb n="50113"/>
            him down the slope of the bridge with little steps, tightly but- <lb n="50114"/>
            toned into his chocolate overcoat and holding his furled um- <lb n="50115"/>
            brella a span or two from him like a diviningrod. It must be <lb n="50116"/>
            eleven, he thought, and peered into a dairy to see the time. The <lb n="50117"/>
            clock in the dairy told him that it was five minutes to five but, <lb n="50118"/>
            as he turned away, he heard a clock somewhere near him but <lb n="50119"/>
            unseen beating eleven strokes in swift precision. He laughed as <lb n="50120"/>
            he heard it for it made him think of <persName>MacCann</persName> and he saw him <lb n="50121"/>
            a squat figure in a shooting jacket and breeches and with a fair <lb n="50122"/>
            goatee standing in the wind at <place><location><geo>53.351242 -6.260779</geo></location><placeName>Hopkins' corner</placeName></place>, and heard him <lb n="50123"/>
            say: <lb n="50124"/>
            <said who="MacCann">―Dedalus, you're an antisocial being, wrapped up in yourself. <lb n="50125"/>
            I'm not. I'm a democrat: and I'll work and act for social liberty <lb n="50126"/>
            and equality among all classes and sexes in the United States of <lb n="50127"/>
            the <placeName>Europe</placeName> of the future. <lb n="50128"/></said> </p>
            <p> Eleven! Then he was late for that lecture too. What day of <lb n="50129"/>
            the week was it? He stopped at a newsagent's to read the <lb n="50130"/>
            headline of a placard. Thursday.  Ten to eleven; English: eleven <lb n="50131"/>
            to twelve; French: twelve to one; physics. He fancied to himself <lb n="50132"/>
            the English lecture and felt, even at that distance, restless and <lb n="50133"/>
            helpless. He saw the heads of his classmates meekly bent as <lb n="50134"/>
            they wrote in their notebooks the points they were bidden to <lb n="50135"/>
            note, nominal definitions, essential definitions and examples or <lb n="50136"/>
            dates of birth and death, chief works, a favourable and an <lb n="50137"/>
            unfavourable criticism side by side. His own head was unbent <lb n="50138"/>
            for his thoughts wandered abroad and whether he looked <lb n="50139"/>
            around the little class of students or out of the window across <lb n="50140"/>
            the desolate gardens of the green an odour assailed him of <lb n="50141"/>
            cheerless cellardamp and decay. Another head than his, right <lb n="50142"/>
            before him in the first benches, was poised squarely above its <lb n="50143"/>
            bending fellows like the head of a priest appealing without <lb n="50144"/>
            humility to the tabernacle for the humble worshippers about <lb n="50145"/>
            him. Why was it that when he thought of <persName>Cranly</persName> he could <lb n="50146"/>
            never raise before his mind the entire image of his body but <lb n="50147"/>
            only the image of the head and face? Even now against the grey <lb n="50148"/>
            curtain of the morning he saw it before him like the phantom <lb n="50149"/>
            of a dream, the face of a severed head or deathmask, crowned <lb n="50150"/>
            on the brows by its stiff black upright hair as by an iron crown. <lb n="50151"/>
            It was a priestlike face, priestlike in its pallor, in the wide- <lb n="50152"/>
            winged nose, in the shadowings below the eyes and along the <lb n="50153"/>
            jaws, priestlike in the lips that were long and bloodless and <lb n="50154"/>
            faintly smiling: and <persName>Stephen</persName>, remembering swiftly how he had <lb n="50155"/>
            told <persName>Cranly</persName> of all the tumults and unrest and longings in his <lb n="50156"/>
            soul, day after day and night by night only to be answered by <lb n="50157"/>
            his friend's listening silence, would have told himself that it <lb n="50158"/>
            was the face of a guilty priest who heard confessions of those <lb n="50159"/>
            whom he had not power to absolve but that he felt again in <lb n="50160"/>
            memory the gaze of its dark womanish eyes.<lb n="50161"/> </p>
            <p> Through this image he had a glimpse of a strange dark <lb n="50162"/>
            cavern of speculation but at once turned away from it feeling <lb n="50163"/>
            that it was not yet the hour  to enter it. But the nightshade of his <lb n="50164"/>
            friend's listlessness seemed to be diffusing in the air around him <lb n="50165"/>
            a tenuous and deadly exhalation: and he found himself <lb n="50166"/>
            glancing from one casual word to another on his right or left in <lb n="50167"/>
            stolid wonder that they had been so silently emptied of instan- <lb n="50168"/>
            taneous sense until every mean shop legend bound his mind <lb n="50169"/>
            like the words of a spell and his soul shrivelled up sighing with <lb n="50170"/>
            age as he walked on in a lane among heaps of dead language. <lb n="50171"/>
            His own consciousness of language was ebbing from his brain <lb n="50172"/>
            and trickling into the very words themselves which set to band <lb n="50173"/>
            and disband themselves in wayward rhythms:<lb n="50174"/> </p>
            <lg>
              <l>The ivy whines upon the wall</l> <lb n="50175"/>
              <l>And whines and twines upon the wall</l> <lb n="50176"/>
              <l>The ivy whines upon the wall</l> <lb n="50177"/>
              <l>The yellow ivy on the wall</l> <lb n="50178"/>
              <l>Ivy, ivy up the wall.</l> <lb n="50179"/>
            </lg>
            <p> Did any one ever hear such drivel? Lord Almighty! Who ever <lb n="50180"/>
            heard of ivy whining on a wall? Yellow ivy: that was all right. <lb n="50181"/>
            Yellow ivory also. And what about ivory ivy?<lb n="50182"/> </p>
            <p> The word now shone in his brain, clearer and brighter than <lb n="50183"/>
            any ivory sawn from the mottled tusks of elephants. <emph>Ivory, <lb n="50184"/>

            shrewd northern face of the rector who had taught him to <lb n="50187"/>
            construe the Metamorphoses of <persName>Ovid</persName> in a courtly English, <lb n="50188"/>
            made whimsical by the mention of porkers and potsherds and <lb n="50189"/>
            chines of bacon. He had learnt what little he knew of the laws <lb n="50190"/>
            of Latin verse from a ragged book written by a Portuguese <lb n="50191"/>
            priest:<lb n="50192"/> </p>
            <p><lg><l><seg xml:lang="la">Contrahit orator, variant in carmine vates.</seg></l></lg><lb n="50193"/> </p>
            <p> The crises and victories and secessions in Roman history <lb n="50194"/>
            were handed on to him in the trite words <seg xml:lang="la">in tanto discrimine</seg> <lb n="50195"/>
            and he had tried to peer into the social life of the city of cities <lb n="50196"/>
            through the words <seg xml:lang="la">implere ollam denariorum</seg> which the rector <lb n="50197"/>
            had rendered sonorously as the filling of a pot with denaries. <lb n="50198"/>
            The pages of his timeworn <persName>Horace</persName> never felt cold to the touch <lb n="50199"/>
            even when his own fingers were cold:  they were human pages: <lb n="50200"/>
            and fifty years before they had been turned by the human <lb n="50201"/>
            fingers of <persName>John Duncan Inverarity</persName> and by his brother <persName>William <lb n="50202"/>
            Malcolm Inverarity</persName>. Yes, those were noble names on the dusky <lb n="50203"/>
            flyleaf and, even for so poor a Latinist as he, the dusky verses <lb n="50204"/>
            were as fragrant as though they had lain all those years in <lb n="50205"/>
            myrtle and lavender and vervain: but yet it wounded him to <lb n="50206"/>
            think that he would never be but a shy guest at the feast of the <lb n="50207"/>
            world's culture and that the monkish learning, in terms of <lb n="50208"/>
            which he was striving to forge out an esthetic philosophy, was <lb n="50209"/>
            held no higher by the age he lived in than the subtle and <lb n="50210"/>
            curious jargons of heraldry and falconry.<lb n="50211"/> </p>
            <p> The grey block <place><location><geo>53.345478 -6.257690</geo></location><placeName>of Trinity</placeName></place> on his left, set heavily in the city's <lb n="50212"/>
            ignorance like a great dull stone set in a cumbrous ring, pulled <lb n="50213"/>
            his mind downward: and while he was striving this way and <lb n="50214"/>
            that to free his feet from the fetters of the reformed conscience <lb n="50215"/>
            he came upon the droll statue of the national poet of <placeName>Ireland</placeName>.<lb n="50216"/> </p>
            <p> He looked at it without anger: for, though sloth of the body <lb n="50217"/>
            and of  the soul crept over it like unseen vermin, over the <lb n="50218"/>
            shuffling feet and up the folds of the cloak and around the <lb n="50219"/>
            servile head, it seemed humbly conscious of its indignity. It <lb n="50220"/>
            was a <persName>Firbolg</persName> in the borrowed cloak of a Milesian; and he <lb n="50221"/>
            thought of his friend <persName>Davin</persName>, the peasant student. It was a <lb n="50222"/>
            jesting name between them but the young peasant bore with it <lb n="50223"/>
            lightly, saying: <lb n="50224"/>
            <said who="Davin">―Go on, Stevie. I have a hard head, you tell me. Call me what <lb n="50225"/>
            you will. <lb n="50226"/></said> </p>
            <p> The homely version of his christian name on the lips of his <lb n="50227"/>
            friend had touched Stephen pleasantly when first heard for he <lb n="50228"/>
            was as formal in speech with others as they were with him. <lb n="50229"/>
            Often, as he sat in <persName>Davin</persName>'s rooms in <place><location><geo>53.334106 -6.266592</geo></location><placeName>Grantham Street</placeName></place>, wonder- <lb n="50230"/>
            ing at his friend's wellmade boots that flanked the wall pair by <lb n="50231"/>
            pair and repeating for his friend's simple ear the verses and <lb n="50232"/>
            cadences of others which were the veils of his own longing and <lb n="50233"/>
            dejection, the rude <persName>Firbolg</persName> mind of his listener had drawn his <lb n="50234"/>
            mind towards it and flung it back again, drawing it by a quiet <lb n="50235"/>
            inbred courtesy of attention or by a quaint turn of old English <lb n="50236"/>
            speech or by the force of its delight in rude bodily skill - (for <lb n="50237"/>
            Davin had sat at the feet of <persName>Michael Cusack</persName>, the Gael), <lb n="50238"/>
            repelling swiftly and suddenly by a grossness of intelligence or <lb n="50239"/>
            by a bluntness of feeling or by a dull stare of terror in the eyes <lb n="50240"/>
            the terror of soul of a starving Irish village in which the curfew <lb n="50241"/>
            was still a nightly fear.<lb n="50242"/> </p>
            <p> Side by side with his memory of the deeds of prowess of his <lb n="50243"/>
            uncle <persName>Mat Davin</persName>, the athlete, the young peasant worshipped <lb n="50244"/>
            the sorrowful legend of <placeName>Ireland</placeName>. The gossip of his fellowstu- <lb n="50245"/>
            dents which strove to render the flat life of the college signifi- <lb n="50246"/>
            cant at any cost loved to think of him as a young fenian. His <lb n="50247"/>
            nurse had taught him Irish and shaped the rude imagination by <lb n="50248"/>
            the broken lights of Irish myth. He stood towards this myth <lb n="50249"/>
            upon which no individual mind had ever drawn out a line of <lb n="50250"/>
            beauty and to its unwieldy  tales that divided against themselves <lb n="50251"/>
            as they moved down the cycles in the same attitude as towards <lb n="50252"/>
            the Roman catholic religion, the attitude of a dullwitted loyal <lb n="50253"/>
            serf. Whatsoever of thought or of feeling came to him from <lb n="50254"/>
            England or by way of English culture his mind stood armed <lb n="50255"/>
            against in obedience to a password: and of the world that lay <lb n="50256"/>
            beyond England he knew only the foreign legion of <place><location><geo>46.227638 2.213749</geo></location><placeName>France</placeName></place> in <lb n="50257"/>
            which he spoke of serving.<lb n="50258"/> </p>

            mour <persName>Stephen</persName> had often called him one of the tame geese: and <lb n="50260"/>
            there was even a point of irritation in the name pointed against <lb n="50261"/>
            that very reluctance of speech and deed in his friend which <lb n="50262"/>
            seemed so often to stand between <persName>Stephen</persName>'s mind, eager of <lb n="50263"/>
            speculation, and the hidden ways of Irish life.<lb n="50264"/> </p>
            <p> One night the young peasant, his spirit stung by the violent <lb n="50265"/>
            or luxurious language in which <persName>Stephen</persName> escaped from the cold <lb n="50266"/>
            silence of intellectual revolt, had called up before <persName>Stephen</persName>'s <lb n="50267"/>
            mind a strange vision. The two were walking slowly towards <lb n="50268"/>
            Davin's rooms through the dark narrow streets of the poorer <lb n="50269"/>
            jews. <lb n="50270"/>
            <said who="Davin">―A thing happened to myself, <persName>Stevie</persName>, last autumn coming on <lb n="50271"/>
            winter and I never told it to a living soul and you are the first <lb n="50272"/>
            person now I ever told it to. I disremember if it was October or <lb n="50273"/>
            November. It was October because it was before  I came up <lb n="50274"/>
            here to join the matriculation class. <lb n="50275"/></said> </p>
            <p> <persName>Stephen</persName> had turned his smiling eyes towards his friend's <lb n="50276"/>
            face, flattered by his confidence and won over to sympathy by <lb n="50277"/>
            the speaker's simple accent. <lb n="50278"/>
            <said who="Davin">―I was away all that day from my own place, over in <place><location><geo>52.232134 -8.670125</geo></location><placeName>Butte- <lb n="50279"/>
            vant</placeName></place> (I don't know if you know where that is) at a hurling <lb n="50280"/>
            match between the Croke's Own Boys and the Fearless Thurles <lb n="50281"/>
            and by God, <persName>Stevie</persName>, that was the hard fight. My first cousin <lb n="50282"/>
            Fonsy Davin was stripped to his buff that day minding cool for <lb n="50283"/>
            the Limericks but he was up with the forwards half the time <lb n="50284"/>
            and shouting like mad. I never will forget that day. One of the <lb n="50285"/>
            Crokes made a woful wipe at him one time with his camaun <lb n="50286"/>
            and I declare to God he was within an aim's ace of getting it at <lb n="50287"/>
            the side of the temple. O, honest to God, if the crook of it <lb n="50288"/>
            caught him that time he was done for. <lb n="50289"/> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―I am glad he escaped, Stephen had said with a laugh, but <lb n="50290"/>
            surely that's not the strange thing  that happened you? <lb n="50291"/> </said>
            <said who="Davin">―Well, I suppose that doesn't interest you but leastways there <lb n="50292"/>
            was such noise after the match that I missed the train home and <lb n="50293"/>
            I couldn't get any kind of a yoke to give me a lift for, as luck <lb n="50294"/>
            would have it, there was a mass meeting that same day over in <lb n="50295"/>
            <placeName>Castletownroche</placeName>and all the cars in the country were there. So <lb n="50296"/>
            there was nothing for it only to stay the night or to foot it out. <lb n="50297"/>
            Well, I started to walk and on I went and it was coming on <lb n="50298"/>
            night when I got into the  <place><location><geo>52.303056 -8.538611</geo></location><placeName>Ballyhoura hills</placeName></place> that's better than ten <lb n="50299"/>
            miles from <place><location><geo>52.399821 -8.575387</geo></location><placeName>Kilmallock</placeName></place> and there's a long lonely road after that. <lb n="50300"/>
            You wouldn't see the sign of a christian house along the road or <lb n="50301"/>
            hear a sound. It was pitch dark almost. Once or twice I stopped <lb n="50302"/>
            by the way under a bush to redden my pipe and only for the <lb n="50303"/>
            dew was thick I'd have stretched out there and slept. At last <lb n="50304"/>
            after a bend of the road I spied a little cottage with a light in <lb n="50305"/>
            the window. I went up and knocked at the door. A voice asked <lb n="50306"/>
            who was there and I answered I was over at the match in <lb n="50307"/>
            <placeName>Buttevant</placeName> and was walking back and that I'd be thankful for a <lb n="50308"/>
            glass of water. After a while a young woman opened the door <lb n="50309"/>
            and brought me out a big mug of milk. She was half undressed <lb n="50310"/>
            as if she was going to bed when I knocked and she had her hair <lb n="50311"/>
            hanging: and I thought by her figure and by something in the <lb n="50312"/>
            look of her eyes that she must be carrying a child. She kept me <lb n="50313"/>
            in talk a long while at the door and I thought it strange because <lb n="50314"/>
            her breast and her shoulders were bare. She asked me was I <lb n="50315"/>
            tired and would I like to stop the night there. She said she was <lb n="50316"/>
            all alone in the house and that her husband had gone that <lb n="50317"/>
            morning to <place><location><geo>53.273188 -6.092767</geo></location><placeName>Queenstown</placeName></place> with his sister to see her off. And all <lb n="50318"/>
            the time she was talking, <persName>Stevie</persName>, she had her eyes fixed on my <lb n="50319"/>
            face and she stood so close to me I could hear her breathing. <lb n="50320"/>
            When I handed her back the mug at last she took my hand to <lb n="50321"/>
            draw me in over the threshold and said: <emph>Come in and stay the <lb n="50322"/>
            night here. You've no call to be frightened. There's no-one in it <lb n="50323"/>
            but ourselves</emph> ........ I didn't go in, <persName>Stevie</persName>.  I thanked her and <lb n="50324"/>
            went on my way again, all in a fever. At the first bend of the <lb n="50325"/>
            road I looked back and she was standing in the door. <lb n="50326"/></said> </p>
            <p> The last words of <persName>Davin</persName>'s story sang in his memory  and the <lb n="50327"/>
            figure of the woman in the story stood forth reflected in other <lb n="50328"/>
            figures of the peasant women whom he had seen standing in <lb n="50329"/>
            the doorways at <place><location><geo>53.293785 -6.687040</geo></location><placeName>Clane</placeName></place> as the college cars drove by, as a type of <lb n="50330"/>
            her race and his own, a batlike soul waking to the conscious- <lb n="50331"/>
            ness of itself in darkness and secrecy and loneliness and, <lb n="50332"/>
            through the eyes and voice and gesture of a woman without <lb n="50333"/>
            guile, calling the stranger to her bed.<lb n="50334"/> </p>
            <p> A hand was laid on his arm and a young voice cried: <lb n="50335"/>
            <said who="???">―Ah, gentleman, your own girl, sir! The first handsel today, <lb n="50336"/>
            gentleman. Buy  that lovely bunch. Will you, gentleman?<lb n="50337"/></said> </p>
            <p> The blue flowers which she lifted towards him and her <lb n="50338"/>
            young blue eyes seemed to him at that instant images of guile- <lb n="50339"/>
            lessness: and he halted till the image had vanished and he saw <lb n="50340"/>
            only her ragged dress and damp coarse hair and  hoydenish <lb n="50341"/>
            face.> <lb n="50342"/>
            <said who="???">―Do, gentleman! Don't forget your own girl, sir!<lb n="50343"/> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―I have no money, said Stephen. <lb n="50344"/> </said>
            <said who="???">―Buy them lovely ones, will you, sir? Only a penny.<lb n="50345"/> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Did you hear what I said? asked Stephen, bending towards <lb n="50346"/>
            her. I told you I had no money. I tell you again now.<lb n="50347"/> </said>
            <said who="???">―Well, sure, you will some day, sir, please God, the girl <lb n="50348"/>
            answered after an instant.<lb n="50349"/> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Possibly, said Stephen, but I don't think it likely. <lb n="50350"/></said> </p>
            <p> He left her quickly, fearing that her intimacy might turn to <lb n="50351"/>
            gibing and wishing to be out of the way before she offered her <lb n="50352"/>
            ware to another, a tourist from England or a student of Trinity. <place><location><geo>53.342300 -6.259747</geo></location><placeName> <lb n="50353"/>
            Grafton Street</placeName></place>, along which he walked prolonged that moment <lb n="50354"/>
            of discouraged poverty. In the roadway at the head of the street <lb n="50355"/>
            a slab was set to the memory of <persName>Wolfe Tone</persName> and he remem- <lb n="50356"/>
            bered having been present with his father at its laying. He re- <lb n="50357"/>
            membered with bitterness that scene of tawdry tribute. There <lb n="50358"/>
            were four French delegates in a brake and one, a plump smiling <lb n="50359"/>
            young man, held, wedged on a stick,  a card on which were <lb n="50360"/>
            printed the words: <seg xml:lang="fr">Vive l'Irlande!</seg><lb n="50361"/> </p>
            <p> But the trees in <place><location><geo>53.338174 -6.259119</geo></location><placeName>Stephen's Green</placeName></place> were fragrant of rain and <lb n="50362"/>
            the rainsodden earth gave forth its mortal odour, a faint in- <lb n="50363"/>
            cense rising upward through the mould from many hearts. The <lb n="50364"/>
            soul of the gallant venal city which his elders had told him of <lb n="50365"/>
            had shrunk with time to a faint mortal odour rising from the <lb n="50366"/>
            earth and he knew that in a moment when he entered the <lb n="50367"/>
            sombre college he would be conscious of a corruption other <lb n="50368"/>
            than that of <persName>Buck Egan</persName> and <persName>Burnchapel Whaley</persName>.<lb n="50369"/> </p>
            <p> It was too late to go upstairs to the French class. He crossed <lb n="50370"/>
            the hall and took the corridor to the left which led to the <lb n="50371"/>
            physics theatre. The corridor was dark and silent but not un- <lb n="50372"/>
            watchful. Why did he feel that it was not unwatchful? Was it <lb n="50373"/>
            because he had heard that in <persName>Buck Whaley</persName>'s time there was a <lb n="50374"/>
            secret staircase there? Or was the jesuit house extraterritorial <lb n="50375"/>
            and was he walking among aliens? The <placeName>Ireland</placeName>of <persName>Tone</persName> and of <lb n="50376"/>
            <persName>Parnell</persName> seemed to have receded in space.<lb n="50377"/> </p>
            <p> He opened the door of the theatre and halted in the chilly <lb n="50378"/>
            grey light that struggled through the dusty windows. A figure <lb n="50379"/>
            was crouching before the large grate and by its leanness and <lb n="50380"/>
            greyness he knew that it was the dean of studies lighting the <lb n="50381"/>
            fire. Stephen closed the door quietly and approached the fire- <lb n="50382"/>
            place. <lb n="50383"/>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Good morning, sir! Can I help you?<lb n="50384"/></said> </p>
            <p> The priest looked up quickly and said: <lb n="50385"/>
            <said who="???">―One moment now, Mr Dedalus, and you will see. There is <lb n="50386"/>
            an art in lighting a fire. We have the liberal arts and we have <lb n="50387"/>
            the useful arts. This is one of the useful arts.<lb n="50388"/> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―I will try to learn it, said Stephen.<lb n="50389"/> </said>
            <said who="???">―Not too much coal, said the dean, working briskly at his <lb n="50390"/>
            task, that is one of the secrets.<lb n="50391"/></said> </p>
            <p> He produced four candle butts from the sidepockets of his <lb n="50392"/>
            soutane and placed them deftly among the coals and twisted <lb n="50393"/>
            papers. Stephen watched him in silence. Kneeling thus on the <lb n="50394"/>
            flagstone to kindle the fire and busied with the disposition of <lb n="50395"/>
            his wisps of paper and candle butts he seemed more than ever a <lb n="50396"/>
            humble server making ready the place of sacrifice in an empty <lb n="50397"/>
            temple, a levite of the Lord. Like a levite's robe of plain linen <lb n="50398"/>
            the faded worn soutane draped the kneeling figure of one <lb n="50399"/>
            whom the canonicals or the  bellbordered ephod would irk and <lb n="50400"/>
            trouble. His very body had waxed old in lowly service of the <lb n="50401"/>
            Lord – in tending the fire upon the altar, in bearing tidings se- <lb n="50402"/>
            cretly, in waiting upon worldlings, in striking swiftly when <lb n="50403"/>
            bidden – and yet had remained ungraced by aught of saintly or <lb n="50404"/>
            of prelatic beauty. Nay, his very soul had waxed old in that <lb n="50405"/>
            service without growing towards light and beauty or spreading <lb n="50406"/>
            abroad a sweet odour of her sanctity – a mortified will no more <lb n="50407"/>
            responsive to the thrill of its obedience than was to the thrill of <lb n="50408"/>
            love or combat his aging body, spare and sinewy, greyed with a <lb n="50409"/>
            silverpointed down.<lb n="50410"/> </p>
            <p> The dean rested back on his hunkers and watched the sticks <lb n="50411"/>
            catch. Stephen, to fill the silence, said: <lb n="50412"/>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―I am sure I could not light a fire.<lb n="50413"/> </said>
            <said who="???">―You are an artist, are you not, Mr Dedalus? said the dean, <lb n="50414"/>
            glancing up and blinking his pale eyes. The object of the artist <lb n="50415"/>
            is the creation of the beautiful. What the beautiful is is another <lb n="50416"/>
            question.<lb n="50417"/></said> </p>
            <p> He rubbed his hands slowly and drily over the difficulty. <lb n="50418"/>
            <said who="???">―Can you solve that question now? he asked.<lb n="50419"/> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Aquinas, answered Stephen, says <seg xml:lang="la">Pulcra sunt quae visa <lb n="50420"/>
            placent</seg>.<lb n="50421"/> </said>
            <said who="???">―This fire before us, said the dean, will be pleasing to the eye. <lb n="50422"/>
            Will it therefore be beautiful?<lb n="50423"/> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―In so far as it is apprehended by the sight, which I suppose <lb n="50424"/>
            means here esthetic intellection, it will be beautiful. But Aqui- <lb n="50425"/>
            nas also says <seg xml:lang="la">Bonum est in quod tendit appetitus</seg>. In so far as it <lb n="50426"/>
            satisfies the animal craving for warmth fire is a good. In hell <lb n="50427"/>
            however it is an evil.<lb n="50428"/> </said>
            <said who="???">―Quite so, said the dean, you have certainly hit the nail on the <lb n="50429"/>
            head.<lb n="50430"/></said> </p>
            <p> He rose nimbly and went towards the door, set it ajar and <lb n="50431"/>
            said: <lb n="50432"/>
            <said who="???">―A draught is said to be a help in these matters.<lb n="50433"/></said> </p>
            <p> As he came back to the hearth, limping slightly but with a <lb n="50434"/>
            brisk step, Stephen saw the silent soul of a jesuit look out at <lb n="50435"/>
            him from the pale loveless eyes. Like Ignatius he was lame but <lb n="50436"/>
            in his eyes burned no spark of Ignatius' enthusiasm. Even the <lb n="50437"/>
            legendary craft of the company, a craft subtler and more secret <lb n="50438"/>
            than its fabled books of secret subtle wisdom, had not fired his <lb n="50439"/>
            soul with the energy of apostleship. It seemed as if he used the <lb n="50440"/>
            shifts and lore and cunning of the world, as bidden to do, for <lb n="50441"/>
            the greater glory of God, without joy in their handling or <lb n="50442"/>
            hatred of that in them which was evil but turning them, with a <lb n="50443"/>
            firm gesture of obedience, back upon themselves: and for all <lb n="50444"/>
            this silent service it seemed as if he loved not at all the master <lb n="50445"/>
            and little, if at all, the ends he served. <seg xml:lang="la">Similiter atque senis <lb n="50446"/>
            baculus</seg>, he was, as the founder would have had him, like a <lb n="50447"/>
            staff in an old man's hand, to be left in a corner, to be leaned <lb n="50448"/>
            on in the road at nightfall or in stress of weather,  to lie with a <lb n="50449"/>
            lady's nosegay on a garden seat, to be raised in menace.<lb n="50450"/> </p>
            <p> The dean returned to the hearth and began to stroke his <lb n="50451"/>
            chin. <lb n="50452"/>
            <said who="???">―When may we expect to have something from you on the <lb n="50453"/>
            esthetic question? he asked.<lb n="50454"/> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―From me! said Stephen in astonishment. I stumble on  an idea <lb n="50455"/>
            once a fortnight if I am lucky.<lb n="50456"/> </said>
            <said who="???">―These questions are very profound, Mr Dedalus, said the <lb n="50457"/>
            dean. It is like looking down from the <place><location><geo>53.545240 -7.943510</geo></location><placeName>cliffs of Moher</placeName></place> into the <lb n="50458"/>
            depths. Many go down into the depths and never come up. <lb n="50459"/>
            Only the trained diver can go down into those depths and <lb n="50460"/>
            explore them and come to the surface again.<lb n="50461"/> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―If you mean speculation, sir, said Stephen, I also am sure <lb n="50462"/>
            that there is no such thing  as free thinking inasmuch as all <lb n="50463"/>
            thinking must be bound by its own laws.<lb n="50464"/> </said>
            <said who="???">―Ha!<lb n="50465"/> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―For my purpose I can work on at present by the light of one <lb n="50466"/>

            <said who="???">―I see. I quite see your point.<lb n="50468"/> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―I need them only for my own use and guidance until I have <lb n="50469"/>
            done something for myself by their light. If the lamp smokes or <lb n="50470"/>
            smells I shall try to trim it. If it does not give light enough I <lb n="50471"/>
            shall sell it and buy or borrow another.<lb n="50472"/> </said>
            <said who="???">―Epictetus also had a lamp, said the dean, which was sold for <lb n="50473"/>
            a fancy price after his death. It was the lamp he wrote his <lb n="50474"/>
            philosophical dissertations by. You know Epictetus?<lb n="50475"/> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―An old gentleman, said Stephen coarsely, who said that the <lb n="50476"/>
            soul is very like a bucketful of water.<lb n="50477"/> </said>
            <said who="???">―He tells us in his homely way, the dean went on, that he put <lb n="50478"/>
            an iron lamp before a statue of one of the gods and that a thief <lb n="50479"/>
            stole the lamp. What did the philosopher do? He reflected that <lb n="50480"/>
            it was in the character of a thief to steal and determined to buy <lb n="50481"/>
            an earthen lamp next day instead of the iron lamp.<lb n="50482"/></said> </p>
            <p> A smell  of molten  tallow came up from the dean's candle <lb n="50483"/>
            butts and fused itself in Stephen's consciousness with the jingle <lb n="50484"/>
            of the words, bucket and lamp and lamp and bucket. The <lb n="50485"/>
            priest's voice too had a hard jingling tone. Stephen's mind <lb n="50486"/>
            halted by instinct, checked by the strange tone and the  imagery <lb n="50487"/>
            and by the priest's face which seemed like an unlit lamp or a <lb n="50488"/>
            reflector hung in a false focus. What lay behind it or within it? <lb n="50489"/>
            A dull torpor of the soul or the dullness of the thundercloud, <lb n="50490"/>
            charged with intellection and capable of the gloom of God? <lb n="50491"/>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―I meant a different kind of lamp, sir, said Stephen.<lb n="50492"/> </said>
            <said who="???">―Undoubtedly, said the dean.<lb n="50493"/> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―One difficulty, said Stephen, in esthetic discussion is to <lb n="50494"/>
            know whether words are being used according to the literary <lb n="50495"/>
            tradition or according to the tradition of the marketplace. I <lb n="50496"/>
            remember a sentence of Newman's in which he says of the <lb n="50497"/>
            Blessed Virgin that she was detained in the full company of the <lb n="50498"/>

            <said who="???">―Yes, yes: I see, said the dean quickly, I quite catch the point: <lb n="50503"/>

            <p> He thrust forward his under jaw and uttered a dry short <lb n="50505"/>
            cough. <lb n="50506"/>
            <said who="???">―To return to the lamp, he said, the feeding of it is also a nice <lb n="50507"/>
            problem. You must choose the pure oil and you must be careful <lb n="50508"/>
            when you pour it in not to overflow it, not to pour in more <lb n="50509"/>
            than the funnel can hold.<lb n="50510"/> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―What funnel? asked Stephen.<lb n="50511"/> </said>

            <p> His courtesy of manner rang a little false and Stephen looked <lb n="50523"/>
            at the English convert with the same eyes as the elder brother in <lb n="50524"/>
            the parable may have turned on the prodigal. A humble fol- <lb n="50525"/>
            lower in the wake of clamorous conversions,  a poor English- <lb n="50526"/>
            man in Ireland, he seemed to have entered on the stage of jesuit <lb n="50527"/>
            history when that strange play of intrigue and suffering and <lb n="50528"/>
            envy and struggle and indignity had been all but given through <lb n="50529"/>
            – a latecomer, a tardy spirit.  From what had he set out? Per- <lb n="50530"/>
            haps he had been born and bred among serious dissenters, <lb n="50531"/>
            seeing salvation in Jesus only and abhorring the vain pomps of <lb n="50532"/>
            the establishment. Had he felt the need of an implicit faith <lb n="50533"/>
            amid the welter of sectarianism and the jargon of its turbulent <lb n="50534"/>
            schisms, six principle men, peculiar people, seed and snake <lb n="50535"/>
            baptists, supralapsarian dogmatists? Had he found the true <lb n="50536"/>
            church all of a sudden in winding up to the end like a reel of <lb n="50537"/>
            cotton some finespun line of reasoning upon insufflation or the <lb n="50538"/>
            imposition of hands or the procession of the Holy Ghost? Or <lb n="50539"/>
            had Lord Christ touched him and bidden him follow, like that <lb n="50540"/>
            disciple who had sat at the receipt of custom, as he sat by the <lb n="50541"/>
            door of some zincroofed chapel, yawning and telling over his <lb n="50542"/>
            church pence?<lb n="50543"/> </p>
            <p> The dean repeated the word yet again. <lb n="50544"/>
            <said who="???">―Tundish! Well now, that is interesting!<lb n="50545"/> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―The question you asked me a moment ago seems to me more <lb n="50546"/>
            interesting. What is that beauty which the artist struggles to <lb n="50547"/>
            express from lumps of earth, said Stephen coldly.<lb n="50548"/></said> </p>
            <p> The little word seemed to have turned a rapier point of his <lb n="50549"/>
            sensitiveness against this courteous and vigilant foe. He felt <lb n="50550"/>
            with a smart of dejection that the man to whom he was speak- <lb n="50551"/>
            ing was a countryman of Ben Jonson. He thought: <lb n="50552"/>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―The language in which we are speaking is his before it is <lb n="50553"/>
            mine. How different are the words <emph>home, Christ, ale, master</emph> on <lb n="50554"/>
            his lips and on mine! I cannot speak or write these words with- <lb n="50555"/>
            out unrest of spirit. His language, so familiar and so foreign, <lb n="50556"/>
            will always be for me an acquired speech. I have not made or <lb n="50557"/>
            accepted its words. My voice holds them at bay. My soul frets <lb n="50558"/>
            in the shadow of his language.<lb n="50559"/> </said>
            <said who="???">―And to distinguish between the beautiful and the sublime, <lb n="50560"/>
            the dean added. To distinguish between moral beauty and ma- <lb n="50561"/>
            terial beauty. And to inquire what kind of  beauty is proper to <lb n="50562"/>
            each of the various arts. These are some interesting points we <lb n="50563"/>
            might take up.<lb n="50564"/></said> </p>
            <p> Stephen, disheartened suddenly by the dean's firm dry tone, <lb n="50565"/>
            was silent. The dean also was silent: and through the silence a <lb n="50566"/>
            distant noise of many boots and confused voices came up the <lb n="50567"/>
            staircase. <lb n="50568"/>
            <said who="???">―In pursuing  these speculations, said the dean conclusively, <lb n="50569"/>
            there is however the danger of perishing of inanition. First you <lb n="50570"/>
            must take your degree. Set that before you as your first aim. <lb n="50571"/>
            Then, little by little, you will see your way. I mean in every <lb n="50572"/>
            sense, your way in life and in thinking. It may be uphill pedal- <lb n="50573"/>

            <said who="???">―You never know, said the dean brightly. We never can say <lb n="50577"/>

            <p> He left the hearth quickly and went towards the landing to <lb n="50580"/>
            oversee the arrival of the first arts' class.<lb n="50581"/> </p>
            <p> Leaning against the fireplace Stephen heard him greet briskly <lb n="50582"/>
            and impartially every student of the class and could almost see <lb n="50583"/>
            the frank smiles of the coarser students. A desolating pity be- <lb n="50584"/>
            gan to fall like a dew upon his easily embittered heart for this <lb n="50585"/>
            faithful servingman of the knightly Loyola, for this halfbrother <lb n="50586"/>
            of the clergy, more venal than they in speech, more steadfast of <lb n="50587"/>
            soul than they, one whom he would never call his ghostly fa- <lb n="50588"/>
            ther: and he thought how this man and his companions had <lb n="50589"/>
            earned the name of worldlings at the hands not of the un- <lb n="50590"/>
            worldly only but of the worldly also for having pleaded, during <lb n="50591"/>
            all their history, at the bar of God's justice for the souls of the <lb n="50592"/>
            lax and the lukewarm and the prudent.<lb n="50593"/> </p>
            <p> The entry of the professor was signalled by a few rounds of <place><location><geo>51.278708 0.521725</geo></location> <lb n="50594"/>
            <placeName>Kentish</placeName></place> fire from the heavy boots of those students who sat on <lb n="50595"/>
            the highest tier of the gloomy theatre under the grey cob- <lb n="50596"/>
            webbed windows. The calling of the roll began and the re- <lb n="50597"/>
            sponses to the names were given out in all tones until the name <lb n="50598"/>
            of Peter Byrne was reached. <lb n="50599"/>
            <said who="???">―Here!<lb n="50600"/></said> </p>
            <p> A deep bass note in response came from the upper tier, <lb n="50601"/>
            followed by coughs of protest along the other benches.<lb n="50602"/> </p>
            <p> The professor paused in his reading and called the next <lb n="50603"/>
            name: <lb n="50604"/>
            <said who="???">―Cranly!<lb n="50605"/></said> </p>
            <p> No answer. <lb n="50606"/>
            <said who="???">―Mr Cranly!<lb n="50607"/></said> </p>
            <p> A smile flew across Stephen's face as he thought of his <lb n="50608"/>
            friend's studies. <lb n="50609"/>
            <said who="???">―Try <place><location><geo>53.267776 -6.198408</geo></location><placeName>Leopardstown</placeName></place>! said a voice from the bench behind.<lb n="50610"/></said> </p>
            <p> Stephen glanced up quickly but Moynihan's snoutish face <lb n="50611"/>
            outlined on the grey light was impassive. A formula was given <lb n="50612"/>
            out. Amid the rustling of the notebooks Stephen turned back <lb n="50613"/>
            again and said: <lb n="50614"/>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Give me some paper for God' sake.<lb n="50615"/> </said>
            <said who="???">―Are you as bad as that? asked Moynihan with a broad grin.<lb n="50616"/></said> </p>
            <p> He tore a sheet from his scribbler and passed it down, whis- <lb n="50617"/>

            <said who="???">―In case of necessity any layman or woman can do it.<lb n="50619"/></said> </p>
            <p> The formula which he wrote obediently on the sheet of <lb n="50620"/>
            paper, the coiling and uncoiling calculations of the professor, <lb n="50621"/>
            the spectrelike symbols of force and velocity fascinated and <lb n="50622"/>
            jaded Stephen's mind. He had heard some say that the old <lb n="50623"/>
            professor was an atheist freemason. O the grey dull day! It <lb n="50624"/>
            seemed a limbo of painless patient consciousness through <lb n="50625"/>
            which souls of mathematicians might wander, projecting long <lb n="50626"/>
            slender fabrics from plane to plane of ever rarer and paler <lb n="50627"/>
            twilight, radiating swift eddies to the last verges of a universe <lb n="50628"/>
            ever vaster, farther and more impalpable. <lb n="50629"/>
            <said who="???">―So we must distinguish between elliptical and ellipsoidal. <lb n="50630"/>
            Perhaps some of you gentlemen may be familiar with the works <lb n="50631"/>
            of Mr W. S. Gilbert. In one of his songs he speaks of the <lb n="50632"/>
            billiard sharp who is condemned to play: <lb n="50633"/>
            <lg type="song">

              <l>And elliptical billiard balls.</l> <lb n="50636"/>
            </lg>
            He means a ball having the form of the ellipsoid of the princi- <lb n="50637"/>

            <p> Moynihan leaned down towards Stephen's ear and mur- <lb n="50639"/>
            mured: <lb n="50640"/>
            <said who="???">―What price ellipsoidal balls! Chase me, ladies, I'm in the <lb n="50641"/>
            cavalry!<lb n="50642"/></said> </p>
            <p> His fellowstudent's rude humour ran like a gust through the <lb n="50643"/>
            cloister of Stephen's mind, shaking into gay life limp priestly <lb n="50644"/>
            vestments that hung upon the walls, setting them to sway and <lb n="50645"/>
            caper in a sabbath of misrule. The forms of the community <lb n="50646"/>
            emerged from the gustblown vestments, the dean of studies, <lb n="50647"/>
            the portly florid bursar with his cap of grey hair, the president, <lb n="50648"/>
            the little priest with feathery hair who wrote devout verses, the <lb n="50649"/>
            squat peasant form of the professor of economics, the tall form <lb n="50650"/>
            of the young professor of mental science discussing on the <lb n="50651"/>
            landing a case of conscience with his class like a giraffe crop- <lb n="50652"/>
            ping high leafage among a herd of antelopes, the grave troubled <lb n="50653"/>
            prefect of the sodality, the plump roundheaded professor of <lb n="50654"/>
            Italian with his rogue's eyes. They came ambling and stum- <lb n="50655"/>
            bling, tumbling and capering, kilting their gowns for leap frog, <lb n="50656"/>
            holding one another back, shaken with deep false laughter, <lb n="50657"/>
            smacking one another behind and laughing at their rude mal- <lb n="50658"/>
            ice, calling to one another by familiar nicknames, protesting <lb n="50659"/>
            with sudden dignity at some rough usage, whispering two and <lb n="50660"/>
            two behind their hands.<lb n="50661"/> </p>
            <p> The professor had gone to the glass cases on the sidewall <lb n="50662"/>
            from a shelf of which he took down a set of coils, blew away <lb n="50663"/>
            the dust from many points and, bearing it carefully to the table, <lb n="50664"/>
            held a finger on it while he proceeded with his lecture. He <lb n="50665"/>
            explained that the wires in modern coils were of a compound <lb n="50666"/>
            called platinoid lately discovered by F. W. Martino.<lb n="50667"/> </p>
            <p> He spoke clearly the initials and surname of the discoverer. <lb n="50668"/>
            Moynihan whispered from behind: <lb n="50669"/>
            <said who="???">―Good old Fresh Water Martin!<lb n="50670"/> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Ask him, Stephen whispered back with weary humour, if he <lb n="50671"/>
            wants a subject for electrocution. He can have me.<lb n="50672"/></said> </p>
            <p> Moynihan, seeing the professor bend over the coils, rose in <lb n="50673"/>
            his bench and, clacking noiselessly the fingers of his right hand, <lb n="50674"/>
            began to call with the voice of a slobbering urchin: <lb n="50675"/>
            <said who="???">―Please, teacher! Please, teacher! This boy is after saying a <lb n="50676"/>
            bad word, teacher.<lb n="50677"/> </said>
            <said who="???">―Platinoid, the professor said solemnly, is preferred to Ger- <lb n="50678"/>

            <p> A sharp <place><location><geo>54.407332 -7.024250</geo></location><placeName>Ulster</placeName></place> voice said from the bench below Stephen: <lb n="50685"/>
            <said who="???">―Are we  likely to be asked questions on applied science?<lb n="50686"/></said> </p>
            <p> The professor began to juggle gravely with the terms pure <lb n="50687"/>
            science and applied science. A heavybuilt student wearing gold <lb n="50688"/>
            spectacles stared with some wonder at the questioner. Moyni- <lb n="50689"/>
            han murmured from behind in his natural voice: <lb n="50690"/>
            <said who="???">―Isn't MacAlister a devil for his pound of flesh?<lb n="50691"/></said> </p>
            <p> Stephen looked down coldly on the oblong skull beneath <lb n="50692"/>
            him overgrown with tangled twinecoloured hair. The voice, the <lb n="50693"/>
            accent, the mind of the questioner offended him and he allowed <lb n="50694"/>
            the offence to carry  him towards wilful unkindness, bidding his <lb n="50695"/>
            mind think that the student's father would have done better <lb n="50696"/>
            had he sent his son to <place><location><geo>54.597285 -5.930120</geo></location><placeName>Belfast</placeName></place> to study and have saved some- <lb n="50697"/>
            thing on the trainfare by so doing.<lb n="50698"/> </p>
            <p> The oblong skull beneath did not turn to meet this shaft of <lb n="50699"/>
            thought and yet the shaft came back to its bowstring: for he <lb n="50700"/>
            saw in a moment the student's wheypale face. <lb n="50701"/>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―That thought is not mine, he said to himself quickly. It came <lb n="50702"/>
            from the comic Irishman in the bench behind. Patience. Can <lb n="50703"/>
            you say with certitude by whom the soul of your race was <lb n="50704"/>
            bartered and its elect betrayed – by the questioner or  by the <lb n="50705"/>
            mocker? Patience. Remember Epictetus. It is probably in his <lb n="50706"/>
            character to ask such a question at such a moment in such a <lb n="50707"/>
            tone and to pronounce the word <emph>science</emph> as a monosyllable.<lb n="50708"/></said> </p>
            <p> The droning voice of the professor continued to wind itself <lb n="50709"/>
            slowly round and round the coils it spoke of, doubling, <lb n="50710"/>
            trebling, quadrupling its somnolent energy as the coil multi- <lb n="50711"/>
            plied its ohms of resistance.<lb n="50712"/> </p>
            <p> Moynihan's voice called from behind in echo to a distant <lb n="50713"/>
            bell: <lb n="50714"/>
            <said who="???">―Closing time, gents!<lb n="50715"/></said> </p>
            <p> The entrance hall was crowded and loud with talk. On a <lb n="50716"/>
            table near the door were two photographs in frames and be- <lb n="50717"/>
            tween them a long roll of paper bearing an irregular tail of <lb n="50718"/>
            signatures. MacCann went briskly to and fro among the stu- <lb n="50719"/>
            dents, talking rapidly, answering rebuffs and leading one after <lb n="50720"/>
            another to the table. In the inner hall the dean of studies stood <lb n="50721"/>
            talking to a young professor, stroking his chin gravely and nod- <lb n="50722"/>
            ding his head.<lb n="50723"/> </p>
            <p> Stephen,  checked by the crowd at the door, halted irresol- <lb n="50724"/>
            utely. From under the wide falling leaf of a soft hat Cranly's <lb n="50725"/>
            dark eyes were watching him. <lb n="50726"/>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Have you signed? Stephen asked.<lb n="50727"/></said> </p>
            <p> Cranly closed his long thinlipped mouth, communed with <lb n="50728"/>
            himself an instant and answered: <lb n="50729"/>
            <said who="Cranly">―<seg xml:lang="la">Ego habeo.</seg><lb n="50730"/> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―What is it for?<lb n="50731"/> </said>
            <said who="Cranly">―<seg xml:lang="la">Quod?</seg><lb n="50732"/> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―What is it for?<lb n="50734"/></said> </p>
            <p> Cranly turned his pale face to Stephen and said blandly and <lb n="50734"/>
            bitterly: <lb n="50735"/>
            <said who="Cranly">―<seg xml:lang="la">Per pax universalis.</seg><lb n="50736"/></said> </p>
            <p> Stephen pointed to the Czar's photograph and said: <lb n="50737"/>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―He has the face of a besotted Christ.<lb n="50738"/></said> </p>
            <p> The scorn and anger in his voice brought Cranly's eyes back <lb n="50739"/>
            from a calm survey of the walls of the hall. <lb n="50740"/>
            <said who="Cranly">―Are you annoyed? he asked.<lb n="50741"/> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―No, answered Stephen.<lb n="50742"/> </said>
            <said who="Cranly">―Are you in bad humour?<lb n="50743"/> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―No.<lb n="50744"/></said> </p>
            <p> <said who="Cranly">―<seg xml:lang="la">Credo ut vos sanguinarius mendax estis</seg>, said Cranly, <seg xml:lang="la">quia <lb n="50745"/>
            facies vostra monstrat ut vos in damno malo humore estis.</seg><lb n="50746"/></said> </p>
            <p> Moynihan, on his way to the table, said in Stephen's ear: <lb n="50747"/>
            <said who="Moynihan">―MacCann is in tiptop form. Ready to shed the last drop. <lb n="50748"/>
            Brandnew world. No stimulants and votes for the bitches.<lb n="50749"/></said> </p>
            <p> Stephen smiled at the manner of this confidence and, when <lb n="50750"/>
            Moynihan had passed, turned again to meet Cranly's eyes. <lb n="50751"/>
            <said who="???">―Perhaps you can tell me, he said, why he pours his soul so <lb n="50752"/>
            freely into my ear. Can you?<lb n="50753"/></said> </p>
            <p> A dull scowl appeared on Cranly's forehead. He stared at <lb n="50754"/>
            the table where Moynihan had bent to write his name on the <lb n="50755"/>
            roll, and then said flatly: <lb n="50756"/>
            <said who="???">―A sugar!<lb n="50757"/> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">">―<seg xml:lang="la">Quis est in malo humore</seg>, said Stephen, <seg xml:lang="la">ego aut vos?</seg><lb n="50758"/></said> </p>
            <p> Cranly did not take up the taunt. He brooded sourly on his <lb n="50759"/>
            judgment and repeated with the same flat force: <lb n="50760"/>
            <said who="???">―A flaming bloody sugar, that's what he is!<lb n="50761"/></said> </p>
            <p> It was his epitaph for all dead friendships and Stephen won- <lb n="50762"/>
            dered whether it would ever be spoken in the same tone over <lb n="50763"/>
            his memory. The heavy lumpish phrase sank slowly out of <lb n="50764"/>
            hearing like a stone through a quagmire. Stephen saw it sink as <lb n="50765"/>
            he had seen many an other, feeling its heaviness depress his <lb n="50766"/>
            heart. Cranly's speech, unlike that of Davin, had neither rare <lb n="50767"/>
            phrases of Elizabethan English nor quaintly turned versions of <lb n="50768"/>
            Irish idioms. Its drawl was an echo of the quays of Dublin <lb n="50769"/>
            given back by a bleak decaying seaport, its energy an echo of <lb n="50770"/>
            the sacred eloquence of Dublin given back flatly by a <place><location><geo>52.979861 -6.048263</geo></location><placeName>Wicklow</placeName></place> <lb n="50771"/>
            pulpit.<lb n="50772"/> </p>
            <p> The heavy scowl faded from Cranly's face as MacCann <lb n="50773"/>
            marched briskly towards them from the other side of the hall. <lb n="50774"/>
            <said who="???">―Here you are! said MacCann cheerily.<lb n="50775"/> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Here I am! said Stephen.<lb n="50776"/> </said>
            <said who="???">―Late as usual. Can you not combine the progressive tendency <lb n="50777"/>
            with a respect for punctuality?<lb n="50778"/> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―That question is out of order, said Stephen. Next business.<lb n="50779"/></said> </p>
            <p> His smiling eyes were fixed on a silverwrapped tablet of milk <lb n="50780"/>
            chocolate which peeped out of the propagandist's breastpocket. <lb n="50781"/>
            A little ring of listeners closed round to hear the war of wits. A <lb n="50782"/>
            lean student with olive skin and lank black hair thrust his face <lb n="50783"/>
            between the two, glancing from one to the other at each phrase <lb n="50784"/>
            and seeming to try to catch each flying phrase in his open moist <lb n="50785"/>
            mouth. Cranly took a small grey handball from his pocket and <lb n="50786"/>
            began to examine it closely, turning it over and over. <lb n="50787"/>
            <said who="???">―Next business? said MacCann. Hom!<lb n="50788"/></said> </p>
            <p> He gave a loud cough of laughter, smiled broadly and <lb n="50789"/>
            tugged twice at  the strawcoloured goatee which hung from his <lb n="50790"/>
            blunt chin. <lb n="50791"/>
            <said who="???">―The next business is to sign the testimonial.<lb n="50792"/> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Will you pay me anything if I sign? asked Stephen.<lb n="50793"/> </said>
            <said who="???">―I thought you were an idealist, said MacCann.<lb n="50794"/></said> </p>
            <p> The gipsylike student looked about him and addressed the <lb n="50795"/>
            onlookers in an indistinct bleating voice. <lb n="50796"/>
            <said who="???">―By hell, that's a queer notion. I consider that notion to be a <lb n="50797"/>
            mercenary notion.<lb n="50798"/></said> </p>
            <p> His voice faded into silence. No heed was paid to his words. <lb n="50799"/>
            He turned his olive face, equine in expression, towards Ste- <lb n="50800"/>
            phen, inviting him to speak again.<lb n="50801"/> </p>
            <p> MacCann began to speak with fluent energy of the Czar's <lb n="50802"/>
            rescript, of Stead, of general disarmament, arbitration in cases <lb n="50803"/>
            of international disputes, of the signs of the times, of the new <lb n="50804"/>
            humanity and the new gospel of life which would make it the <lb n="50805"/>
            business of the community to secure as cheaply as possible the <lb n="50806"/>
            greatest possible happiness of the greatest possible number.<lb n="50807"/> </p>
            <p> The gipsy student responded to the close of the period by <lb n="50808"/>
            crying: <lb n="50809"/>
            <said who="???">―Three cheers for universal brotherhood!<lb n="50810"/> </said>
            <said who="???">―Go on, Temple, said a stout ruddy student near him. I'll <lb n="50811"/>
            stand you a pint after.<lb n="50812"/> </said>
            <said who="???">―I'm a believer in universal brotherhood, said Temple, <lb n="50813"/>
            glancing about him out of his dark oval eyes. Marx is only a <lb n="50814"/>
            bloody cod.<lb n="50815"/></said> </p>
            <p> Cranly gripped his arm tightly to check his tongue, smiling <lb n="50816"/>
            uneasily, and repeated: <lb n="50817"/>
            <said who="???">―Easy, easy, easy!<lb n="50818"/></said> </p>
            <p> Temple struggled to free his arm but continued, his mouth <lb n="50819"/>
            flecked by a thin foam: <lb n="50820"/>
            <said who="???">―Socialism was founded by an Irishman and the first man in <lb n="50821"/>
            Europe who preached the freedom of thought was Collins. Two <lb n="50822"/>
            hundred years ago. He denounced priestcraft. The philosopher <lb n="50823"/>
            of <place><location><geo>51.520987 -0.415985</geo></location><placeName>Middlesex</placeName></place>. Three cheers for John Anthony Collins!<lb n="50824"/></said> </p>
            <p> A thin voice from the verge of the ring replied: <lb n="50825"/>
            <said who="???">―Pip! pip!<lb n="50826"/></said> </p>
            <p> Moynihan murmured beside Stephen's ear: <lb n="50827"/>
            <said who="???">―And what about John Anthony's poor little sister: <lb n="50828"/>
            <lg>
              <l>Lottie Collins lost her drawers;</l> <lb n="50829"/>
              <l>Won't you kindly lend her yours?</l> <lb n="50830"/>
            </lg>
            </said></p>
            <p> Stephen laughed and Moynihan, pleased with the result, <lb n="50831"/>
            murmured again: <lb n="50832"/>
            <said who="???">―We'll have five bob each way on John Anthony Collins.<lb n="50833"/> </said>
            <said who="???">―I am waiting for your answer, said MacCann briefly.<lb n="50834"/> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―The affair doesn't interest me in the least, said Stephen <lb n="50835"/>
            wearily. You knew that well. Why do you make a scene about <lb n="50836"/>
            it?<lb n="50837"/> </said>
            <said who="???">―Good! said MacCann, smacking his lips. You are a reaction- <lb n="50838"/>
            ary then?<lb n="50839"/> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Do you think you impress me, Stephen asked, when you <lb n="50840"/>
            flourish your wooden sword?<lb n="50841"/> </said>
            <said who="???">―Metaphors! said MacCann bluntly. Come to facts.<lb n="50842"/></said> </p>
            <p> Stephen blushed and turned aside. MacCann stood his <lb n="50843"/>
            ground and said with hostile humour: <lb n="50844"/>
            <said who="???">―Minor poets, I suppose, are above such trivial questions as <lb n="50845"/>
            the question of universal peace.<lb n="50846"/></said> </p>
            <p> Cranly raised his head and held the handball between the <lb n="50847"/>
            two students by way of a peaceoffering, saying: <lb n="50848"/>
            <said who="???">―<seg xml:lang="la">Pax super totum sanguinarium globum.</seg><lb n="50849"/></said> </p>
            <p> Stephen, moving away the bystanders, jerked his shoulder <lb n="50850"/>
            angrily in the direction of the Czar's image, saying: <lb n="50851"/>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Keep your icon. If we must have a Jesus let us have a legit- <lb n="50852"/>
            imate Jesus.<lb n="50853"/> </said>
            <said who="???">―By hell, that's a good one! said the gipsy student to those <lb n="50854"/>
            about him. That's a fine expression. I like that expression <lb n="50855"/>
            immensely.<lb n="50856"/></said> </p>
            <p> He gulped down the spittle in his throat as if he were gulp- <lb n="50857"/>
            ing down the phrase and, fumbling at the peak of his tweed <lb n="50858"/>
            cap, turned to Stephen, saying: <lb n="50859"/>
            <said who="???">―Excuse me, sir, what do you mean by that expression you <lb n="50860"/>
            uttered just now?<lb n="50861"/></said> </p>
            <p> Feeling himself jostled by the students near him, he said to <lb n="50862"/>
            them: <lb n="50863"/>
            <said who="???">―I am curious to know now what he meant by that ex- <lb n="50864"/>
            pression.<lb n="50865"/></said> </p>
            <p> He turned again to Stephen and said in a whisper: <lb n="50866"/>
            <said who="???">―Do you believe in Jesus? I believe in man. Of course, I don't <lb n="50867"/>
            know if you believe in man. I admire you, sir. I admire the <lb n="50868"/>
            mind of man independent of all religions. Is that your opinion <lb n="50869"/>
            about the mind of Jesus?<lb n="50870"/> </said>
            <said who="???">―Go on, Temple, said the stout ruddy student returning, as <lb n="50871"/>
            was his wont, to his first idea, that pint is waiting for you.<lb n="50872"/> </said>
            <said who="???">―He thinks I'm an imbecile, Temple explained to Stephen, <lb n="50873"/>
            because I'm a  believer in the power of mind.<lb n="50874"/></said> </p>
            <p> Cranly linked his arms into those of Stephen and his admirer <lb n="50875"/>
            and said: <lb n="50876"/>
            <said who="???">―<seg xml:lang="la">Nos ad manum ballum jocabimus.</seg><lb n="50877"/></said> </p>
            <p> Stephen, in the act of being led away, caught sight of <lb n="50878"/>
            MacCann's flushed bluntfeatured face. <lb n="50879"/>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―My signature is of no account, he said politely. You are right <lb n="50880"/>
            to go your way. Leave me to go mine.<lb n="50881"/> </said>
            <said who="???">―Dedalus, said MacCann crisply, I believe you're a good fel- <lb n="50882"/>
            low but you have yet to learn the dignity of altruism and the <lb n="50883"/>
            responsibility of the human individual.<lb n="50884"/></said> </p>
            <p> A voice said: <lb n="50885"/>
            <said who="???">―Intellectual crankery is better out of this movement than in <lb n="50886"/>
            it.<lb n="50887"/></said> </p>
            <p> Stephen, recognising  the harsh tone of MacAlister's voice, <lb n="50888"/>
            did not turn in the direction of the voice. Cranly pushed sol- <lb n="50889"/>
            emnly through the throng of students, linking Stephen and <lb n="50890"/>
            Temple like a celebrant attended by his ministers on his way to <lb n="50891"/>
            the altar.<lb n="50892"/> </p>
            <p> Temple bent eagerly across Cranly's breast and said: <lb n="50893"/>
            <said who="???">―Did you hear MacAlister what he said? That youth is jealous <lb n="50894"/>
            of you. Did you see that? I bet Cranly didn't see that. By hell, I <lb n="50895"/>
            saw that at once.<lb n="50896"/></said> </p>
            <p> As they crossed the inner hall the dean of studies was in  the <lb n="50897"/>
            act of escaping from the student with whom he had been con- <lb n="50898"/>
            versing. He stood at the foot of the staircase, a foot on the <lb n="50899"/>
            lowest step, his threadbare  soutane gathered about him for <lb n="50900"/>
            the ascent with womanish care, nodding his head often and <lb n="50901"/>
            repeating: <lb n="50902"/>
            <said who="???">―Not a doubt of it, Mr Hackett! Very true! Not a doubt of it!<lb n="50903"/></said> </p>
            <p> In the middle of the hall the prefect of the college sodality <lb n="50904"/>
            was speaking earnestly, in a soft querulous voice, with a <lb n="50905"/>
            boarder. As he spoke he wrinkled a little his freckled brow and <lb n="50906"/>
            bit, between his phrases, at a tiny bone pencil. <lb n="50907"/>
            <said who="???">―I hope the matric men will all come. The first arts men are <lb n="50908"/>
            pretty sure. Second arts too. We must make sure of the new- <lb n="50909"/>
            comers.<lb n="50910"/></said> </p>
            <p> Temple bent again across Cranly, as they were passing <lb n="50911"/>
            through the doorway, and said in a swift whisper: <lb n="50912"/>
            <said who="???">―Do you know that he is a married man? He was a married <lb n="50913"/>
            man before they converted him. He has a wife and children <lb n="50914"/>
            somewhere. By hell, I think that's the queerest notion I ever <lb n="50915"/>
            heard! Eh?<lb n="50916"/></said> </p>
            <p> His whisper trailed off into sly cackling laughter. The mo- <lb n="50917"/>
            ment they were through the doorway Cranly seized him rudely <lb n="50918"/>
            by the neck and shook him, saying: <lb n="50919"/>
            <said who="???">―You flaming floundering fool! I'll take my dying bible there <lb n="50920"/>
            isn't a bigger bloody ape, do you know, than you in the whole <lb n="50921"/>
            flaming bloody world!<lb n="50922"/></said> </p>
            <p> Temple wriggled in his grip, laughing still with sly content, <lb n="50923"/>
            while Cranly repeated flatly at every rude shake: <lb n="50924"/>
            <said who="???">―A flaming flaring  bloody idiot!<lb n="50925"/></said> </p>
            <p> They crossed the weedy garden together. The president, <lb n="50926"/>
            wrapped in a heavy loose cloak, was coming towards them <lb n="50927"/>
            along one of the walks, reading his office. At the end of the <lb n="50928"/>
            walk he halted before turning and raised his eyes. The students <lb n="50929"/>
            saluted, Temple fumbling as before at the peak of his cap. They <lb n="50930"/>
            walked forward in silence. As they neared the alley Stephen <lb n="50931"/>
            could hear the thuds of the players' hands and the wet smacks <lb n="50932"/>
            of the ball and Davin's voice crying out excitedly at each <lb n="50933"/>
            stroke.<lb n="50934"/> </p>
            <p> The three students halted round the box on which Davin sat <lb n="50935"/>
            to follow the game. Temple, after a few moments, sidled across <lb n="50936"/>
            to Stephen and said: <lb n="50937"/>
            <said who="???">―Excuse me, I wanted to ask you do you believe that Jean <lb n="50938"/>
            Jacques Rousseau was a sincere man?<lb n="50939"/></said> </p>
            <p> Stephen laughed outright. Cranly, picking up the broken <lb n="50940"/>
            stave of a cask from the grass at his foot, turned swiftly and <lb n="50941"/>
            said sternly: <lb n="50942"/>
            <said who="???">―Temple, I declare to the living God if you say another word, <lb n="50943"/>
            do you know, to anybody on any subject I'll kill you <seg xml:lang="la">super <lb n="50944"/>
            spottum</seg>.<lb n="50945"/> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―He was like you, I fancy, said Stephen, an emotional man.<lb n="50946"/> </said>
            <said who="???">―Blast him, curse him! said Cranly broadly. Don't talk to him <lb n="50947"/>
            at all. Sure you might as well be talking, do you know, to a <lb n="50948"/>
            flaming chamberpot as talking to Temple. Go home, Temple. <lb n="50949"/>
            For God' sake go home.<lb n="50950"/> </said>
            <said who="???">―I don't care a damn about you, Cranly, answered Temple, <lb n="50951"/>
            moving out of reach of the uplifted stave and pointing at Ste- <lb n="50952"/>
            phen. He's the only man I see in this institution that has an <lb n="50953"/>
            individual mind.<lb n="50954"/> </said>
            <said who="???">―Institution! Individual! cried Cranly. Go home, blast you, for <lb n="50955"/>
            you're a hopeless bloody man.<lb n="50956"/> </said>
            <said who="???">―I'm an emotional man, said Temple. That's quite rightly <lb n="50957"/>
            expressed. And I'm proud that I'm an emotionalist.<lb n="50958"/></said> </p>
            <p> He sidled out of the alley, smiling slily. Cranly watched him <lb n="50959"/>
            with a blank expressionless face. <lb n="50960"/>
            <said who="???">―Look at him! he said. Did you ever see such a go-by-the- <lb n="50961"/>
            wall?<lb n="50962"/></said> </p>
            <p> His phrase was greeted by a strange laugh from a student <lb n="50963"/>
            who lounged against the wall, his peaked cap down on his eyes. <lb n="50964"/>
            The laugh, pitched in a high key and coming from a so muscu- <lb n="50965"/>
            lar frame, seemed like the whinny of an elephant. The student's <lb n="50966"/>
            body shook all over and, to ease his mirth, he rubbed both his <lb n="50967"/>
            hands delightedly over  his groins. <lb n="50968"/>
            <said who="???">―Lynch is awake, said Cranly.<lb n="50969"/></said> </p>
            <p> Lynch, for answer, straightened himself and thrust forward <lb n="50970"/>
            his chest. <lb n="50971"/>
            <said who="???">―Lynch puts out his chest, said Stephen, as a criticism of life.<lb n="50972"/></said> </p>
            <p> Lynch smote himself sonorously on the chest and said: <lb n="50973"/>
            <said who="???">―Who has anything to say about my girth?<lb n="50974"/></said> </p>
            <p> Cranly took him at the word and the two began to tussle. <lb n="50975"/>
            When their faces had flushed with the struggle they drew apart, <lb n="50976"/>
            panting. Stephen bent down towards Davin who, intent on the <lb n="50977"/>
            game, had paid no heed to the talk of the others. <lb n="50978"/>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―And how is my little tame goose? he asked. Did he sign too?<lb n="50979"/></said> </p>
            <p> Davin nodded and said: <lb n="50980"/>
            <said who="???">―And you, Stevie?<lb n="50981"/></said> </p>
            <p> Stephen shook his head. <lb n="50982"/>
            <said who="???">―You're a terrible man, Stevie, said Davin, taking the short <lb n="50983"/>
            pipe from his mouth. Always alone.<lb n="50984"/> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Now that you have signed the petition for universal peace, <lb n="50985"/>
            said Stephen, I suppose you will burn that little copybook I saw <lb n="50986"/>
            in your room.<lb n="50987"/></said> </p>
            <p> As Davin did not answer Stephen began to quote: <lb n="50988"/>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Long pace, fianna! Right incline, fianna! Fianna, by num- <lb n="50989"/>
            bers, salute, one, two!<lb n="50990"/> </said>
            <said who="???">―That's a different question, said Davin. I'm an Irish nation- <lb n="50991"/>
            alist, first and foremost. But that's you all out. You're a born <lb n="50992"/>
            sneerer, Stevie.<lb n="50993"/> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―When you make the next rebellion with hurleysticks, said <lb n="50994"/>
            Stephen, and want the indispensable informer, tell me. I can <lb n="50995"/>
            find you a few in this college.<lb n="50996"/> </said>
            <said who="???">―I can't understand you, said Davin. One time I hear you talk <lb n="50997"/>
            against English literature. Now you talk against the  Irish in- <lb n="50998"/>
            formers. What with your name and your ideas .... Are you Irish <lb n="50999"/>
            at all?<lb n="51000"/> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Come with me now to the office of arms and I will show you <lb n="51001"/>
            the tree of my family, said Stephen.<lb n="51002"/> </said>
            <said who="???">―Then be one of us, said Davin. Why don't you learn Irish? <lb n="51003"/>
            Why did you drop out of the league class after the first lesson?<lb n="51004"/> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―You know one reason why, answered Stephen.<lb n="51005"/></said> </p>
            <p> Davin tossed his head and laughed. <lb n="51006"/>
            <said who="???">―O, come now, he said. Is it on account of that certain young <lb n="51007"/>
            lady and Father Moran? But that's all in your own mind, <lb n="51008"/>
            Stevie. They were only talking and laughing.<lb n="51009"/></said> </p>
            <p> Stephen paused and laid a friendly hand upon Davin's <lb n="51010"/>
            shoulder. <lb n="51011"/>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Do you remember, he said, when we knew each other first. <lb n="51012"/>
            The first morning we met you asked me to show you the <lb n="51013"/>
            way to the matriculation class, putting a very strong stress on <lb n="51014"/>
            the first syllable. You remember? Then you used to address the <lb n="51015"/>
            jesuits as father, you remember? I ask myself about you: <emph>Is <lb n="51016"/>
            he as innocent as his speech?</emph><lb n="51017"/> </said>
            <said who="???">―I'm a simple person, said Davin. You know that. When you <lb n="51018"/>
            told me that night in Harcourt Street those things about your <lb n="51019"/>
            private life, honest to God, Stevie, I was not able to eat my <lb n="51020"/>
            dinner. I was quite bad. I was awake a long time that night. <lb n="51021"/>
            Why did you tell me those things?<lb n="51022"/> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Thanks, said Stephen. You mean I am a monster.<lb n="51023"/> </said>
            <said who="???">―No, said Davin, but I wish you had not told me.<lb n="51024"/></said> </p>
            <p> A tide began to surge beneath the calm surface of Stephen's <lb n="51025"/>
            friendliness. <lb n="51026"/>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―This race and this country and this life produced me, he <lb n="51027"/>
            said. I shall express myself as I am.<lb n="51028"/> </said>
            <said who="???">―Try to be one of us, repeated Davin. In your heart you are an <lb n="51029"/>
            Irishman but your pride is too powerful.<lb n="51030"/> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―My ancestors threw off their language and took on another, <lb n="51031"/>
            Stephen said. They allowed a handful of foreigners to subject <lb n="51032"/>
            them. Do you fancy I am going to pay in my own life and <lb n="51033"/>
            person debts they made? What for?<lb n="51034"/> </said>
            <said who="???">―For our freedom, said Davin.<lb n="51035"/> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―No honourable and sincere man, said Stephen, has given up <lb n="51036"/>
            to you his life and his youth and his affections from the days of <lb n="51037"/>
            Tone to those of Parnell but you sold him to the enemy or <lb n="51038"/>
            failed him in need or reviled him and left him for another. And <lb n="51039"/>
            you invite me to be one of you. I'd see you damned first.<lb n="51040"/> </said>
            <said who="???">―They died for their ideals, Stevie, said Davin. Our day will <lb n="51041"/>
            come yet, believe me.<lb n="51042"/></said> </p>
            <p> Stephen, following his own thought, was silent for an in- <lb n="51043"/>
            stant. <lb n="51044"/>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―The soul is born, he said vaguely, first in those moments I <lb n="51045"/>
            told you of. It has a slow and dark birth, more mysterious than <lb n="51046"/>
            the birth of the body. When the soul of a man is born in this <lb n="51047"/>
            country there are nets flung at it to hold it back from flight. <lb n="51048"/>
            You talk to me of nationality, language, religion. I shall try to <lb n="51049"/>
            fly by those nets.<lb n="51050"/></said> </p>
            <p> Davin knocked the ashes from his pipe. <lb n="51051"/>
            <said who="???">―Too deep for me, Stevie, he said. But a man's country comes <lb n="51052"/>
            first. Ireland first, Stevie. You can be a poet or a mystic after.<lb n="51053"/> </said>
            <said who="???">―Do you know what Ireland is? asked Stephen with cold <lb n="51054"/>
            violence. Ireland is the old sow that eats her farrow.<lb n="51055"/></said> </p>
            <p> Davin rose from his box and went towards the players, <lb n="51056"/>
            shaking his head sadly. But in a moment his sadness left him <lb n="51057"/>
            and he was hotly disputing with Cranly and the two players <lb n="51058"/>
            who had finished their game. A match of four was arranged, <lb n="51059"/>
            Cranly insisting, however, that his ball should be used. He let it <lb n="51060"/>
            rebound twice or thrice to his hand and then struck it strongly <lb n="51061"/>
            and swiftly towards the base of the alley, exclaiming in answer <lb n="51062"/>
            to its thud: <lb n="51063"/>
            <said who="???">―Your soul!<lb n="51064"/></said> </p>
            <p> Stephen stood with Lynch till the score began to rise. Then <lb n="51065"/>
            he plucked him by the sleeve to come away. Lynch obeyed, <lb n="51066"/>
            saying: <lb n="51067"/>
            <said who="???">―Let us eke go, as Cranly has it.<lb n="51068"/></said> </p>
            <p> Stephen smiled at this sidethrust. They passed back through <lb n="51069"/>
            the garden and out through the hall where the doddering porter <lb n="51070"/>
            was pinning up a notice in the frame. At the foot of the steps <lb n="51071"/>
            they halted and Stephen took a packet of cigarettes from his <lb n="51072"/>
            pocket and offered it to his companion. <lb n="51073"/>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―I know you are poor, he said.<lb n="51074"/> </said>
            <said who="???">―Damn your yellow insolence, answered Lynch.<lb n="51075"/></said> </p>
            <p> This second proof of Lynch's culture made Stephen smile <lb n="51076"/>
            again. <lb n="51077"/>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―It was a great day for European culture, he said, when you <lb n="51078"/>
            made up your mind to swear in yellow.<lb n="51079"/></said> </p>
            <p> They lit their cigarettes and turned to the right. After a <lb n="51080"/>
            pause Stephen began: <lb n="51081"/>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Aristotle has not defined pity and terror. I have. I say ...<lb n="51082"/></said> </p>
            <p> Lynch halted and said bluntly: <lb n="51083"/>
            <said who="???">―Stop! I won't listen! I am sick. I was out last night on a <lb n="51084"/>
            yellow drunk with Horan and Goggins.<lb n="51085"/></said> </p>
            <p> Stephen went on: <lb n="51086"/>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Pity is the feeling which arrests the mind in the presence of <lb n="51087"/>
            whatsoever is grave and constant in human sufferings and <lb n="51088"/>
            unites it with the human sufferer.  Terror is the feeling which <lb n="51089"/>
            arrests the mind in the presence of whatsoever is grave and <lb n="51090"/>
            constant in human sufferings and unites it with the secret <lb n="51091"/>
            cause.<lb n="51092"/> </said>
            <said who="???">―Repeat, said Lynch.<lb n="51093"/></said> </p>
            <p> Stephen repeated the definitions slowly. <lb n="51094"/>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―A girl got into a hansom a few days ago, he went on, in <place><location><geo>51.507351 -0.127758</geo></location> <lb n="51095"/>
            <placeName>London</placeName></place>. She was on her way to meet her mother whom she <lb n="51096"/>
            had not seen for many years. At the corner of a street the shaft <lb n="51097"/>
            of a lorry shivered the window of the hansom in the shape of a <lb n="51098"/>
            star. A long fine needle of the shivered glass pierced her heart. <lb n="51099"/>
            She died on the instant. The reporter called it a tragic death. It <lb n="51100"/>
            is not. It is remote from terror and pity according to the terms <lb n="51101"/>
            of my definitions.<lb n="51102"/> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">The tragic emotion, in fact, is a face looking two ways, <lb n="51103"/>
            towards terror and towards pity, both of which are phases of <lb n="51104"/>
            it. You see I use the word <emph>arrest</emph>. I mean that the tragic emotion <lb n="51105"/>
            is static. Or rather the dramatic emotion is. The feelings ex- <lb n="51106"/>
            cited by improper art are kinetic, desire or loathing. Desire <lb n="51107"/>
            urges us to possess, to go to something, loathing  urges us to <lb n="51108"/>
            abandon, to go from something. These are kinetic emotions. <lb n="51109"/>
            The arts which excite them, pornographical or didactic, are <lb n="51110"/>
            therefore improper arts. The esthetic emotion (I use the general <lb n="51111"/>
            term) is therefore static. The mind is arrested and raised above <lb n="51112"/>
            desire and loathing.<lb n="51113"/> </said>
            <said who="???">―You say that art must not excite desire, said Lynch. I told <lb n="51114"/>
            you that one day I wrote my name in pencil on the backside of <lb n="51115"/>
            the Venus of Praxiteles in the <place><location><geo>53.339706 -6.252188</geo></location><placeName>Museum</placeName></place>. Was that not desire?<lb n="51116"/> </said>
            <said who="???">―I speak of normal natures, said Stephen. You also told me <lb n="51117"/>
            that when you were a boy in that charming carmelite school <lb n="51118"/>
            you ate pieces of dried cowdung.<lb n="51119"/></said> </p>
            <p> Lynch broke again into a whinny of laughter and again <lb n="51120"/>
            rubbed both his hands over his groins but without taking them <lb n="51121"/>
            from his pockets. <lb n="51122"/>
            <said who="???">―O I did! I did! he cried.<lb n="51123"/></said> </p>
            <p> Stephen turned towards his companion and looked at him <lb n="51124"/>
            for a moment boldly in the eyes. Lynch, recovering from his <lb n="51125"/>
            laughter, answered his look from his humbled eyes. The long <lb n="51126"/>
            slender flattened skull beneath the long pointed cap brought <lb n="51127"/>
            before Stephen's mind the image of a hooded reptile. The eyes, <lb n="51128"/>
            too, were reptilelike in glint and gaze. Yet at that instant, <lb n="51129"/>
            humbled and alert in their look, they were lit by one tiny <lb n="51130"/>
            human point, the window of a shrivelled soul, poignant and <lb n="51131"/>
            selfembittered. <lb n="51132"/>
            <said who="???">―As for that, Stephen said in polite parenthesis, we are all <lb n="51133"/>
            animals. I also am an animal.<lb n="51134"/> </said>
            <said who="???">―You are, said Lynch.<lb n="51135"/> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">">―But we are just now in a mental world, Stephen continued. <lb n="51136"/>
            The desire and loathing excited by improper esthetic means are <lb n="51137"/>
            really not esthetic emotions not only because they are kinetic <lb n="51138"/>
            in character but also because they are not more than physical. <lb n="51139"/>
            Our flesh shrinks from what it dreads and responds to the <lb n="51140"/>
            stimulus of what it desires by a purely reflex action of the nerv- <lb n="51141"/>
            ous system. Our eyelid closes before we are aware that the fly is <lb n="51142"/>
            about to enter our eye.<lb n="51143"/> </said>
            <said who="???">―Not always, said Lynch critically.<lb n="51144"/> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">">―In the same way, said Stephen, your flesh responded to the <lb n="51145"/>
            stimulus of a naked statue but it was, I say, simply a reflex <lb n="51146"/>
            action of the nerves. Beauty expressed by the artist cannot <lb n="51147"/>
            awaken in us an emotion which is kinetic or a sensation which <lb n="51148"/>
            is purely physical. It awakens, or ought to awaken, or induces, <lb n="51149"/>
            or ought to induce, an esthetic stasis, an ideal pity or an ideal <lb n="51150"/>
            terror, a stasis called forth, prolonged and at last dissolved by <lb n="51151"/>
            what I call the rhythm of beauty.<lb n="51152"/> </said>
            <said who="???">―What is that exactly? asked Lynch.<lb n="51153"/> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Rhythm, said Stephen, is the first formal esthetic relation of <lb n="51154"/>
            part to part in any esthetic whole or of an esthetic whole to its <lb n="51155"/>
            part or parts or of any part to the esthetic whole of which it is a <lb n="51156"/>
            part.<lb n="51157"/> </said>
            <said who="???">―If that is rhythm, said Lynch, let me hear what you call <lb n="51158"/>
            beauty: and, please remember, though I did eat a cake of cow- <lb n="51159"/>
            dung once, that I admire only beauty.<lb n="51160"/></said> </p>
            <p> Stephen raised his cap as if in greeting. Then,  blushing <lb n="51161"/>
            slightly, he laid his hand on Lynch's thick tweed sleeve. <lb n="51162"/>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―We are right, he said, and the others are wrong. To speak of <lb n="51163"/>
            these things and to try to understand their nature and, having <lb n="51164"/>
            understood it, to try slowly and humbly and constantly to <lb n="51165"/>
            express, to press out again, from the gross earth or what it <lb n="51166"/>
            brings forth, from sound and shape and colour which are the <lb n="51167"/>
            prison gates of our soul, an image of the beauty we have come <lb n="51168"/>
            to understand – that is art.<lb n="51169"/></said> </p>
            <p> They had reached the <place><location><geo>53.342399 -6.238434</geo></location><placeName>canal bridge</placeName></place> and, turning from their <lb n="51170"/>
            course, went on by the trees. A crude grey light, mirrored in the <lb n="51171"/>
            sluggish water, and a smell of wet branches over their heads <lb n="51172"/>
            seemed to war against the course of Stephen's thought. <lb n="51173"/>
            <said who="???">―But you have not answered my question, said Lynch. What <lb n="51174"/>
            is art? What is the beauty it expresses?<lb n="51175"/> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―That was the first definition I gave you, you sleepyheaded <lb n="51176"/>
            wretch, said Stephen, when I began to try to think out the <lb n="51177"/>
            matter for myself. Do you remember the night? Cranly lost his <lb n="51178"/>
            temper and began to talk about Wicklow bacon.<lb n="51179"/> </said>
            <said who="???">―I remember, said Lynch. He told us about them flaming fat <lb n="51180"/>
            devils of pigs.<lb n="51181"/> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Art, said Stephen, is the human disposition of sensible or <lb n="51182"/>
            intelligible matter for an esthetic end. You remember the pigs <lb n="51183"/>
            and forget that. You are a distressing pair, you and Cranly.<lb n="51184"/></said> </p>
            <p> Lynch made a grimace at the raw grey sky and said: <lb n="51185"/>
            <said who="???">―If I am to listen to your esthetic philosophy give me at least <lb n="51186"/>
            another cigarette. I don't care about it. I don't even care about <lb n="51187"/>
            women. Damn you and damn everything. I want a job of five <lb n="51188"/>
            hundred a year. You can't get me one.<lb n="51189"/></said> </p>
            <p> Stephen handed him the packet of cigarettes. Lynch took the <lb n="51190"/>
            last one that remained, saying simply: <lb n="51191"/>
            <said who="???">―Proceed!<lb n="51192"/> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Aquinas, said Stephen, says that is beautiful the apprehen- <lb n="51193"/>
            sion of which pleases.<lb n="51194"/></said> </p>
            <p> Lynch nodded. <lb n="51195"/>
            <said who="???">―I remember that, he said. <seg xml:lang="la">Pulcra sunt quae visa placent.</seg><lb n="51196"/> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―He uses the word <seg xml:lang="la">visa</seg>, said Stephen, to cover esthetic appre- <lb n="51197"/>
            hension of all kinds, whether through sight or hearing or <lb n="51198"/>
            through any other avenue of apprehension. This word, though <lb n="51199"/>
            it is vague, is clear enough to keep away good and evil which <lb n="51200"/>
            excite desire and loathing. It means certainly a stasis and not a <lb n="51201"/>
            kinesis. How about the true? It produces also a stasis of the <lb n="51202"/>
            mind. You would not write your name in pencil across the <lb n="51203"/>
            hypothenuse of a rightangled triangle.<lb n="51204"/> </said>
            <said who="???">―No, said Lynch. Give me the hypothenuse of the Venus of <lb n="51205"/>
            Praxiteles.<lb n="51206"/> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Static therefore, said Stephen. Plato, I believe, said that <lb n="51207"/>
            beauty is the splendour of truth. I don't think that it has a <lb n="51208"/>
            meaning but the true and the beautiful are akin. Truth is beheld <lb n="51209"/>
            by the intellect which is appeased by the most satisfying <lb n="51210"/>
            relations of the intelligible:  beauty is beheld by the imagination <lb n="51211"/>
            which is appeased by the most satisfying relations of the sen- <lb n="51212"/>
            sible. The first step in the direction of truth is to understand the <lb n="51213"/>
            frame and scope of the intellect itself, to comprehend the act <lb n="51214"/>
            itself of intellection. Aristotle's entire system of philosophy <lb n="51215"/>
            rests upon his book of psychology and that, I think, rests on his <lb n="51216"/>
            statement that the same attribute cannot at the same time and <lb n="51217"/>
            in the same connection belong to and not belong to the same <lb n="51218"/>
            subject. The first step in the direction of beauty is to under- <lb n="51219"/>
            stand the frame and scope of the imagination, to comprehend <lb n="51220"/>
            the act itself of esthetic apprehension. Is that clear?<lb n="51221"/> </said>
            <said who="???">―But what is beauty? asked Lynch impatiently. Out with an- <lb n="51222"/>
            other definition. Something we see and like! Is that the best you <lb n="51223"/>
            and Aquinas can do?<lb n="51224"/> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Let us take woman, said Stephen.<lb n="51225"/> </said>
            <said who="???">―Let us take her! said Lynch fervently.<lb n="51226"/> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―The Greek, the Turk, the Chinese, the Copt, the Hottentot,<lb n="51227"/> </said>
            said Stephen, <said who="Stephen Dedalus">all admire a different type of female beauty. That <lb n="51228"/>
            seems to be a maze out of which we cannot escape. I see <lb n="51229"/>
            however two ways out. One is this hypothesis: that every physi- <lb n="51230"/>
            cal quality admired by men in women is in direct connection <lb n="51231"/>
            with the manifold functions of women for the propagation of <lb n="51232"/>
            the species. It may be so. The world, it seems, is drearier than <lb n="51233"/>
            even you, Lynch, imagined. For my part I dislike that way out. <lb n="51234"/>
            It leads to eugenics rather than to esthetic. It leads you out of <lb n="51235"/>
            the maze into a new gaudy lectureroom where MacCann, with <lb n="51236"/>
            one hand on <emph>The Origin of Species</emph> and the other hand on the <lb n="51237"/>
            new testament, tells you that you admired the great flanks of <lb n="51238"/>
            Venus because you felt that she would bear you burly offspring <lb n="51239"/>
            and admired her great breasts because you felt that she would <lb n="51240"/>
            give good milk to her children and yours.<lb n="51241"/> </said>
            <said who="???">―Then MacCann is a sulphuryellow liar, said Lynch energeti- <lb n="51242"/>
            cally.<lb n="51243"/> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―There remains another way out, said Stephen laughing.<lb n="51244"/> </said>
            <said who="???">―To wit? said Lynch.<lb n="51245"/> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―This hypothesis, Stephen began.<lb n="51246"/></said> </p>
            <p> A long dray laden with old iron came round the corner of <lb n="51247"/>
            <place><location><geo>53.339029 -6.241523</geo></location><placeName>sir Patrick Dun's</placeName></place> hospital covering the end of Stephen's speech <lb n="51248"/>
            with the harsh roar of jangled and rattling metal. Lynch closed <lb n="51249"/>
            his ears and gave out oath after oath till the dray had passed. <lb n="51250"/>
            Then he turned on his heel rudely. Stephen turned also and <lb n="51251"/>
            waited for a few moments till his companion's illhumour had <lb n="51252"/>
            had its vent. <lb n="51253"/>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―This hypothesis, Stephen repeated, is the other way out: <lb n="51254"/>
            that, though the same object may not seem beautiful to all <lb n="51255"/>
            people, all people who admire a beautiful object find in it <lb n="51256"/>
            certain relations which satisfy and coincide with the stages <lb n="51257"/>
            themselves of all esthetic apprehension. These relations of the <lb n="51258"/>
            sensible, visible to you through one form and to me through <lb n="51259"/>
            another, must be therefore the necessary qualities of beauty. <lb n="51260"/>
            Now, we can return to our old friend saint Thomas for another <lb n="51261"/>
            pennyworth of wisdom.<lb n="51262"/></said> </p>
            <p> Lynch laughed. <lb n="51263"/>
            <said who="???">―It amuses me vastly, he said, to hear you quoting him time <lb n="51264"/>
            after time like a jolly round friar. Are you laughing in your <lb n="51265"/>

            extends Aquinas will carry me all along the line. When we <lb n="51269"/>
            come to the phenomenon of artistic conception, artistic gesta- <lb n="51270"/>

            a new personal experience.<lb n="51272"/> </said>
            <said who="Lynch">Of course, said Lynch. After all Aquinas, in spite of his <lb n="51273"/>
            intellect, was exactly a good round  friar. But you will tell me <lb n="51274"/>
            about the new personal experience and new terminology some <lb n="51275"/>
            other day. Hurry up and finish the first part.<lb n="51276"/> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Who knows? said Stephen smiling. Perhaps Aquinas would <lb n="51277"/>
            understand me better than you. He was a poet himself. He <lb n="51278"/>
            wrote a hymn for Maundy Thursday. It begins with the words <lb n="51279"/>
            <seg xml:lang="la">Pange lingua gloriosi</seg>. They say it is the highest glory of the <lb n="51280"/>
            hymnal. It is an intricate and soothing hymn.  I like it: but there <lb n="51281"/>
            is no hymn that can be put beside that mournful and majestic <lb n="51282"/>
            processional song, the <seg xml:lang="la">Vexilla Regis</seg> of <seg xml:lang="la">Venantius Fortunatus</seg>.<lb n="51283"/></said> </p>
            <p> Lynch began to sing softly and solemnly in a deep bass <lb n="51284"/>

            and stopped. <lb n="51293"/>
            <said who="???">―Did you hear the results of the exams? he asked. Griffin was <lb n="51294"/>

            <p> In reply to a question of Stephen's his eyes and his voice <lb n="51303"/>

            <said who="???">―With women, Donovan? said Lynch.<lb n="51317"/></said> </p>
            <p> Donovan again laid his hand on his chest and said: <lb n="51318"/>
            <said who="???">―Our end is the acquisition of knowledge.<lb n="51319"/></said> </p>
            <p> Then he said quickly: <lb n="51320"/>
            <said who="???">―I hear you are writing some essay about esthetics.<lb n="51321"/></said> </p>
            <p> Stephen made a vague gesture of denial. <lb n="51322"/>
            <said who="???">―Goethe and Lessing, said Donovan, have written a lot on <lb n="51323"/>
            that subject, the classical school and the romantic school and <lb n="51324"/>
            all that. The <emph>Laocoon</emph> interested me very much when I read it. <lb n="51325"/>
            Of course it is idealistic, German, ultraprofound.<lb n="51326"/></said> </p>
            <p> Neither of the others spoke. Donovan took leave of them <lb n="51327"/>
            urbanely. <lb n="51328"/>
            <said who="???">―I must go, he said softly and benevolently. I have a strong <lb n="51329"/>

            <p> Lynch gazed after him, his lip curling in slow scorn till his <lb n="51335"/>
            face resembled a devil's mask: <lb n="51336"/>
            <said who="???">―To think that that yellow pancakeeating excrement can get a <lb n="51337"/>

            <p> They turned their faces towards <place><location><geo>53.339658 -6.249165</geo></location><placeName>Merrion Square</placeName></place> and went <lb n="51340"/>
            on for a little in silence. <lb n="51341"/>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―To finish what I was saying about beauty, said Stephen, the <lb n="51342"/>

            spond to the necessary phases of artistic apprehension. Find <lb n="51344"/>
            these and you find the qualities of universal beauty. Aquinas <lb n="51345"/>
            says: <seg xml:lang="la">ad pulcritudinem tria requiruntur, integritas, consonantia, <lb n="51346"/>
            claritas</seg>. I translate it so: <emph>Three things are needed for beauty, <lb n="51347"/>
            wholeness, harmony and radiance</emph>. Do these correspond to the <lb n="51348"/>
            phases of apprehension? Are you following?<lb n="51349"/> </said>
            <said who="???">―Of course, I am, said Lynch. If you think I have an excre- <lb n="51350"/>
            mentitious intelligence run after Donovan and ask him to listen <lb n="51351"/>
            to you.<lb n="51352"/></said> </p>
            <p> Stephen pointed to a basket which a butcher's boy had slung <lb n="51353"/>
            inverted on his head. <lb n="51354"/>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Look at that basket, he said.<lb n="51355"/> </said>
            <said who="???">―I see it, said Lynch.<lb n="51356"/> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―In order to see that basket, said Stephen, your mind first of <lb n="51357"/>
            all separates the basket from the rest of the visible universe <lb n="51358"/>
            which is not the basket. The first phase of apprehension is a <lb n="51359"/>
            bounding line drawn about the object to be apprehended. An <lb n="51360"/>
            esthetic image is presented to us either in space or in time. <lb n="51361"/>
            What is audible is presented in time, what is visible is presented <lb n="51362"/>
            in space. But temporal or spatial the esthetic image is first <lb n="51363"/>
            luminously apprehended as selfbounded and selfcontained <lb n="51364"/>
            upon the immeasurable background of space or time which is <lb n="51365"/>
            not it. You apprehend it as <emph>one</emph> thing. You see it as one whole. <lb n="51366"/>
            You apprehend its wholeness. That is <seg xml:lang="la">integritas</seg>.<lb n="51367"/> </said>
            <said who="???">―Bull's eye! said Lynch laughing. Go on.<lb n="51368"/> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Then, said Stephen, you pass from point to point, led by its <lb n="51369"/>
            formal lines; you apprehend it as balanced part against part <lb n="51370"/>
            within its limits; you feel the rhythm of its structure. In other <lb n="51371"/>
            words the synthesis of immediate perception is followed by the <lb n="51372"/>
            analysis of apprehension. Having first felt that it is <emph>one</emph> thing <lb n="51373"/>
            you feel now that it is a <emph>thing</emph>. You apprehend it as complex, <lb n="51374"/>
            multiple, divisible, separable, made up of its parts, the result of <lb n="51375"/>
            its parts and their sum, harmonious. That is <seg xml:lang="la">consonantia</seg>.<lb n="51376"/> </said>
            <said who="???">―Bull's eye again! said Lynch wittily. Tell me now what is <lb n="51377"/>
            <seg xml:lang="la">claritas</seg> and you win the cigar.<lb n="51378"/> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―The connotation of the word, Stephen said, is rather vague. <lb n="51379"/>
            Aquinas uses a term which seems to be inexact. It baffled me <lb n="51380"/>
            for a long time. It would lead you to believe that he had in <lb n="51381"/>
            mind symbolism or idealism, the supreme quality of beauty <lb n="51382"/>
            being a light from some other world, the idea of which the <lb n="51383"/>
            matter is but the shadow, the reality of which it is but the <lb n="51384"/>
            symbol. I thought he might mean that <seg xml:lang="la">claritas</seg> is the artistic <lb n="51385"/>
            discovery and representation of the divine purpose in anything <lb n="51386"/>
            or a force of generalisation which would make the esthetic <lb n="51387"/>
            image a universal one, make it outshine its proper conditions. <lb n="51388"/>
            But that is literary talk. I understand it so. When you have <lb n="51389"/>
            apprehended that basket as one thing and have then  analysed it <lb n="51390"/>
            according to its form and apprehended it as a thing you make <lb n="51391"/>
            the only synthesis which is logically and esthetically permiss- <lb n="51392"/>
            ible. You see that it is that thing which it is and no other thing. <lb n="51393"/>
            The radiance of which he speaks is the scholastic <seg xml:lang="la">quidditas</seg>, the <lb n="51394"/>
            <emph>whatness</emph> of a thing. This supreme quality is felt by the artist <lb n="51395"/>
            when the esthetic image is first conceived in his imagination. <lb n="51396"/>
            The mind in that mysterious instant Shelley likened beautifully <lb n="51397"/>
            to a fading coal. The instant wherein that supreme quality of <lb n="51398"/>
            beauty, the clear radiance of the esthetic image, is apprehended <lb n="51399"/>
            luminously by the mind which has been arrested by its whole- <lb n="51400"/>
            ness and fascinated by its harmony is the luminous silent stasis <lb n="51401"/>
            of esthetic pleasure, a spiritual state very like to that cardiac <lb n="51402"/>
            condition which the Italian physiologist Luigi Galvani, using a <lb n="51403"/>
            phrase almost as beautiful as Shelley's, called the enchantment <lb n="51404"/>
            of the heart.<lb n="51405"/></said> </p>
            <p> Stephen paused and, though his companion did not speak, <lb n="51406"/>
            felt that his words had called up around them a thoughten- <lb n="51407"/>
            chanted silence. <lb n="51408"/>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―What I have said, he began again, refers to beauty in the <lb n="51409"/>
            wider sense of the word, in the sense which the word has in the <lb n="51410"/>
            literary tradition. In the marketplace it has another sense. <lb n="51411"/>
            When we speak of beauty in the second sense of the term our <lb n="51412"/>
            judgment is influenced in the first place by the art itself and by <lb n="51413"/>
            the form of that art. The image, it is clear, must be set between <lb n="51414"/>
            the mind or senses of the  artist himself and the mind or senses <lb n="51415"/>
            of others. If you bear this in memory you will see that art <lb n="51416"/>
            necessarily divides itself into three forms progressing from one <lb n="51417"/>
            to the next. These forms are: the lyrical form, the form wherein <lb n="51418"/>
            the artist presents his image in immediate relation to himself; <lb n="51419"/>
            the epical form, the form wherein he presents his image in <lb n="51420"/>
            mediate relation to himself and to others; the dramatic form, <lb n="51421"/>
            the form wherein he presents his image in immediate relation to <lb n="51422"/>
            others.<lb n="51423"/> </said>
            <said who="???">―That you told me a few nights ago, said Lynch, and we <lb n="51424"/>
            began the famous discussion.<lb n="51425"/> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―I have a book at home, said Stephen, in which I have written <lb n="51426"/>
            down questions which are more amusing than yours were. In <lb n="51427"/>
            finding the answers to them I found the theory of esthetic <lb n="51428"/>
            which I am trying to explain. Here are some questions I set <lb n="51429"/>
            myself: <emph>Is a chair finely made tragic or comic? Is the portrait of <lb n="51430"/>
            Mona Lisa good if I desire to see it? Is the bust of sir Philip <lb n="51431"/>
            Crampton lyrical, epical or dramatic? Can excrement or a child <lb n="51432"/>
            or a louse be a work of art? If not, why not?</emph><lb n="51433"/> </said>
            <said who="???">―Why not, indeed? said Lynch laughing.<lb n="51434"/> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus"><emph>If a man hacking in fury at a block of wood</emph>, Stephen con- <lb n="51435"/>
            tinued, <emph>make there an image >of a cow is that image a work of <lb n="51436"/>
            >art? If not, why not?</emph><lb n="51437"/> </said>
            <said who="???">―That's a lovely one, said  Lynch laughing again. That has the <lb n="51438"/>
            true scholastic stink.<lb n="51439"/> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Lessing, said Stephen, should not have taken a group of <lb n="51440"/>
            statues to write of. The art, being inferior, does not present the <lb n="51441"/>
            forms I spoke of distinguished clearly one from another. Even <lb n="51442"/>
            in literature, the highest and most spiritual art, the forms are <lb n="51443"/>
            often confused. The lyrical form is in fact the simplest verbal <lb n="51444"/>
            vesture of an instant of emotion, a rhythmical cry such as ages <lb n="51445"/>
            ago cheered on the man who pulled at the oar or dragged <lb n="51446"/>
            stones up a slope. He who utters it is more conscious of the <lb n="51447"/>
            instant of emotion than of himself as feeling emotion. The <lb n="51448"/>
            simplest epical form is seen emerging out of lyrical literature <lb n="51449"/>
            when the artist prolongs and broods upon himself as the centre <lb n="51450"/>
            of an epical event and this form progresses till the centre of <lb n="51451"/>
            emotional gravity is equidistant from the artist himself and <lb n="51452"/>
            from others. The narrative is no longer purely personal. The <lb n="51453"/>
            personality of the artist passes into the narration itself, flowing <lb n="51454"/>
            round and round the persons and the action like a vital sea. <lb n="51455"/>
            This progress you will see easily in that old English ballad <lb n="51456"/>
            <emph>Turpin Hero</emph> which begins in the first person and ends in the <lb n="51457"/>
            third person. The dramatic form is reached when the vitality <lb n="51458"/>
            which has flowed and eddied round each person fills every <lb n="51459"/>
            person with such vital force that he or she assumes a proper <lb n="51460"/>
            and intangible esthetic life. The personality of the artist at first <lb n="51461"/>
            a cry or a cadence or a mood and then a fluid and lambent <lb n="51462"/>
            narrative finally refines itself out of existence, impersonalises <lb n="51463"/>
            itself, so to speak. The esthetic image in the dramatic form is <lb n="51464"/>
            life purified in and reprojected from the human imagination. <lb n="51465"/>
            The mystery of esthetic like that of material creation is accom- <lb n="51466"/>
            plished. The artist, like the God of the creation, remains within <lb n="51467"/>
            or behind or beyond or above his handiwork, invisible, refined <lb n="51468"/>
            out of existence, indifferent, paring his fingernails.<lb n="51469"/> </said>
            <said who="???">―Trying to refine them also out of existence, said Lynch.<lb n="51470"/></said> </p>
            <p> A fine rain began to fall from the high veiled sky and they <lb n="51471"/>
            turned into the duke's lawn to reach <place><location><geo>53.341522 -6.254893</geo></location><placeName>the national library</placeName></place> before <lb n="51472"/>
            the shower came. <lb n="51473"/>
            <said who="???">―What do you mean, Lynch asked surlily, by prating about <lb n="51474"/>

            der the arcade of the library. Cranly leaning against a pillar <lb n="51480"/>
            was picking his teeth with a sharpened match, listening to some <lb n="51481"/>
            companions. Some girls stood near the entrance door. Lynch <lb n="51482"/>
            whispered to Stephen: <lb n="51483"/>
            <said who="???">―Your beloved is  here.<lb n="51484"/></said> </p>
            <p> Stephen took his place silently on the step below the group <lb n="51485"/>
            of students, heedless of the rain which fell fast, turning his eyes <lb n="51486"/>
            towards her  from time to time. She too stood silently among <lb n="51487"/>
            her companions. She has no priest to flirt with, he thought with <lb n="51488"/>
            conscious bitterness, remembering how he had seen her last. <lb n="51489"/>
            Lynch was right. His mind, emptied of theory and courage, <lb n="51490"/>
            lapsed back into a listless peace.<lb n="51491"/> </p>
            <p> He heard the students talking among themselves. They <lb n="51492"/>
            spoke of two friends who had passed the final medical exam- <lb n="51493"/>
            ination, of the chances of getting places on ocean liners, of <lb n="51494"/>

            conscious of faint sweet music. His mind was waking slowly to <lb n="51526"/>
            a tremulous morning knowledge, a morning inspiration. A <lb n="51527"/>
            spirit filled him, pure as the purest water, sweet as dew, moving <lb n="51528"/>
            as music. But how faintly it was inbreathed, how passionlessly <lb n="51529"/>
            as if the seraphim themselves were breathing upon him! His <lb n="51530"/>
            soul was waking slowly, fearing to awake wholly. It was that <lb n="51531"/>
            windless hour of dawn when madness wakes and strange plants <lb n="51532"/>
            open to the light and the moth flies forth silently.<lb n="51533"/> </p>
            <p> An enchantment of the heart! The night had been enchanted. In <lb n="51534"/>
            dream or vision he had known the ecstasy of seraphic life. <lb n="51535"/>
            Was it an instant of enchantment only or long hours and days <lb n="51536"/>
            and years and ages?<lb n="51537"/> </p>
            <p> The instant of inspiration seemed now to be reflected from <lb n="51538"/>
            all sides at once from a multitude of cloudy circumstance of <lb n="51539"/>
            what had happened or of what might have happened. The in- <lb n="51540"/>
            stant flashed forth like a point of light and now from cloud on <lb n="51541"/>
            cloud of vague circumstance confused form  was veiling softly <lb n="51542"/>
            its afterglow. O! In the virgin womb of the imagination the <lb n="51543"/>
            word was made flesh. Gabriel the  seraph had come to the <lb n="51544"/>
            virgin's chamber. An afterglow deepened within his spirit, <lb n="51545"/>
            whence the white flame had passed, deepening to a rose and <lb n="51546"/>
            ardent light. That rose and ardent light was her strange wilful <lb n="51547"/>
            heart, strange that no man had known or would know, wilful <lb n="51548"/>
            from before the beginning of the world: and lured by that <lb n="51549"/>
            ardent roselike glow the choirs of the seraphim were falling <lb n="51550"/>
            from heaven.<lb n="51551"/> </p>
            <lg>
              <l>Are you not weary of ardent ways,</l> <lb n="51552"/>
              <l>Lure of the fallen seraphim?</l> <lb n="51553"/>
              <l>Tell no more of enchanted days.</l> <lb n="51554"/>
            </lg>
            <p> The verses passed from his mind to his lips and, murmuring <lb n="51555"/>
            them over, he felt the rhythmic movement of a villanelle pass <lb n="51556"/>
            through them. The roselike glow sent forth its rays of rhyme; <lb n="51557"/>
            ways, days, blaze, praise, raise. Its rays burned up the world, <lb n="51558"/>
            consumed the hearts of men and angels: the rays from the rose <lb n="51559"/>
            that was her wilful heart.<lb n="51560"/> </p>
            <lg>
              <l>Your eyes have set man's heart ablaze</l> <lb n="51561"/>
              <l>And you have had your will of him.</l> <lb n="51562"/>
              <l>Are you not weary of ardent ways?</l> <lb n="51563"/>
            </lg>
            <p> And then? The rhythm died away, ceased, began again to <lb n="51564"/>
            move and beat. And then? Smoke, incense ascending from the <lb n="51565"/>
            altar of the world.<lb n="51566"/> </p>
            <lg>
              <l>Above the flame the smoke of praise</l> <lb n="51567"/>
              <l>Goes up from ocean rim to rim.</l> <lb n="51568"/>
              <l>Tell no more of enchanted days.</l> <lb n="51569"/>
            </lg>
            <p> Smoke went up from the whole earth, from the vapoury <lb n="51570"/>
            oceans, smoke of her praise. The earth was like a swinging <lb n="51571"/>
            swaying smoking [swaying] censer, a ball of incense, an ellipsoidal ball. <lb n="51572"/>
            The rhythm died out at once; the cry of his heart was broken. <lb n="51573"/>
            His lips began to murmur the first verses over and over; then <lb n="51574"/>
            went on stumbling through half verses, stammering and <lb n="51575"/>
            baffled; then stopped. The heart's cry was broken.<lb n="51576"/> </p>
            <p> The veiled windless hour had passed and behind the panes <lb n="51577"/>
            of the naked window the morning light was gathering. A bell <lb n="51578"/>
            beat faintly very far away. A bird twittered; two birds, three. <lb n="51579"/>
            The bell and the birds ceased: and the dull white light  spread <lb n="51580"/>
            itself east and west, covering the world, covering the roselight <lb n="51581"/>
            in his heart.<lb n="51582"/> </p>
            <p> Fearing to lose all he raised himself suddenly on his elbow to <lb n="51583"/>
            look for paper and pencil. There was neither on the table; only <lb n="51584"/>
            the soup plate he had eaten the rice from for supper and the <lb n="51585"/>
            candlestick with its tendrils of tallow and its paper socket, <lb n="51586"/>
            singed by the last flame. He stretched his arm wearily towards <lb n="51587"/>
            the foot of the bed, groping with his hand in the pockets of the <lb n="51588"/>
            coat that hung there. His fingers found a pencil and then a <lb n="51589"/>
            cigarette packet.  He  lay back and, tearing open the packet, <lb n="51590"/>
            placed the last cigarette on the window ledge and began to <lb n="51591"/>
            write out the stanzas of the villanelle in small neat letters on the <lb n="51592"/>
            rough cardboard surface.<lb n="51593"/> </p>
            <p> Having written them out he lay back on the lumpy pillow, <lb n="51594"/>
            murmuring them again. The lumps of knotted flock under his <lb n="51595"/>
            head reminded him of the lumps of knotted horsehair in the <lb n="51596"/>
            sofa of her parlour on which he used to sit, smiling or serious, <lb n="51597"/>
            asking himself why he had come, displeased with her and with <lb n="51598"/>
            himself, confounded by the print of the Sacred Heart above the <lb n="51599"/>
            untenanted sideboard. He saw her approach him in a lull of the <lb n="51600"/>
            talk and beg him to sing one of his curious songs. Then he saw <lb n="51601"/>
            himself sitting at the old piano, striking chords softly from its <lb n="51602"/>
            speckled keys and singing, amid the talk which had risen again <lb n="51603"/>
            in the room, to her who leaned beside the mantelpiece a dainty <lb n="51604"/>
            song of the Elizabethans, a sad and sweet loth to depart, the <lb n="51605"/>
            victory chant of Agincourt, the happy air of Greensleeves. <lb n="51606"/>
            While he sang and she listened, or feigned to listen, his heart <lb n="51607"/>
            was at rest but when the quaint old songs had ended and he <lb n="51608"/>
            heard again the voices in the room he remembered his own <lb n="51609"/>
            sarcasm: the house where young men are called by their chris- <lb n="51610"/>
            tian names a little too soon.<lb n="51611"/> </p>
            <p> At certain instants her eyes seemed about to trust him but he <lb n="51612"/>
            had waited in vain. She passed now dancing lightly across his <lb n="51613"/>
            memory as she had been that night at the carnival ball. Her <lb n="51614"/>
            white dress a little lifted, a white spray nodding in her hair. She <lb n="51615"/>
            danced lightly in the round. She was dancing towards him and, <lb n="51616"/>
            as she came, her eyes were a little averted and a faint glow was <lb n="51617"/>
            on her cheek. At the pause in the chain of hands her hand had <lb n="51618"/>
            lain in his an instant, a soft merchandise. <lb n="51619"/>
            <said who="???">―You are a great stranger now.<lb n="51620"/> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Yes. I was born to be a monk.<lb n="51621"/> </said>
            <said who="???">―I am afraid you are a heretic.<lb n="51622"/> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Are you much afraid?<lb n="51623"/></said> </p>
            <p> For answer she had danced away from him along the chain <lb n="51624"/>
            of hands, dancing lightly and discreetly, giving herself to none. <lb n="51625"/>
            The white spray nodded to her dancing and when she was in <lb n="51626"/>
            shadow the glow was deeper on her cheek.<lb n="51627"/> </p>
            <p> A monk! His own image started forth a profaner of the <lb n="51628"/>
            cloister, a heretic franciscan, willing and willing not to serve, <lb n="51629"/>
            spinning like Gherardino da Borgo San Donnino a lithe web of <lb n="51630"/>
            sophistry and whispering in her ear.<lb n="51631"/> </p>
            <p> No, it was not his image. It was the image of the young <lb n="51632"/>
            priest in whose company he had seen her last, looking at him <lb n="51633"/>
            out of dove's eyes, toying with the pages of her Irish phrase- <lb n="51634"/>
            book. <lb n="51635"/>
            <said who="???">―Yes, yes, the ladies are coming round to us. I can see it every <lb n="51636"/>
            day. The ladies are with us. The best helpers the language has.<lb n="51637"/> </said>
            <said who="???">―And the church, Father Moran?<lb n="51638"/> </said>
            <said who="???">―The church too. Coming round too. The work is going <lb n="51639"/>
            ahead there too. Don't fret about the church.<lb n="51640"/></said> </p>
            <p> Bah! he had done well to leave the room in disdain. He had <lb n="51641"/>
            done well not to salute her on the steps of the library. He had <lb n="51642"/>
            done well to leave her to flirt with her priest, to toy with a <lb n="51643"/>
            church which was the scullerymaid of christendom.<lb n="51644"/> </p>
            <p> Rude brutal anger routed the last lingering instant of ecstasy <lb n="51645"/>
            from his soul. It broke up violently her fair image and flung the <lb n="51646"/>
            fragments on all sides. On all sides distorted reflections of her <lb n="51647"/>
            image started from his memory: the flowergirl in the ragged <lb n="51648"/>
            dress with damp coarse hair and a hoyden's face who had <lb n="51649"/>
            called herself his own girl and begged his handsel, the kitchen- <lb n="51650"/>
            girl in the next house who sang over the clatter of her plates <lb n="51651"/>
            with the drawl of a country singer the first bars of <emph>By <lb n="51652"/>
            Killarney's Lakes and Fells</emph>, a girl who had laughed gaily to see <lb n="51653"/>
            him stumble when the iron grating in the footpath near <place><location><geo>53.343835 -6.267562</geo></location><placeName>Cork <lb n="51654"/>
            Hill</placeName></place> had caught the broken sole of his shoe, a girl he had <lb n="51655"/>
            glanced at, attracted by her small ripe mouth as she passed out <lb n="51656"/>
            of Jacob's biscuit factory, who had cried to him over her shoul- <lb n="51657"/>
            der: <lb n="51658"/>
            <said who="???">―Do you like what you seen of me, straight hair and curly <lb n="51659"/>
            eyebrows?<lb n="51660"/></said> </p>
            <p> And yet he felt that, however he might revile and mock her <lb n="51661"/>
            image, his anger was also a form of homage. He had left the <lb n="51662"/>
            classroom in disdain that was not wholly sincere, feeling that <lb n="51663"/>
            perhaps the secret of her race lay behind those dark eyes upon <lb n="51664"/>
            which her long lashes flung a quick shadow. He had told him- <lb n="51665"/>
            self bitterly as he walked through the streets that she was a <lb n="51666"/>
            figure of the womanhood of her country, a batlike soul waking <lb n="51667"/>
            to the consciousness of itself in darkness and secrecy and lone- <lb n="51668"/>
            liness, tarrying a while, loveless and sinless, with her mild lover <lb n="51669"/>
            and leaving him to whisper of innocent transgressions in the <lb n="51670"/>
            latticed ear of a priest. His anger against her found vent in <lb n="51671"/>
            coarse railing at her paramour, whose name and voice and <lb n="51672"/>
            features offended his baffled pride: a priested peasant, with a <lb n="51673"/>
            brother a policeman in Dublin and a brother a potboy in <place><location><geo>53.338748 -9.181478</geo></location> <lb n="51674"/>
            <placeName>Moycullen</placeName></place>. To him she would unveil her soul's shy nakedness, <lb n="51675"/>
            to one who was but schooled in the discharging of a formal rite <lb n="51676"/>
            rather than to him, a priest of the eternal imagination, trans- <lb n="51677"/>
            muting the daily bread of experience into the radiant body of <lb n="51678"/>
            everliving life.<lb n="51679"/> </p>
            <p> The radiant image of the eucharist united again in an instant <lb n="51680"/>
            his bitter and despairing thoughts, their cries arising unbroken <lb n="51681"/>
            in a hymn of thanksgiving.<lb n="51682"/> </p>
            <lg>
              <l>Our broken cries and mournful lays</l> <lb n="51683"/>
              <l>Rise in one eucharistic hymn.</l> <lb n="51584"/>
              <l>Are you not weary of ardent ways?</l> <lb n="51585"/>
              <l>While sacrificing hands upraise</l> <lb n="51686"/>
              <l>The chalice flowing to the brim.</l> <lb n="51587"/>
              <l>Tell no more of enchanted days.</l> <lb n="51588"/>
            </lg>
            <p> He spoke the verses aloud from the first lines till the music <lb n="51689"/>
            and rhythm suffused his mind, turning it to quiet indulgence; <lb n="51690"/>
            then copied them painfully to feel them the better by seeing <lb n="51691"/>
            them; then lay back on his bolster.<lb n="51692"/> </p>
            <p> The full morning light had come. No sound was to be heard: <lb n="51693"/>
            but he knew that all around him life was about to awaken in <lb n="51694"/>
            common noises, hoarse voices, sleepy prayers. Shrinking from <lb n="51695"/>
            that life he turned towards the wall, making a cowl of the <lb n="51696"/>
            blanket and staring at the great overblown scarlet flowers of <lb n="51697"/>
            the tattered wallpaper. He tried to warm his perishing joy in <lb n="51698"/>
            their scarlet glow, imagining a roseway from where he lay <lb n="51699"/>
            upwards to heaven all strewn  with scarlet flowers. Weary! <lb n="51700"/>
            Weary! He too was weary of ardent ways.<lb n="51701"/> </p>
            <p> A gradual warmth, a languorous weariness passed over him <lb n="51702"/>
            descending along his spine from his closely cowled  head. He <lb n="51703"/>
            felt it descend and, seeing himself as he lay, smiled. Soon he <lb n="51704"/>
            would sleep.<lb n="51705"/> </p>
            <p> He had written verses for her again after ten years. Ten years <lb n="51706"/>
            before she had worn her shawl cowlwise about her head, send- <lb n="51707"/>
            ing sprays of her warm breath into the night air, tapping her <lb n="51708"/>
            foot upon the glassy road. It was the last tram; the lank brown <lb n="51709"/>
            horses knew it and shook their bells to the clear night in <lb n="51710"/>
            admonition. The conductor talked with the driver, both nod- <lb n="51711"/>
            ding often in the green light of the lamp. They stood on the <lb n="51712"/>
            steps of the tram, he on the upper, she on the lower. She came <lb n="51713"/>
            up to his step many times between their phrases and went <lb n="51714"/>
            down again and once or twice remained beside him forgetting <lb n="51715"/>
            to go down and then went down. Let be! Let be!<lb n="51716"/> </p>
            <p> Ten years from that wisdom of children to his folly. If he <lb n="51717"/>
            sent her the verses? They would be read out at breakfast amid <lb n="51718"/>
            the tapping of eggshells. Folly indeed! The brothers would <lb n="51719"/>
            laugh and try to wrest the page from each other with their <lb n="51720"/>
            strong hard fingers. The suave priest, her uncle, seated in his <lb n="51721"/>
            armchair, would hold the page at arm's length, read it smiling <lb n="51722"/>
            and approve of the literary form.<lb n="51723"/> </p>
            <p> No, no: that was folly. Even if he sent her the verses she <lb n="51724"/>
            would not show them to others. No, no: she could not.<lb n="51725"/> </p>
            <p> He began to feel that he had wronged her. A sense of her <lb n="51726"/>
            innocence moved him almost to pity her, an innocence he had <lb n="51727"/>
            never understood till he had come to the knowledge of it <lb n="51728"/>
            through sin, an innocence which she too had not understood <lb n="51729"/>
            while she was innocent or before the strange humiliation of her <lb n="51730"/>
            nature had first come upon her. Then first her soul had begun <lb n="51731"/>
            to live as his soul had when he had first sinned: and a tender <lb n="51732"/>
            compassion filled his heart as he remembered her frail pallor <lb n="51733"/>
            and her eyes, humbled and saddened by the dark shame of <lb n="51734"/>
            womanhood.<lb n="51735"/> </p>
            <p> While his soul had passed from ecstasy to languor where had <lb n="51736"/>
            she been? Might it be, in the mysterious ways of spiritual life, <lb n="51737"/>
            that her soul at those same moments had been conscious of his <lb n="51738"/>
            homage? It might be.<lb n="51739"/> </p>
            <p> A glow of desire kindled again his soul and fired and ful- <lb n="51740"/>
            filled all his body. Conscious of his desire she was waking from <lb n="51741"/>
            odorous sleep, the temptress of his villanelle. Her eyes, dark <lb n="51742"/>
            and with a look of languor, were opening to his eyes. Her <lb n="51743"/>
            nakedness yielded to him, radiant, warm, odorous and lavish- <lb n="51744"/>
            limbed, enfolded him like a shining cloud, enfolded him like <lb n="51745"/>
            water with a liquid life: and like a cloud of vapour or like <lb n="51746"/>
            waters circumfluent in space the liquid letters of speech, sym- <lb n="51747"/>

              <p>What birds were they?<lb n="51768"/> </p>
              <p>He stood on the steps of the library to look at them, leaning <lb n="51769"/>
              wearily on his ashplant. They flew round and round the jutting <lb n="51770"/>
              shoulder of a house in <place><location><geo>53.340809 -6.257636</geo></location><placeName>Molesworth</placeName></place> Street. The air of the late <lb n="51771"/>
              March evening made clear their flight, their dark darting <lb n="51772"/>
              quivering bodies flying clearly against the sky as against a <lb n="51773"/>
              limphung cloth of smoky tenuous blue.<lb n="51774"/> </p>
              <p> He watched their flight: bird after bird: a dark flash, a <lb n="51775"/>
              swerve, a flash again, a dart aside, a curve, a flutter of wings. <lb n="51776"/>
              He tried to count them before all their darting quivering bodies <lb n="51777"/>
              passed: six, ten, eleven: and wondered were they odd or even in <lb n="51778"/>
              number. Twelve, thirteen: for two came wheeling down from <lb n="51779"/>
              the upper sky. They were flying high and low but ever round <lb n="51780"/>
              and round in straight and curving lines and ever flying from left <lb n="51781"/>
              to right, circling about a temple of air.<lb n="51782"/> </p>
              <p> He  listened to their cries: like the squeak of mice behind the <lb n="51783"/>
              wainscot: a shrill twofold note. But the notes were long and <lb n="51784"/>
              shrill and whirring, unlike the cry of vermin, falling a third or a <lb n="51785"/>
              fourth and trilled as the flying beaks clove the air. Their cry <lb n="51786"/>
              was shrill and clear and fine and falling like threads of silken <lb n="51787"/>
              light unwound from whirring spools.<lb n="51788"/> </p>
              <p> The inhuman clamour soothed his ears in which his <lb n="51789"/>
              mother's sobs and reproaches murmured insistently and the <lb n="51790"/>
              dark frail quivering bodies wheeling and fluttering and swerv- <lb n="51791"/>
              ing round an airy temple of the tenuous sky soothed his eyes <lb n="51792"/>
              which still saw the image of his mother's face.<lb n="51793"/> </p>
              <p> Why was he gazing upwards from the steps of the porch, <lb n="51794"/>
              hearing their shrill twofold cry, watching their flight? For an <lb n="51795"/>
              augury of good or evil? A phrase of Cornelius Agrippa flew <lb n="51796"/>
              through his mind and then there flew hither and thither shape- <lb n="51797"/>
              less thoughts from Swedenborg on the correspondence of birds <lb n="51798"/>
              to things of the intellect and of how the creatures of the air <lb n="51799"/>
              have their knowledge and know their times and seasons be- <lb n="51800"/>
              cause they, unlike man, are in the order of their life and have <lb n="51801"/>
              not perverted that order by reason.<lb n="51802"/> </p>
              <p> And for ages men had gazed upward as he was gazing at <lb n="51803"/>
              birds in flight. The colonnade above him made him think <lb n="51804"/>
              vaguely of an ancient temple and the ashplant on which he <lb n="51805"/>
              leaned wearily of the curved stick of an augur. A sense of fear <lb n="51806"/>
              of the unknown moved in the heart of his weariness, a fear of <lb n="51807"/>
              symbols and portents, of the hawklike man whose name he <lb n="51808"/>
              bore soaring out of his captivity on osierwoven wings, of <lb n="51809"/>
              Thoth, the god of writers, writing with a reed upon a tablet <lb n="51810"/>
              and bearing on his narrow ibis head the cusped moon.<lb n="51811"/> </p>
              <p> He smiled as he thought of the god's image for it made him <lb n="51812"/>
              think of a bottlenosed judge in a wig, putting commas into a <lb n="51813"/>
              document which he held at arm's length and he knew that he <lb n="51814"/>
              would not have remembered the god's name but that it was like <lb n="51815"/>
              an Irish oath. It was folly. But was it for this folly that he was <lb n="51816"/>
              about to leave for ever the house of prayer and prudence into <lb n="51817"/>
              which he had been born and the order of life out of which he <lb n="51818"/>
              had come?<lb n="51819"/> </p>
              <p> They came back with shrill cries over the jutting shoulder of <lb n="51820"/>
              the house, flying darkly against the fading air. What birds were <lb n="51821"/>
              they? He thought that they must be swallows who had come <lb n="51822"/>
              back from the south. Then he was to go away? for they were <lb n="51823"/>
              birds ever going and coming, building ever an unlasting home <lb n="51824"/>
              under the eaves of men's houses and ever leaving the homes <lb n="51825"/>
              they had built to wander.<lb n="51826"/> </p>
              <lg>
                <l>Bend down your faces, Oona and Aleel.</l> <lb n="51827"/>
                <l>I gaze upon them as the swallow gazes</l> <lb n="51828"/>
                <l>Upon the nest under the eave before</l> <lb n="51829"/>
                <l>He wander the loud waters.</l> <lb n="51830"/>
              </lg>
              <p> A soft liquid joy like the noise of many waters flowed over <lb n="51831"/>
              his memory and he felt in his heart the soft peace of silent <lb n="51832"/>
              spaces of fading tenuous sky above the waters, of oceanic si- <lb n="51833"/>
              lence, of swallows flying through the seadusk over the flowing <lb n="51834"/>
              waters.<lb n="51835"/> </p>
              <p> A soft liquid joy flowed through the words where the soft <lb n="51836"/>
              long vowels hurtled noiselessly and fell away, lapping and <lb n="51837"/>
              flowing back and ever shaking the white bells of their waves in <lb n="51838"/>
              mute chime and mute peal and soft low swooning cry: and he <lb n="51839"/>
              felt that the augury he had sought in the wheeling darting birds <lb n="51840"/>
              and in the pale space of sky above him had come forth from his <lb n="51841"/>
              heart like a bird from a turret quietly and swiftly.<lb n="51842"/> </p>
              <p> Symbol of departure or of loneliness? The verses crooned in <lb n="51843"/>
              the ear of his memory composed slowly before his remember- <lb n="51844"/>
              ing eyes the scene of the hall on the night of the opening of the <lb n="51845"/>
              national theatre. He was alone at the side of the balcony, <lb n="51846"/>
              looking out of jaded eyes at the culture of Dublin in the stalls <lb n="51847"/>
              and at the tawdry scenecloths and human dolls framed by the <lb n="51848"/>
              garish lamps of the stage. A burly policeman sweated behind <lb n="51849"/>
              him and seemed at every moment about to act. The catcalls <lb n="51850"/>
              and hisses and mocking cries ran in rude gusts round the hall <lb n="51851"/>
              from his scattered fellowstudents. <lb n="51852"/>
              <said who="???">―A libel on Ireland!<lb n="51853"/> </said>
              <said who="???">―Made in Germany!<lb n="51854"/> </said>
              <said who="???">―Blasphemy!<lb n="51855"/> </said>
              <said who="???">―We never sold our faith!<lb n="51856"/> </said>
              <said who="???">―No Irish woman ever did it!<lb n="51857"/> </said>
              <said who="???">―We want no amateur atheists.<lb n="51858"/> </said>
              <said who="???">―We want no budding buddhists.<lb n="51859"/></said> </p>
              <p> A sudden soft hiss fell from the windows above him and he <lb n="51860"/>
              knew that the electric lamps had been switched on in the <lb n="51861"/>
              readers' room. He turned into the pillared  hall, now calmly lit, <lb n="51862"/>
              went up the staircase and passed in through the clicking turn- <lb n="51863"/>
              stile.<lb n="51864"/> </p>
              <p> Cranly was sitting over near the dictionaries. A thick book, <lb n="51865"/>
              opened at the frontispiece, lay before him on the wooden rest. <lb n="51866"/>
              He leaned back in his chair, inclining his ear like that of a <lb n="51867"/>
              confessor to the face of the medical student who was reading to <lb n="51868"/>
              him a problem from the chess page of a journal. Stephen sat <lb n="51869"/>
              down at his right and the priest at the other side of the  table <lb n="51870"/>
              closed his copy of <emph>The Tablet</emph> with an angry snap and stood up.<lb n="51871"/> </p>
              <p> Cranly gazed after him blandly and vaguely. The medical <lb n="51872"/>
              student went on in a softer voice: <lb n="51873"/>
              <said who="???">―Pawn to king's fourth.<lb n="51874"/> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―We had better go, Dixon, said Stephen in warning. He has <lb n="51875"/>
              gone to complain.<lb n="51876"/></said> </p>
              <p> Dixon folded the journal and rose with dignity, saying: <lb n="51877"/>
              <said who="???">―Our men retired in good order.<lb n="51878"/> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―With guns and cattle, added Stephen, pointing to the title- <lb n="51879"/>
              page of Cranly's book on which was printed <emph>Diseases of the <lb n="51880"/>
              Ox</emph>.<lb n="51881"/></said> </p>
              <p> As they passed through a lane of the tables Stephen said: <lb n="51882"/>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Cranly, I want to speak to you.<lb n="51883"/></said> </p>
              <p> Cranly did not answer or turn. He laid his book on the <lb n="51884"/>
              counter and passed out, his wellshod feet sounding flatly on the <lb n="51885"/>
              floor. On the staircase he paused and gazing absently at Dixon <lb n="51886"/>
              repeated: <lb n="51887"/>
              <said who="???">―Pawn to king's bloody fourth.<lb n="51888"/> </said>
              <said who="???">―Put it that way if you like, Dixon said.<lb n="51889"/></said> </p>
              <p> He had a quiet toneless voice and urbane manners and on a <lb n="51890"/>
              finger of his plump clean hand he displayed at moments a <lb n="51891"/>
              signet ring.<lb n="51892"/> </p>
              <p> As they crossed the hall a man of dwarfish stature came <lb n="51893"/>
              towards them. Under the dome of his tiny hat his unshaven <lb n="51894"/>
              face began to smile with pleasure and he was heard to murmur. <lb n="51895"/>
              The eyes were melancholy as those of a monkey. <lb n="51896"/>
              <said who="???">―Good evening, captain, said Cranly, halting.<lb n="51897"/> </said>
              <said who="???">―Good evening, gentlemen, said the stubblegrown monkeyish <lb n="51898"/>
              face.<lb n="51899"/> </said>
              <said who="???">―Warm weather for March, said Cranly. They have the win- <lb n="51900"/>
              dows open upstairs.<lb n="51901"/></said> </p>
              <p> Dixon smiled and turned his ring. The blackish monkey- <lb n="51902"/>
              puckered face pursed its human mouth with gentle pleasure <lb n="51903"/>
              and its voice purred: <lb n="51904"/>
              <said who="???">―Delightful weather for March. Simply delightful.<lb n="51905"/> </said>
              <said who="???">―There are two nice young ladies upstairs, captain, tired of <lb n="51906"/>
              waiting, Dixon said.<lb n="51907"/></said> </p>
              <p> Cranly smiled and said kindly: <lb n="51908"/>
              <said who="???">―The captain has only one love: sir Walter Scott. Isn't that so, <lb n="51909"/>
              captain?<lb n="51910"/> </said>
              <said who="???">―What are you reading now, captain? Dixon asked. <emph>The Bride <lb n="51911"/>

              <said who="???">―I love old Scott, the flexible lips said. I think he writes some- <lb n="51913"/>
              thing lovely. There is no writer can touch sir Walter Scott.<lb n="51914"/></said> </p>
              <p> He moved a thin shrunken brown hand gently in the air in <lb n="51915"/>
              time to his praise and his thin quick eyelids beat often over his <lb n="51916"/>
              sad eyes.<lb n="51917"/> </p>
              <p> Sadder to Stephen's ear was his speech: a genteel accent, low <lb n="51918"/>
              and moist, marred by errors: and listening to it he wondered <lb n="51919"/>
              was the story true and was the thin blood that flowed in his <lb n="51920"/>
              shrunken frame noble and come of an incestuous  love?<lb n="51921"/> </p>
              <p> The park trees were heavy with rain and rain fell still and <lb n="51922"/>
              ever in the lake, lying grey like a shield. A game of swans flew <lb n="51923"/>
              there and the water and the shore beneath were fouled with <lb n="51924"/>
              their greenwhite slime. They embraced softly impelled by the <lb n="51925"/>
              grey rainy light, the wet silent trees, the shieldlike witnessing <lb n="51926"/>
              lake, the swans. They embraced without joy or passion, his <lb n="51927"/>
              arm about his sister's neck. A grey woollen cloak was wrapped <lb n="51928"/>
              athwart her from her shoulder to her waist: and her fair head was <lb n="51929"/>
              bent in willing shame. He had loose redbrown hair and tender <lb n="51930"/>
              shapely strong freckled hands. Face? There was no face seen. <lb n="51931"/>
              The brother's face was bent upon her fair rainfragrant hair. <lb n="51932"/>
              The hand freckled and strong and shapely and caressing was <lb n="51933"/>
              Davin's hand.<lb n="51934"/> </p>
              <p> He frowned angrily upon his thought and on the shrivelled <lb n="51935"/>
              mannikin who had called it forth. His father's gibes at the <place><location><geo>51.680080 -9.452576</geo></location> <lb n="51936"/>
              <placeName>Bantry</placeName></place> gang leaped out of his memory. He held them at a <lb n="51937"/>
              distance and brooded uneasily on his own thought again. Why <lb n="51938"/>
                were they not  <name type="person">Cranly's</name> hands? Had <name type="person">Davin's</name> simplicity and in- <lb n="51939"/>

              <p> He walked on across the hall with <name type="person">Dixon</name>, leaving <name type="person">Cranly</name> to <lb n="51941"/>
              take leave elaborately of the dwarf.<lb n="51942"/> </p>
          <p> Under the colonnade <name type="person">Temple</name> was standing in the midst of a <lb n="51943"/>
              little group of students. One of them cried: <lb n="51944"/>
            <said who="???">―<name type="person">Dixon</name>, come over till you hear. <name type="person">Temple</name> is in grand form.<lb n="51945"/></said> </p>
          <p> <name type="person">Temple</name> turned on him his dark gipsy eyes. <lb n="51946"/>
            <said who="???">―You're a hypocrite, <name type="person">O'Keeffe</name>, he said. And <name type="person">Dixon's</name> a smiler. <lb n="51947"/>
              By hell, I think that's a good literary expression.<lb n="51948"/></said> </p>
          <p> He laughed slily, looking in <name type="person">Stephen's</name> face, repeating: <lb n="51949"/>
              <said who="???">―By hell, I'm delighted with that name. A smiler.<lb n="51950"/></said> </p>
              <p> A stout student who stood below them on the steps said: <lb n="51951"/>
                <said who="???">―Come back to the mistress, <name type="person">Temple</name>. We want to hear about <lb n="51952"/>
              that.<lb n="51953"/> </said>
                <said who="???">―He had, faith, <name type="person">Temple</name> said. And he was a married man too. <lb n="51954"/>
              And all the priests used to be dining there. By hell, I think they <lb n="51955"/>
              all had a touch.<lb n="51956"/> </said>
              <said who="???">―We shall call it riding a hack to spare the hunter, said <name type="person">Dixon</name>.<lb n="51957"/> </said>
                <said who="???">―Tell us, <name type="person">Temple</name>, <name type="person">O'Keeffe</name> said. How many quarts of porter <lb n="51958"/>
              have you in you?<lb n="51959"/> </said>
              <said who="???">―All your intellectual soul is in that phrase, <name type="person">O'Keeffe</name>, said <lb n="51960"/>
                <name type="person">Temple</name> with open scorn.<lb n="51961"/></said> </p>
              <p> He moved with a shambling gait round the group and spoke <lb n="51962"/>
                to <name type="person">Stephen</name>. <lb n="51963"/>
                <said who="???">―Did you know that the <name type="person">Forsters</name> are the kings of Belgium? he <lb n="51964"/>
              asked.<lb n="51965"/></said> </p>
          <p> <name type="person">Cranly</name> came out through the door of the entrance hall, his <lb n="51966"/>
              hat thrust back on the nape of his neck and picking his teeth <lb n="51967"/>
              with care. <lb n="51968"/>
            <said who="???">―And here's the wiseacre, said <name type="person">Temple</name>. Do you know that <lb n="51969"/>
              about the Forsters?<lb n="51970"/></said> </p>
          <p> He paused for an answer. <name type="person">Cranly</name> dislodged a figseed from <lb n="51971"/>
              his teeth on the point of his rude toothpick and gazed at it <lb n="51972"/>
              intently. <lb n="51973"/>
            <said who="???">―The Forster  family, <name type="person">Temple</name> said, is descended from <name type="person">Baldwin</name> <lb n="51974"/>
              the First, king of Flanders. He was called the Forester. Forester <lb n="51975"/>
              and Forster are the same name. A descendant of <name type="person">Baldwin</name> the <lb n="51976"/>
              First, <name type="person">captain Francis Forster</name>, settled in Ireland and married <lb n="51977"/>
              the daughter of the last chieftain of Clanbrassil. Then there are <lb n="51978"/>
              the Blake Forsters. That's a different branch.<lb n="51979"/> </said>
            <said who="???">―From Baldhead, king of Flanders, <name type="person">Cranly</name> repeated, rooting <lb n="51980"/>
              again deliberately at his gleaming uncovered teeth.<lb n="51981"/> </said>
              <said who="???">―Where did you pick up all that history? <name type="person">O'Keeffe</name> asked.<lb n="51982"/> </said>
              <said who="???">―I know all the history of your family too, <name type="person">Temple</name> said, <lb n="51983"/>
                turning to <name type="person">Stephen</name>. Do you know what <name type="person">Giraldus Cambrensis</name> <lb n="51984"/>
              says about your family?<lb n="51985"/> </said>
            <said who="???">―Is he descended from <name type="person">Baldwin</name> too? asked a tall consumptive <lb n="51986"/>
              student with dark eyes.<lb n="51987"/> </said>
            <said who="???">―Baldhead, <name type="person">Cranly</name> repeated, sucking at a crevice in his teeth.<lb n="51988"/> </said>
              <said who="???">―<seg xml:lang="la">Pernobilis et pervetusta familia</seg>, <name type="person">Temple</name> said to <name type="person">Stephen</name>.<lb n="51989"/></said> </p>
              <p> The stout student who stood below them on the steps farted <lb n="51990"/>
                briefly. <name type="person">Dixon</name> turned towards him saying in a soft voice: <lb n="51991"/>
              <said who="???">―Did an angel speak?<lb n="51992"/></said> </p>
              <p> Cranly turned also and said vehemently but without anger: <lb n="51993"/>
              <said who="???">―Goggins, you're the flamingest dirty devil I ever met, do you <lb n="51994"/>
              know.<lb n="51995"/> </said>
              <said who="???">―I had it on my mind to say that, Goggins answered firmly. It <lb n="51996"/>
              did no-one any harm, did it?<lb n="51997"/> </said>
              <said who="???">―We hope, Dixon said suavely, that it was not of the kind <lb n="51998"/>
              known to science as a <seg xml:lang="la">paulo post futurum</seg>.<lb n="51999"/> </said>
              <said who="???">―Didn't I tell you he was a smiler? said Temple, turning right <lb n="52000"/>
              and left. Didn't I give him that name?<lb n="52001"/> </said>
              <said who="???">―You did. We're not deaf, said the tall consumptive.<lb n="52002"/></said> </p>
              <p> Cranly still frowned at the stout student below him. Then, <lb n="52003"/>
              with a snort of disgust, he shoved him violently down the steps. <lb n="52004"/>
              <said who="???">―Go away from here, he said rudely. Go away, you stinkpot. <lb n="52005"/>
              And you are a stinkpot.<lb n="52006"/></said> </p>
              <p> Goggins skipped down on to the gravel and at once returned <lb n="52007"/>
              to his place with good humour. Temple turned back to Stephen <lb n="52008"/>
              and asked: <lb n="52009"/>
              <said who="???">―Do you believe in the law of heredity?<lb n="52010"/> </said>
              <said who="???">―Are you drunk or what are you or what are you trying to <lb n="52011"/>
              say? asked Cranly, facing round on him with an expression of <lb n="52012"/>
              wonder.<lb n="52013"/> </said>
              <said who="???">―The most profound sentence ever written, Temple said with <lb n="52014"/>
              enthusiasm, is the sentence at the end of the zoology. Repro- <lb n="52015"/>
              duction is the beginning of death.<lb n="52016"/></said> </p>
              <p> He touched Stephen timidly at the elbow and said eagerly: <lb n="52017"/>
              <said who="???">―Do you feel how profound that is because you are a poet?<lb n="52018"/></said> </p>
              <p> Cranly pointed his long forefinger. <lb n="52019"/>
              <said who="???">―Look at him! he said with scorn to the others. Look at <lb n="52020"/>
              Ireland's hope!<lb n="52021"/></said> </p>
              <p> They laughed at his words and gesture. Temple turned on <lb n="52022"/>
              him bravely, saying: <lb n="52023"/>
              <said who="???">―Cranly, you're always sneering at me. I can see that. But I <lb n="52024"/>
              am as good as you are any day. Do you know what I think <lb n="52025"/>
              about you now as compared with myself?<lb n="52026"/> </said>
              <said who="???">―My dear man, said Cranly urbanely, you are incapable, do <lb n="52027"/>
              you know, absolutely incapable of thinking.<lb n="52028"/> </said>
              <said who="???">―But do you know, Temple went on, what I think of you and <lb n="52029"/>
              of myself compared together?<lb n="52030"/> </said>
              <said who="???">―Out with it, Temple! the stout student cried from the steps. <lb n="52031"/>
              Get it out in bits!<lb n="52032"/></said> </p>
              <p> Temple turned right and left, making sudden feeble gestures <lb n="52033"/>
              as he spoke. <lb n="52034"/>
              <said who="???">―I'm a ballocks, he said, shaking his head in despair. I am. <lb n="52035"/>
              And I know I am. And I admit it that I am.<lb n="52036"/></said> </p>
              <p> Dixon patted him lightly on the shoulder and said mildly: <lb n="52037"/>
              <said who="???">―And it does you every credit, Temple.<lb n="52038"/> </said>
              <said who="???">―But he, Temple said, pointing to Cranly. He is a ballocks too <lb n="52039"/>
              like me. Only he doesn't know it. And that's the only difference <lb n="52040"/>
              I see.<lb n="52041"/></said> </p>
              <p> A burst of laughter covered his words. But he turned again <lb n="52042"/>
              to Stephen and said with a sudden eagerness: <lb n="52043"/>
              <said who="???">―That word is a most interesting word. That's the only Eng- <lb n="52044"/>
              lish dual number. Did you know?<lb n="52045"/> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Is it? Stephen said vaguely.<lb n="52046"/></said> </p>
              <p> He was watching Cranly's firmfeatured suffering face, lit up <lb n="52047"/>
              now by a smile of false patience. The gross name had passed <lb n="52048"/>
              over it like foul water poured over an old stone image, patient <lb n="52049"/>
              of injuries: and, as he watched him, he saw him raise his hat in <lb n="52050"/>
              salute and uncover the black hair that stood up stiffly from his <lb n="52051"/>
              forehead like an iron crown.<lb n="52052"/> </p>
              <p> She passed out from the porch of the library and bowed <lb n="52053"/>
              across Stephen in reply to Cranly's greeting. He also? Was there <lb n="52054"/>
              not a slight flush on Cranly's cheek? Or had it come forth at <lb n="52055"/>
              Temple's words? The light had waned. He could not see.<lb n="52056"/> </p>
              <p> Did that explain his friend's listless silence, his harsh com- <lb n="52057"/>
              ments, the sudden intrusions of rude speech with which he had <lb n="52058"/>
              shattered so often Stephen's ardent wayward confessions? Ste- <lb n="52059"/>
              phen had forgiven freely for he had found this rudeness also in <lb n="52060"/>
              himself towards himself. And he remembered an evening when <lb n="52061"/>
              he had dismounted from a borrowed creaking bicycle to pray <lb n="52062"/>
              to God in a wood near <place><location><geo>53.450924 -6.150138</geo></location><placeName>Malahide</placeName></place>. He had lifted up his arms <lb n="52063"/>
              and spoken in ecstasy to the sombre nave of the trees, knowing <lb n="52064"/>
              that he stood on holy ground and in a holy hour. And when <lb n="52065"/>
              two constabularymen had come into sight round a bend in the <lb n="52066"/>
              gloomy road he had broken off his prayer to whistle loudly an <lb n="52067"/>
              air from the last pantomime.<lb n="52068"/> </p>
              <p> He began to beat the frayed end of his ashplant against the <lb n="52069"/>
              base of a pillar. Had Cranly not heard him? Yet he could wait. <lb n="52070"/>
              The talk about him ceased for a moment: and a soft hiss fell <lb n="52071"/>
              again from a window above. But no other sound was in the air <lb n="52072"/>
              and the swallows whose flight he had followed with idle eyes <lb n="52073"/>
              were sleeping.<lb n="52074"/> </p>
              <p> She had passed through the dusk. And therefore the air was <lb n="52075"/>
              silent save for one soft hiss that fell. And therefore the tongues <lb n="52076"/>
              about him had ceased their babble. Darkness  was falling.<lb n="52077"/> </p>
              <p> <l><emph>Darkness falls from the air.</emph></l><lb n="52078"/> </p>
              <p> A trembling joy, lambent as a faint light, played like a fairy <lb n="52079"/>
              host around him. But why? Her passage through the darkening <lb n="52080"/>
              air or the verse with its black vowels and its opening sound, <lb n="52081"/>
              rich and lutelike?<lb n="52082"/> </p>
              <p> He walked away slowly towards the deeper shadows at the <lb n="52083"/>
              end of the colonnade, beating the stone softly with his stick to <lb n="52084"/>
              hide his revery from the students whom he had left: and <lb n="52085"/>
              allowed his mind to summon back to itself the age of Dowland <lb n="52086"/>
              and Byrd and Nash.<lb n="52087"/> </p>
              <p> Eyes, opening from the darkness of desire, eyes that dimmed <lb n="52088"/>
              the breaking east. What was their languid grace but the soft- <lb n="52089"/>
              ness of chambering? And what was their shimmer but the <lb n="52090"/>
              shimmer of the scum that mantled the cesspool of the court of a <lb n="52091"/>
              slobbering Stuart. And he tasted in the language of memory <lb n="52092"/>
              ambered wines, dying fallings of sweet airs, the proud pavan: <lb n="52093"/>
              and saw with the eyes of memory kind gentlewomen in <place><location><geo>51.511732 -0.123270</geo></location><placeName>Covent <lb n="52094"/>
              Garden</placeName></place> wooing from their balconies with sucking mouths and <lb n="52095"/>
              the poxfouled wenches of the taverns and young wives that, <lb n="52096"/>
              gaily yielding to their ravishers, clipped and clipped again.<lb n="52097"/> </p>
              <p> The images he had summoned gave him no pleasure. They <lb n="52098"/>
              were secret and enflaming but her image was not entangled by <lb n="52099"/>
              them. That was not the way to think of her. It was not even the <lb n="52100"/>
              way in which he thought of her. Could his mind then not trust <lb n="52101"/>
              itself? Old phrases, sweet only with a disinterred sweetness like <lb n="52102"/>
              the figseeds Cranly rooted out of his gleaming teeth.<lb n="52103"/> </p>
              <p> It was not thought nor vision though he knew vaguely that <lb n="52104"/>
              her figure was passing homeward through the city. Vaguely <lb n="52105"/>
              first and then more sharply he smelt her body. A conscious <lb n="52106"/>
              unrest seethed in his blood. Yes, it was her body that he smelt: <lb n="52107"/>
              a wild and languid smell: the tepid limbs over which his music <lb n="52108"/>
              had flowed desirously and the secret soft linen upon which her <lb n="52109"/>
              flesh distilled odour and a dew.<lb n="52110"/> </p>
              <p> A louse crawled over the nape of his neck and, putting his <lb n="52111"/>
              thumb and forefinger deftly beneath his loose collar, he caught <lb n="52112"/>
              it. He rolled its body, tender yet brittle as a grain of rice, be- <lb n="52113"/>
              tween thumb and finger for an instant before he let it fall from <lb n="52114"/>
              him and wondered would it live or die. There came to his mind <lb n="52115"/>
              a curious phrase from Cornelius a Lapide which said that the <lb n="52116"/>
              lice born of human sweat were not created by God with the <lb n="52117"/>
              other animals on the sixth day. But the tickling of the skin of <lb n="52118"/>
              his neck made his mind raw and red. The life of his body, <lb n="52119"/>
              illclad, illfed, louseeaten, made him close his eyelids in a sud- <lb n="52120"/>
              den spasm of despair: and in the darkness he saw the brittle <lb n="52121"/>
              bright bodies of lice falling from the air and turning often as <lb n="52122"/>
              they fell. Yes: and it was not darkness that fell from the air. It <lb n="52123"/>
              was brightness.<lb n="52124"/> </p>
              <p> <l><emph>Brightness falls from the air.</emph></l> <lb n="52125"/>
              <p> He had not even remembered rightly Nash's line. All the <lb n="52126"/>
              images it  had awakened were false. His mind bred vermin. His <lb n="52127"/>
              thoughts were lice born of the sweat of sloth.<lb n="52128"/> </p>
              <p> He came back quickly along the colonnade towards the <lb n="52129"/>
              group of students. Well then let her go and be damned to her. <lb n="52130"/>
              She could love some clean athlete who washed himself every <lb n="52131"/>
              morning to the waist and had black hair on his chest. Let her.<lb n="52132"/> </p>
              <p> Cranly had taken another dried fig from the supply in his <lb n="52133"/>
              pocket and was eating it slowly and noisily. Temple sat on the <lb n="52134"/>
              pediment of a pillar, leaning back, his cap pulled down on his <lb n="52135"/>
              sleepy eyes. A squat young man came out of the porch, a <lb n="52136"/>
              leather portfolio tucked under his armpit. He marched towards <lb n="52137"/>
              the group, striking the flags with the heels of his boots and <lb n="52138"/>
              with the ferrule of his heavy umbrella. Then, raising the um- <lb n="52139"/>
              brella in salute, he said to all: <lb n="52140"/>
              <said who="???">―Good evening, sirs.<lb n="52141"/></said> </p>
              <p> He struck the flags again and tittered while his head <lb n="52142"/>
              trembled with a slight nervous movement. The tall consump- <lb n="52143"/>
              tive student and Dixon and O'Keeffe were speaking in Irish and <lb n="52144"/>
              did not answer him. Then, turning to Cranly, he said: <lb n="52145"/>
              <said who="???">―Good evening, particularly to you.<lb n="52146"/></said> </p>
              <p> He moved the umbrella in indication and tittered again. <lb n="52147"/>
              Cranly, who was still chewing the fig, answered with loud <lb n="52148"/>
              movements of his jaws. <lb n="52149"/>
              <said who="???">―Good? Yes. It is a good evening.<lb n="52150"/></said> </p>
              <p> The squat student looked at him seriously and shook his <lb n="52151"/>
              umbrella gently and reprovingly. <lb n="52152"/>
              <said who="???">―I can see, he said, that you are about to make obvious <lb n="52153"/>
              remarks.<lb n="52154"/> </said>
              <said who="???">―Um, Cranly answered, holding out what remained of the <lb n="52155"/>
              halfchewed fig and jerking it towards the squat student's <lb n="52156"/>
              mouth in sign that he should eat.<lb n="52157"/></said> </p>
              <p> The squat student did not eat it but, indulging his  special <lb n="52158"/>
              humour, said gravely, still tittering and prodding his phrase <lb n="52159"/>
              with his  umbrella: <lb n="52160"/>
              <said who="???">―Do you intend that ...<lb n="52161"/></said> </p>
              <p> He broke off, pointed bluntly to the munched pulp of the fig <lb n="52162"/>
              and said loudly: <lb n="52163"/>
              <said who="???">―I allude to that.<lb n="52164"/> </said>
              <said who="???">―Um, Cranly said as before.<lb n="52165"/> </said>
              <said who="???">―Do you intend that now, the squat student said, as <emph>ipso facto</emph> <lb n="52166"/>
              or, let us say, as so to speak?<lb n="52167"/></said> </p>
              <p> Dixon turned aside from his group, saying: <lb n="52168"/>
              <said who="???">―Goggins was waiting for you, Glynn. He has gone round to <lb n="52169"/>
              the Adelphi to look for you and Moynihan. What have you <lb n="52170"/>
              there? he asked, tapping the portfolio under Glynn's arm.<lb n="52171"/> </said>
              <p> <said who="???">―Examination papers, Glynn answered. I give them monthly <lb n="52172"/>
              examinations to see that they are profiting by my tuition.<lb n="52173"/></said> </p>
              <p> He also tapped the portfolio and coughed gently and smiled. <lb n="52174"/>
              <said who="???">―Tuition! said Cranly rudely. I suppose you mean the bare- <lb n="52175"/>
              footed children that are taught by a bloody ape like you. God <lb n="52176"/>
              help them!<lb n="52177"/></said> </p>
              <p> He bit off the rest of the fig and flung away the butt. <lb n="52178"/>
              <said who="???">―I suffer little children to come unto me, Glynn said amiably.<lb n="52179"/> </said>
              <said who="???">―A bloody ape, Cranly repeated with emphasis, and a blas- <lb n="52180"/>
              phemous bloody ape!<lb n="52181"/></said> </p>
              <p> Temple stood up and, pushing past Cranly, addressed <lb n="52182"/>
              Glynn: <lb n="52183"/>
              <said who="???">―That phrase you said now, he said, is from the new testa- <lb n="52184"/>
              ment about suffer the children to come to me.<lb n="52185"/> </said>
              <said who="???">―Go to sleep again, Temple, said O'Keeffe.<lb n="52186"/> </said>
              <said who="???">―Very well, then, Temple continued, still addressing Glynn, <lb n="52187"/>
              and if Jesus suffered the children to come why does the church <lb n="52188"/>
              send them all to hell if they die unbaptised? Why is that?<lb n="52189"/> </said>
              <said who="???">―Were you baptised yourself, Temple? the consumptive stu- <lb n="52190"/>
              dent asked.<lb n="52191"/> </said>
              <said who="???">―But why are they sent to hell if Jesus said they were all to <lb n="52192"/>
              come? Temple said, his eyes searching in Glynn's eyes.<lb n="52193"/></said> </p>
              <p> Glynn coughed and said gently, holding back with difficulty <lb n="52194"/>
              the nervous titter in his voice and moving his umbrella at every <lb n="52195"/>
              word: <lb n="52196"/>
              <said who="???">―And, as you remark, if it is thus I ask emphatically whence <lb n="52197"/>
              comes this thusness.<lb n="52198"/> </said>
              <said who="???">―Because the church is cruel like all old sinners, Temple said.<lb n="52199"/> </said>
              <said who="???">―Are you quite orthodox on that point, Temple? Dixon said <lb n="52200"/>
              suavely.<lb n="52201"/> </said>
              <said who="???">―Saint Augustine says that about unbaptised children going to <lb n="52202"/>
              hell, Temple answered, because he was a cruel old sinner too.<lb n="52203"/> </said>
              <said who="???">―I bow to you, Dixon said, but I had the impression that <lb n="52204"/>
              limbo existed for such cases.<lb n="52205"/> </said>
              <said who="???">―Don't argue with him, Dixon, Cranly said brutally. Don't <lb n="52206"/>
              talk to him or look at him. Lead him home with a sugan the <lb n="52207"/>
              way you'd lead a bleating goat.<lb n="52208"/> </said>
              <said who="???">―Limbo! Temple cried. That's a fine invention too. Like hell.<lb n="52209"/> </said>
              <said who="???">―But with the unpleasantness left out, Dixon said.<lb n="52210"/></said> </p>
              <p> He turned smiling to the others and said: <lb n="52211"/>
              <said who="???">―I think I am voicing the opinions of all present in saying so <lb n="52212"/>
              much.<lb n="52213"/> </said>
              <said who="???">―You are, Glynn said in a firm tone. On that point Ireland is <lb n="52214"/>
              united.<lb n="52215"/></said> </p>
              <p> He struck the ferrule of his umbrella on the stone floor of <lb n="52216"/>
              the colonnade. <lb n="52217"/>
              <said who="???">―Hell, Temple said. I can respect that invention of the grey <lb n="52218"/>
              spouse of Satan. Hell is Roman, like the walls of the Romans, <lb n="52219"/>
              strong and ugly. But what is limbo?<lb n="52220"/> </said>
              <said who="???">―Put him back into  the perambulator, Cranly, O'Keeffe called <lb n="52221"/>
              out.<lb n="52222"/></said> </p>
              Cranly made a swift step towards Temple, halted, stamping <lb n="52223"/>
              his foot and crying as if to a fowl: <lb n="52224"/>
              <said who="Cranly">―Hoosh!<lb n="52225"/></said> </p>
              Temple moved away nimbly. <lb n="52226"/>
              <said who="Temple">―Do you know what limbo is? he cried. Do you know what <lb n="52227"/>
              we call a notion like that in Roscommon?<lb n="52228"/> </said>
              <said who="Cranly">―Hoosh! Blast you! Cranly cried, clapping his hands.<lb n="52229"/> </said>
              <said who="Temple">―Neither my arse nor my elbow! Temple cried out scornfully. <lb n="52230"/>
              And that's what I call limbo.<lb n="52231"/> </said>
              <said who="Cranly">―Give us that stick here, Cranly said.<lb n="52232"/></said> </p>
              <p> He snatched the ashplant roughly from Stephen's hand and <lb n="52233"/>
              sprang down the steps: but Temple, hearing him move in pur- <lb n="52234"/>
              suit, fled through the dusk like a wild creature, nimble and <lb n="52235"/>
              fleetfooted. Cranly's heavy boots were heard loudly charging <lb n="52236"/>
              across the quadrangle and then returning heavily, foiled and <lb n="52237"/>
              spurning the gravel at each step.<lb n="52238"/> </p>
              <p> His step was angry and with an angry abrupt gesture he <lb n="52239"/>
              thrust the stick back into Stephen's hand. Stephen felt that his <lb n="52240"/>
              anger had another cause but, feigning patience, touched his <lb n="52241"/>
              arm slightly and said quietly: <lb n="52242"/>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Cranly, I told you I wanted to speak to you. Come away.<lb n="52243"/></said> </p>
              <p> Cranly looked at him for a few moments and asked: <lb n="52244"/>
              <said who="???">―Now?<lb n="52245"/> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Yes, now, Stephen said. We can't speak here. Come away.<lb n="52246"/></said> </p>
              <p> They crossed the quadrangle together without speaking. The <lb n="52247"/>
              birdcall from <emph>Siegfried</emph> whistled softly followed them from the <lb n="52248"/>
              steps of the porch. Cranly turned: and Dixon, who had <lb n="52249"/>
              whistled, called out: <lb n="52250"/>
              <said who="???">―Where are you fellows off to? What about that  game, <lb n="52251"/>
              Cranly?<lb n="52252"/></said> </p>
              <p> They parleyed in shouts across the still air about a game of <lb n="52253"/>
              billiards to be played in the <place><location><geo>53.350570 -6.254002</geo></location><placeName>Adelphi hotel</placeName></place>. Stephen walked on <lb n="52254"/>
              alone and out into the quiet of Kildare Street. Opposite <lb n="52255"/>
              Maple's hotel he stood to wait, patient again. The name of the <lb n="52256"/>
              hotel, a colourless polished wood, and its colourless quiet front <lb n="52257"/>
              stung him like a glance of polite disdain. He stared angrily back <lb n="52258"/>
              at the softly lit drawingroom of the hotel in which he imagined <lb n="52259"/>
              the sleek lives of the patricians of Ireland housed in calm. They <lb n="52260"/>
              thought of army commissions and land agents: peasants greeted <lb n="52261"/>
              them along the roads  in the country: they knew the names of <lb n="52262"/>
              certain French dishes and gave orders to jarvies in highpitched <lb n="52263"/>
              provincial voices which pierced through their skintight accents.<lb n="52264"/> </p>
              <p> How could he hit their conscience or how cast his shadow <lb n="52265"/>
              over the imagination of their daughters, before their squires <lb n="52266"/>
              begat upon them, that they might breed a race less ignoble than <lb n="52267"/>
              their own? And under the deepened dusk he felt the thoughts <lb n="52268"/>
              and desires of the race to which he belonged flitting like bats <lb n="52269"/>
              across the dark country lanes,  under trees by the edges of <lb n="52270"/>
              streams and near the poolmottled bogs. A woman had waited <lb n="52271"/>
              in the doorway as Davin had passed by at night and, offering <lb n="52272"/>
              him a cup of milk, had all but wooed him to her bed: for Davin <lb n="52273"/>
              had the mild eyes of one that could be secret. But him no <lb n="52274"/>
              woman's eyes had wooed.<lb n="52275"/> </p>
              <p> His arm was taken in a strong grip and Cranly's voice said: <lb n="52276"/>
              <said who="???">―Let us eke go.<lb n="52277"/></said> </p>
              <p> They walked southward in silence. Then Cranly said: <lb n="52278"/>
              <said who="???">―That blithering idiot Temple! I swear to Moses, do you <lb n="52279"/>
              know, that I'll be the death of that fellow one time.<lb n="52280"/></said> </p>
              <p> But his voice was no longer angry and Stephen wondered <lb n="52281"/>
              was he thinking of her greeting to him under the porch.<lb n="52282"/> </p>
              <p> They turned to the left and walked on as before. When they <lb n="52283"/>
              had gone on so for some time Stephen said: <lb n="52284"/>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Cranly, I had an unpleasant quarrel this evening.<lb n="52285"/> </said>
              <said who="???">―With your people? Cranly asked.<lb n="52286"/> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―With my mother.<lb n="52287"/> </said>
              <said who="???">―About religion?<lb n="52288"/> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Yes, Stephen answered.<lb n="52289"/></said> </p>
              <p> After a pause Cranly asked: <lb n="52290"/>
              <said who="???">―What age is your mother?<lb n="52291"/> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Not old, Stephen said. She wishes me to make my easter <lb n="52292"/>
              duty.<lb n="52293"/> </said>
              <said who="???">―And will you?<lb n="52294"/> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―I will not, Stephen said.<lb n="52295"/> </said>
              <said who="???">―Why not? Cranly said.<lb n="52296"/> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―I will not serve, answered Stephen.<lb n="52297"/> </said>
              <said who="???">―That remark was made before, Cranly said calmly.<lb n="52298"/> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―It is made behind now, said Stephen hotly.<lb n="52299"/></said> </p>
              <p> Cranly pressed Stephen's arm, saying: <lb n="52300"/>
              <said who="???">―Go easy, my dear man. You're an excitable bloody man, do <lb n="52301"/>
              you know.<lb n="52302"/></said> </p>
              <p> He laughed nervously as he spoke and, looking up into Ste- <lb n="52303"/>
              phen's face with moved and friendly eyes, said: <lb n="52304"/>
              <said who="???">―Do you know that you are an excitable man?<lb n="52305"/> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―I daresay I am, said Stephen, laughing also.<lb n="52306"/></said> </p>
              <p> Their minds, lately estranged, seemed suddenly to have been <lb n="52307"/>
              drawn closer, one to the other. <lb n="52308"/>
              <said who="???">―Do you believe in the eucharist? Cranly asked.<lb n="52309"/> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―I do not, Stephen said.<lb n="52310"/> </said>
              <said who="???">―Do you disbelieve then?<lb n="52311"/> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―I neither believe in it nor disbelieve in it, Stephen answered.<lb n="52312"/> </said>
              <said who="???">―Many persons have doubts, even religious persons, yet they <lb n="52313"/>
              overcome them or put them aside, Cranly said. Are your <lb n="52314"/>
              doubts on that point too strong?<lb n="52315"/> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―I do not wish to overcome them, Stephen answered.<lb n="52316"/></said> </p>
              <p> Cranly, embarrassed for a moment, took another fig from <lb n="52317"/>
              his pocket and was about to eat it when Stephen said: <lb n="52318"/>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Don't, please. You cannot discuss this question with your <lb n="52319"/>
              mouth full of chewed  fig.<lb n="52320"/></said> </p>
              <p> Cranly examined the fig by the light of a lamp under which <lb n="52321"/>
              he halted. Then he smelt it with both nostrils, bit a tiny piece, <lb n="52322"/>
              spat it out and threw the fig rudely into the gutter. Addressing <lb n="52323"/>
              it as it lay, he said: <lb n="52324"/>
              <said who="???">―Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire!<lb n="52325"/></said> </p>
              <p> Taking Stephen's arm he went on again and said: <lb n="52326"/>
              <said who="???">―Do you not fear that those words may be spoken to you on <lb n="52327"/>
              the day of judgment?<lb n="52328"/> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―What is offered me on the other hand? Stephen asked. An <lb n="52329"/>
              eternity of bliss in the company of the dean of studies?<lb n="52330"/> </said>
              <said who="???">―Remember, Cranly said, that he would be glorified.<lb n="52331"/> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Ay, Stephen said somewhat bitterly. Bright, agile, impassible <lb n="52332"/>
              and, above all, subtle.<lb n="52333"/> </said>
              <said who="???">―It is a curious thing, do you know, Cranly said dispassion- <lb n="52334"/>
              ately, how your mind is supersaturated with the religion in <lb n="52335"/>
              which you say you disbelieve. Did you believe in it when you <lb n="52336"/>
              were at school? I bet you did.<lb n="52337"/> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―I did, Stephen answered.<lb n="52338"/> </said>
              <said who="???">―And were you happier then? Cranly asked softly. Happier <lb n="52339"/>
              than you are now, for instance?<lb n="52340"/> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Often happy, Stephen said, and often unhappy. I was some- <lb n="52341"/>
              one else then.<lb n="52342"/> </said>
              <said who="???">―How someone else? What do you mean by that  statement?<lb n="52343"/> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―I mean, said Stephen, that I was not myself as I am now, as I <lb n="52344"/>
              had to become.<lb n="52345"/> </said>
              <said who="???">―Not as you are now, not as you had to become, Cranly <lb n="52346"/>
              repeated. Let me ask you a question. Do you love your mother?<lb n="52347"/></said> </p>
              <p> Stephen shook his head slowly. <lb n="52348"/>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―I don't know what your words mean, he said simply.<lb n="52349"/> </said>
              <said who="???">―Have you never loved anyone? Cranly asked.<lb n="52350"/> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Do you mean women?<lb n="52351"/> </said>
              <said who="???">―I am not speaking of that, Cranly said in a colder tone. I ask <lb n="52352"/>
              you if you ever felt love towards anyone or anything.<lb n="52353"/></said> </p>
              <p> Stephen walked on beside his friend, staring gloomily at the <lb n="52354"/>
              footpath. <lb n="52355"/>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―I tried to love God, he said at length. It seems now I failed. It <lb n="52356"/>
              is very difficult. I tried to unite my will with the will of God <lb n="52357"/>
              instant by instant. In that I did not always fail. I could perhaps <lb n="52358"/>
              do that still .....<lb n="52359"/></said> </p>
              <p> Cranly cut him short by asking: <lb n="52360"/>
              <said who="???">―Has your mother had a happy life?<lb n="52361"/> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―How do I know? Stephen said.<lb n="52362"/> </said>
              <said who="???">―How many children had she?<lb n="52363"/> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Nine or ten, Stephen answered. Some died.<lb n="52364"/> </said>
              <said who="???">―Was your father .... Cranly interrupted himself for an in- <lb n="52365"/>
              stant: and then said: I don't want to pry  into your family <lb n="52366"/>
              affairs. But was your father what is called  well-to-do? I mean <lb n="52367"/>
              when you were growing up?<lb n="52368"/> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Yes, Stephen said.<lb n="52369"/> </said>
              <said who="???">―What was he? Cranly asked after a pause.<lb n="52370"/></said> </p>
              <p> Stephen began to enumerate glibly his father's attributes. <lb n="52371"/>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―A medical student, an oarsman, a tenor, an amateur actor, a <lb n="52372"/>
              shouting politician, a small landlord, a small investor, a <lb n="52373"/>
              drinker, a good fellow, a storyteller, somebody's secretary, <lb n="52374"/>
              something in a distillery, a taxgatherer, a bankrupt and at <lb n="52375"/>
              present a praiser of his own past.<lb n="52376"/></said> </p>
              <p> Cranly laughed, tightening  his grip on Stephen's arm, and <lb n="52377"/>
              said: <lb n="52378"/>
              <said who="???">―The distillery is damn good.<lb n="52379"/> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Is there anything else you want to know? Stephen asked.<lb n="52380"/> </said>
              <said who="???">―Are you in good circumstances at present?<lb n="52381"/> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Do I look it? Stephen asked bluntly.<lb n="52382"/> </said>
              <said who="???">―So then, Cranly went on musingly, you were born in the lap <lb n="52383"/>
              of luxury.<lb n="52384"/></said> </p>
              <p> He used the phrase broadly and loudly as he often used <lb n="52385"/>
              technical expressions as if he wished his hearer to understand <lb n="52386"/>
              that they were used by him without conviction. <lb n="52387"/>
              <said who="???">―Your mother must have gone through a good deal of suffer- <lb n="52388"/>
              ing, he said then. Would you not try to save her from suffering <lb n="52389"/>
              more even if .... or would you?<lb n="52390"/> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―If I could, Stephen said. That would cost me very little.<lb n="52391"/> </said>
              <said who="???">―Then do so, Cranly said. Do as she wishes you to do. What <lb n="52392"/>
              is it for you? You disbelieve in it. It is a form: nothing else. And <lb n="52393"/>
              you will set her mind at rest.<lb n="52394"/></said> </p>
              <p> He ceased and, as Stephen did not reply, remained silent. <lb n="52395"/>
              Then, as if giving utterance to the process of his own thought, <lb n="52396"/>
              he said: <lb n="52397"/>
              <said who="???">―Whatever else is unsure in this stinking dunghill of a world a <lb n="52398"/>
              mother's love is not. Your mother brings you into the world, <lb n="52399"/>
              carries you first in her body. What do we know about what she <lb n="52400"/>
              feels? But whatever she feels, it, at least, must be real. It must <lb n="52401"/>
              be. What are our ideas or ambitions? Play. Ideas! Why, that <lb n="52402"/>
              bloody bleating goat Temple has ideas. MacCann has ideas too. <lb n="52403"/>
              Every jackass going the  roads thinks he has ideas.<lb n="52404"/></said> </p>
              <p> Stephen, who had been listening to the unspoken speech <lb n="52405"/>
              behind the words, said with  assumed carelessness: <lb n="52406"/>
              <p> <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Pascal, if I remember rightly, would not suffer his mother to <lb n="52407"/>
              kiss him as he feared the contact of her sex.<lb n="52408"/> </said>
              <said who="???">―Pascal was a pig, said Cranly.<lb n="52409"/> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Aloysius Gonzaga, I think, was of the same mind, Stephen <lb n="52410"/>
              said.<lb n="52411"/> </said>
              <said who="???">―And he was another pig then, said Cranly.<lb n="52412"/> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―The church calls him a saint, Stephen objected.<lb n="52413"/> </said>
              <said who="???">―I don't care a flaming damn what anyone calls him, Cranly <lb n="52414"/>
              said rudely and flatly. I call him a pig.<lb n="52415"/></said> </p>
              <p> Stephen, preparing the words neatly in his mind, continued: <lb n="52416"/>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Jesus too seems to have treated his mother with scant cour- <lb n="52417"/>
              tesy in public but Suarez, a jesuit theologian and Spanish <lb n="52418"/>
              gentleman, has apologised for him.<lb n="52419"/> </said>
              <said who="???">―Did the idea ever occur to you, Cranly asked, that Jesus was <lb n="52420"/>
              not what he pretended to be?<lb n="52421"/> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―The first person to whom that idea occurred,  Stephen <lb n="52422"/>
              answered, was Jesus himself.<lb n="52423"/> </said>
              <said who="???">―I mean, Cranly said,  hardening in his speech, did the idea <lb n="52424"/>
              ever occur to you that he was himself a conscious hypocrite, <lb n="52425"/>
              what he called the jews of his time, a whited sepulchre? Or, to <lb n="52426"/>
              put it more plainly, that he was a blackguard?<lb n="52427"/> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―That idea never occurred  to me, Stephen answered. But I am <lb n="52428"/>
              curious to know are you trying to make a convert of me or a <lb n="52429"/>
              pervert of yourself?<lb n="52430"/></said> </p>
              <p> He turned towards his friend's face and saw there a raw <lb n="52431"/>
              smile which some force of will strove to make finely significant.<lb n="52432"/> </p>
              <p> Cranly asked suddenly in a plain sensible tone: <lb n="52433"/>
              <said who="???">―Tell me the truth. Were you at all shocked by what I said?<lb n="52434"/> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Somewhat, Stephen said.<lb n="52435"/> </said>
              <said who="???">―And why were you shocked, Cranly pressed on in the same <lb n="52436"/>
              tone, if you feel sure that our religion is false and that Jesus <lb n="52437"/>
              was not the son of God?<lb n="52438"/> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―I am not at all sure of it, Stephen said. He is more like a son <lb n="52439"/>
              of God than a son of Mary.<lb n="52440"/> </said>
              <said who="???">―And is that why you will not communicate, Cranly asked, <lb n="52441"/>
              because you are not sure of that too, because you feel that the <lb n="52442"/>
              host too may be the body and blood of the son of God and not <lb n="52443"/>
              a wafer of bread? And because you fear that it may be?<lb n="52444"/> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Yes, Stephen said quietly. I feel that and I also fear it.<lb n="52445"/> </said>
              <said who="???">―I see, Cranly said.<lb n="52446"/></said> </p>
              <p> Stephen, struck by his tone of closure, reopened the dis- <lb n="52447"/>
              cussion at once by saying: <lb n="52448"/>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―I fear many things: dogs, horses, firearms, the sea, thunder- <lb n="52449"/>
              storms, machinery, the country roads at night.<lb n="52450"/> </said>
              <said who="???">―But why do you fear a bit of bread?<lb n="52451"/> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―I imagine, Stephen said, that there is a malevolent  reality <lb n="52452"/>
              behind those things I say I fear.<lb n="52453"/> </said>
              <said who="???">―Do you fear then, Cranly asked, that the God of the Roman <lb n="52454"/>
              catholics would strike you dead and damn you if you made a <lb n="52455"/>
              sacrilegious communion?<lb n="52456"/> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―The God of the Roman catholics could do that now, Stephen <lb n="52457"/>
              said. I fear more than that the chemical action which would be <lb n="52458"/>
              set up in my soul by a false homage to a symbol behind which <lb n="52459"/>
              are massed twenty centuries of authority and veneration.<lb n="52460"/> </said>
              <said who="???">―Would you, Cranly asked, in extreme danger commit that <lb n="52461"/>
              particular sacrilege? For instance, if you lived in the penal days?<lb n="52462"/> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―I cannot answer for the past, Stephen replied. Possibly not.<lb n="52463"/> </said>
              <said who="???">―Then, said Cranly, you do not intend to become a protes- <lb n="52464"/>
              tant?<lb n="52465"/> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―I said that I had lost the faith, Stephen answered, but not <lb n="52466"/>
              that I had lost selfrespect. What kind of liberation would that <lb n="52467"/>
              be to forsake an absurdity which is logical and coherent and to <lb n="52468"/>
              embrace one which is illogical and incoherent?<lb n="52469"/></said> </p>
              <p> They had walked on towards the township of <place><location><geo>51.873620 -8.347738</geo></location><placeName>Pembroke</placeName></place> and <lb n="52470"/>
              now, as they went on slowly along the avenues, the trees and <lb n="52471"/>
              the scattered lights in the villas soothed their minds. The air of <lb n="52472"/>
              wealth and repose diffused about them seemed to comfort their <lb n="52473"/>
              neediness. Behind a hedge of laurel a light glimmered in the <lb n="52474"/>
              window of a kitchen and the voice of a servant was heard <lb n="52475"/>
              singing as she sharpened knives. She sang in short broken bars <lb n="52476"/>
              <emph>Rosie O'Grady</emph>.<lb n="52477"/> </p>
              <p> Cranly stopped to listen, saying: <lb n="52478"/>
              <said who="???">―<seg xml:lang="la">Mulier cantat.</seg><lb n="52479"/></said> </p>
              <p> The soft beauty of the Latin word touched with an enchant- <lb n="52480"/>
              ing touch the  dark of the evening, with a touch fainter and <lb n="52481"/>
              more persuading than the touch of music or of a woman's <lb n="52482"/>
              hand. The strife of their minds was quelled. The figure of <lb n="52483"/>
              woman as she appears in the liturgy of the church passed si- <lb n="52484"/>
              lently through the darkness: a whiterobed figure, small and <lb n="52485"/>
              slender as a boy and with a falling girdle. Her voice, frail and <lb n="52486"/>
              high as a boy's, was heard intoning from a distant choir the <lb n="52487"/>
              first words of a woman which pierce the gloom and clamour of <lb n="52488"/>
              the first chanting of the passion: <lb n="52489"/>
              <said who="???">―<seg xml:lang="la">Et tu cum Jesu Galilaeo eras.</seg><lb n="52490"/></said> </p>
              <p> And all  hearts were touched and turned to her voice, shining <lb n="52491"/>
              like a young star, shining clearer as the voice intoned the pro- <lb n="52492"/>
              paroxyton and more faintly as the cadence died.<lb n="52493"/> </p>
              <p> The singing ceased. They went on together, Cranly repeating <lb n="52494"/>
              in strongly stressed rhythm the end of the refrain: <lb n="52495"/>
              <lg>
                <l>And when we are married</l> <lb n="52496"/>
                <l>O, how happy we'll be</l> <lb n="52497"/>
                <l>For I love sweet Rosie O'Grady</l> <lb n="52498"/>
                <l>And Rosie O'Grady loves me.</l> <lb n="52499"/>
              </lg>
              <said who="???">―There's real poetry for you, he said. There's real love.<lb n="52500"/></said> </p>
              <p> He glanced sideways at Stephen with a strange smile and <lb n="52501"/>
              said: <lb n="52502"/>
              <said who="???">―Do you consider that poetry? Or do you know what the <lb n="52503"/>
              words mean?<lb n="52504"/> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―I want to see Rosie first, said Stephen.<lb n="52505"/> </said>
              <said who="???">―She's easy to find, Cranly said.<lb n="52506"/></said> </p>
              <p> His hat had come down on his forehead. He shoved it back: <lb n="52507"/>
              and in the shadow of the trees Stephen saw his pale face, <lb n="52508"/>
              framed by the dark, and his large dark eyes. Yes. His face was <lb n="52509"/>
              handsome: and his body was strong and hard. He had spoken <lb n="52510"/>
              of a mother's love. He felt then the sufferings of women, the <lb n="52511"/>
              weaknesses of their bodies and souls: and would shield them <lb n="52512"/>
              with a strong  and resolute arm and bow his mind to them.<lb n="52513"/> </p>
              <p> Away then: it is time to go. A voice spoke softly to Stephen's <lb n="52514"/>
              lonely heart, bidding him go and telling him that his friendship <lb n="52515"/>
              was coming to an end. Yes: he would go. He could not strive <lb n="52516"/>
              against another. He knew his part. <lb n="52517"/>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Probably I shall go away, he said.<lb n="52518"/> </said>
              <said who="???">―Where? Cranly asked.<lb n="52519"/> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Where I can, Stephen said.<lb n="52520"/> </said>
              <said who="???">―Yes, Cranly said. It might be difficult for you to live here <lb n="52521"/>
              now. But is it that that makes you go?<lb n="52522"/> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―I have to go, Stephen answered.<lb n="52523"/></said> </p>
              <said who="???">―Because, Cranly continued, you need not look upon yourself <lb n="52524"/>
              as driven away if you do not wish to go or as a heretic or an <lb n="52525"/>
              outlaw. There are many good believers who think as you do. <lb n="52526"/>
              Would that surprise you? The church is not the stone building <lb n="52527"/>
              nor even the clergy and their dogmas. It is the whole mass of <lb n="52528"/>
              those born into it. I don't know what you wish to do in life. Is <lb n="52529"/>
              it what you told me the night we were standing outside <place><location><geo>53.333446 -6.262433</geo></location><placeName>Har- <lb n="52530"/>

              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Yes, Stephen said, smiling in spite of himself at Cranly's way <lb n="52532"/>
              of remembering thoughts in connection with places. The night <lb n="52533"/>
              you spent half an hour wrangling with Doherty about the <lb n="52534"/>
              shortest way from <place><location><geo>53.136900 -6.310000</geo></location><placeName>Sallygap</placeName></place> to Larras.<lb n="52535"/> </said>
              <said who="???">―Pothead! Cranly said with calm contempt. What does he <lb n="52536"/>
              know about the way from Sallygap to Larras? Or what does he <lb n="52537"/>
              know about anything for that matter? And the big slobbering <lb n="52538"/>
              washingpot head of him!<lb n="52539"/></said> </p>
              <p> He broke out into a loud long laugh. <lb n="52540"/>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Well? Stephen said. Do you remember the rest?<lb n="52541"/> </said>
              <said who="???">―What you said, is it? Cranly asked. Yes, I remember it. To <lb n="52542"/>
              discover the mode of life or of art whereby your spirit could <lb n="52543"/>
              express itself in unfettered freedom.<lb n="52544"/></said> </p>
              <p> Stephen raised his hat in acknowledgment. <lb n="52545"/>
              <said who="???">―Freedom! Cranly repeated. But you are not free enough yet <lb n="52546"/>
              to commit a sacrilege. Tell me, would you rob?<lb n="52547"/> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―I would beg first, Stephen said.<lb n="52548"/> </said>
              <said who="???">―And if you got  nothing would you rob?<lb n="52549"/> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―You wish me to say, Stephen answered, that the rights of <lb n="52550"/>
              property are provisional and that in certain circumstances it is <lb n="52551"/>
              not unlawful to rob. Everyone would act in that belief. So I will <lb n="52552"/>
              not make you that answer. Apply to the jesuit theologian Juan <lb n="52553"/>
              Mariana de Talavera who will also explain to you in what <lb n="52554"/>
              circumstances you may lawfully kill your king and whether you <lb n="52555"/>
              had better hand him his poison in a goblet or smear it for him <lb n="52556"/>
              upon his robe or his saddlebow. Ask me rather would I suffer <lb n="52557"/>
              others to rob me or, if they did, would I call down upon them <lb n="52558"/>
              what I believe is called the chastisement of the secular arm.<lb n="52559"/> </said>
              <said who="???">―And would you?<lb n="52560"/> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―I think, Stephen said, it would pain me as much to do so as <lb n="52561"/>
              to be robbed.<lb n="52562"/> </said>
              <said who="???">―I see, Cranly said.<lb n="52563"/></said> </p>
              <p> He produced his match and began to clean the crevice be- <lb n="52564"/>
              tween two teeth. Then he said carelessly: <lb n="52565"/>
              <said who="???">―Tell me, for example, would you deflower a virgin?<lb n="52566"/> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Excuse me, Stephen said politely. Is that not the ambition of <lb n="52567"/>
              most young gentlemen?<lb n="52568"/> </said>
              <said who="???">―What then is your point of view? Cranly asked.<lb n="52569"/></said> </p>
              <p> His last phrase, soursmelling as the smoke of charcoal and <lb n="52570"/>
              disheartening, excited Stephen's brain over which its fumes <lb n="52571"/>
              seemed to brood. <lb n="52572"/>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Look here, Cranly, he said. You have asked me what I would <lb n="52573"/>
              do and what I would not do. I will tell you what I will do and <lb n="52574"/>
              what I will not do. I will not serve that in which I no longer <lb n="52575"/>
              believe whether it call itself my home, my fatherland or my <lb n="52576"/>
              church: and I will try to express myself in some mode of life or <lb n="52577"/>
              art as freely as I can and as wholly as I can, using for my <lb n="52578"/>
              defence the only arms I allow myself to use, - silence, exile and <lb n="52579"/>
              cunning.<lb n="52580"/></said> </p>
              <p> Cranly seized his arm and steered him round so as to lead <lb n="52581"/>
              him back towards <place><location><geo>53.328562 -6.251897</geo></location><placeName>Leeson Park</placeName></place>. He laughed almost slily and <lb n="52582"/>
              pressed Stephen's arm with an elder's affection. <lb n="52583"/>
              <said who="???">―Cunning indeed! he said. Is it you? You poor poet, you!<lb n="52584"/> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―And you made me confess to you, Stephen said, thrilled by <lb n="52585"/>
              his touch, as I have confessed to you so  many other things, <lb n="52586"/>
              have I not?<lb n="52587"/> </said>
              <said who="???">―Yes, my child, Cranly said, still gaily.<lb n="52588"/> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―You made me confess the fears that I have. But I will tell you <lb n="52589"/>
              also what I do not fear. I do not fear to be alone or to be <lb n="52590"/>
              spurned for another or to leave whatever I have to leave. And I <lb n="52591"/>
              am not afraid to make a mistake, even  a great  mistake, a <lb n="52592"/>
              lifelong mistake and perhaps as long as eternity too.<lb n="52593"/></said> </p>
              <p> Cranly, now grave again, slowed his pace and said: <lb n="52594"/>
              <said who="???">―Alone, quite alone. You have no fear of that. And you know <lb n="52595"/>
              what that word means? Not only to be separate from all others <lb n="52596"/>
              but to have not even one friend.<lb n="52597"/> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―I will take the risk, said Stephen.<lb n="52598"/> </said>
              <said who="???">―And not to have any one person, Cranly said, who would be <lb n="52599"/>
              more than a friend, more even than the noblest and truest <lb n="52600"/>
              friend a man ever had.<lb n="52601"/></said> </p>
              <p> His words seemed to have struck some deep chord in his <lb n="52602"/>
              own nature. Had he spoken of himself, of himself as he was or <lb n="52603"/>
              wished to be? Stephen watched his face for some moments in <lb n="52604"/>
              silence. A cold sadness was there. He had spoken of himself, of <lb n="52605"/>
              his own loneliness which he feared. <lb n="52606"/>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Of whom are you speaking? Stephen asked at length.<lb n="52607"/></said> </p>
              <p> Cranly did not answer.<lb n="52608"/> </p>

              volt. He had his grand manner on. I supple and suave. Attacked <lb n="52610"/>
              me on the score of love for one's mother. Tried to imagine his <lb n="52611"/>
              mother: cannot. Told me once, in a moment of thoughtlessness, <lb n="52612"/>
              his father was sixtyone when he was born. Can see him. Strong <lb n="52613"/>
              farmer type. Pepper and salt suit. Square feet. Unkempt <lb n="52614"/>
              grizzled beard. Probably attends coursing matches. Pays his <lb n="52615"/>
              dues regularly but not plentifully to Father Dwyer of Larras. <lb n="52616"/>
              Sometimes talks to girls after nightfall. But his mother? Very <lb n="52617"/>
              young or very old? Hardly the first. If so, Cranly would not <lb n="52618"/>
              have spoken as he did. Old then. Probably: and neglected. <lb n="52619"/>
              Hence Cranly's despair of soul: the child of exhausted loins.<lb n="52620"/> </p>
              <p> <emph>21 March, morning:</emph> Thought this in bed last night but was <lb n="52621"/>
              too lazy and free to add it. Free, yes. The exhausted loins are <lb n="52622"/>
              those of Elizabeth and Zachary. Then is he [is] the precursor. Item: <lb n="52623"/>
              he eats chiefly belly bacon and dried figs. Read locusts and wild <lb n="52624"/>
              honey. Also, when thinking of him, saw always a stern severed <lb n="52625"/>
              head or deathmask as if outlined on a grey curtain or veronica. <lb n="52626"/>
              Decollation they call it in the fold. Puzzled for the moment by <lb n="52627"/>
              saint John at the Latin gate. What do I see? A decollated <lb n="52628"/>
              precursor trying to pick the lock.<lb n="52629"/> </p>
              <p> <emph>21 March, night:</emph> Free. Soulfree and fancyfree. Let the dead <lb n="52630"/>

              <p> <emph>23 March:</emph> Have not seen her since that night. Unwell? Sits at <lb n="52635"/>
              the fire perhaps with mamma's shawl on her shoulders. But not <lb n="52636"/>
              peevish. A nice bowl of gruel? Won't you now?<lb n="52637"/> </p>
              <p> <emph>24 March:</emph> Began with a discussion with my mother. Subject: <lb n="52638"/>
              B. V. M. Handicapped by my sex and youth. To escape held up <lb n="52639"/>
              relations between Jesus and Papa against those between Mary <lb n="52640"/>
              and her son. Said religion is not a lying-in hospital. Mother <lb n="52641"/>
              indulgent. Said I have a queer mind and have read too much. <lb n="52642"/>
              Not true. Have read little and understood less. Then she said I <lb n="52643"/>
              would come back to faith because I had a restless mind. This <lb n="52644"/>
              means to leave church by backdoor of sin and reenter through <lb n="52645"/>
              the skylight of repentance. Cannot repent. Told her so and <lb n="52646"/>
              asked for sixpence. Got threepence.<lb n="52647"/> </p>
              <p> Then went to college. Other wrangle with little roundhead <lb n="52648"/>
              rogue's eye Ghezzi. This time about Bruno the Nolan. Began in <lb n="52649"/>
              Italian and ended in pidgin English. He said Bruno was a ter- <lb n="52650"/>
              rible heretic. I said he was terribly burned. He agreed to this <lb n="52651"/>
              with some sorrow. Then gave me recipe for what he calls <lb n="52652"/>
              <emph>risotto alla bergamasca</emph>. When he pronounces a soft <emph>o</emph> he pro- <lb n="52653"/>
              trudes his full carnal lips as if he kissed the vowel. Has he? And <lb n="52654"/>
              could he repent? Yes, he could: and cry two round rogue's <lb n="52655"/>

              ninetyseventh infantry regiment, sat at the foot of the cross and <lb n="52660"/>
              tossed up dice for the overcoat of the crucified.<lb n="52661"/> </p>
              <p> Went to library. Tried to read three reviews. Useless. She is <lb n="52662"/>

              <p> A long curving gallery. From the floor ascend pillars of dark <lb n="52674"/>
              vapours. It is peopled by the images of fabulous kings, set in <lb n="52675"/>
              stone. Their hands are folded upon their knees in token of <lb n="52676"/>
              weariness and their eyes are darkened for the errors of men go <lb n="52677"/>
              up before them for ever as dark vapours.<lb n="52678"/> </p>
              <p> Strange figures advance from a cave. They are not as tall as <lb n="52679"/>
              men. One does not seem to stand quite apart from another. <lb n="52680"/>
              Their faces are phosphorescent, with darker streaks. They peer <lb n="52681"/>
              at me and their eyes seem to ask me something. They do not <lb n="52682"/>
              speak.<lb n="52683"/> </p>
              <p> <emph>30 March:</emph> This evening Cranly was in the porch of the <lb n="52684"/>
              library, proposing a problem to Dixon and her brother. A <lb n="52685"/>
              mother let her child fall into the Nile. Still harping on the <lb n="52686"/>
              mother. A crocodile seized the child. Mother asked it back. <lb n="52687"/>
              Crocodile said all right if she told him what he was going to do <lb n="52688"/>
              with the child, eat it or not eat it.<lb n="52689"/> </p>
              <p> This mentality, Lepidus would say, is indeed bred out of <lb n="52690"/>

              bring his crocodile? Is he the shining light now? Well, I dis- <lb n="52697"/>

              church</placeName></place>. He was in a black sweater and had a hurleystick. <lb n="52701"/>
              Asked me was it true I was going away and why. Told him the <lb n="52702"/>
              shortest way to <place><location><geo>53.412910 -8.243890</geo></location><placeName>Tara</placeName></place> was <lb n="52703"/>

              came up. Introduction. Father polite and observant. Asked <lb n="52704"/>
              Davin if he might offer him some refreshment. Davin could <lb n="52705"/>
              not, was going to a meeting. When we came away father told <lb n="52706"/>
              me he had a good honest eye. Asked me why I did not join a <lb n="52707"/>
              rowing club. I pretended to think it over. Told me then how he <lb n="52708"/>
              broke Pennyfeather's heart. Wants me to read law. Says I was <lb n="52709"/>
              cut out for that. More mud, more crocodiles.<lb n="52710"/> </p>
              <p> <emph>5 April:</emph> Wild spring. Scudding clouds. O life! Dark stream of <lb n="52711"/>
              swirling bogwater on which appletrees have cast down their <lb n="52712"/>
              delicate flowers. Eyes of girls among the leaves. Girls demure <lb n="52713"/>
              and romping. All fair or auburn: no dark ones. They blush <lb n="52714"/>
              better. Houp-la!<lb n="52715"/> </p>
              <p> <emph>6 April:</emph> Certainly she remembers the past. Lynch says all <lb n="52716"/>
              women do. Then she remembers the time of her childhood – <lb n="52717"/>
              and mine if I was ever a child. The past is consumed in the <lb n="52718"/>
              present and the present is living only because it brings forth the <lb n="52719"/>
              future. Statues of women, if Lynch be right, should always be <lb n="52720"/>
              fully draped, one hand of the woman feeling regretfully her <lb n="52721"/>
              own hinder parts.<lb n="52722"/> </p>
              <p> <emph>6 April: later:</emph> Michael Robartes remembers forgotten beauty <lb n="52723"/>
              and, when his arms wrap her round, he presses in his arms the <lb n="52724"/>
              loveliness which has long faded from the world. Not this. Not <lb n="52725"/>
              at all. I desire to press in my arms the loveliness which has not <lb n="52726"/>
              yet come into the world.<lb n="52727"/> </p>
              <p> 10 April:<emph></emph> Faintly, under the heavy night, through  the silence <lb n="52728"/>
              of the city which has turned from dreams to dreamless sleep as <lb n="52729"/>
              a weary lover whom no caresses move, the sound of hoofs <lb n="52730"/>
              upon the road. Not so faintly now as they come near the <lb n="52731"/>
              bridge; and in a moment as they pass the darkened windows <lb n="52732"/>
              the silence is cloven by alarm as by an arrow. They are heard <lb n="52733"/>
              now far away, hoofs that shine amid the heavy  night as gems, <lb n="52734"/>
              hurrying beyond the sleeping fields to what journey's end – <lb n="52735"/>
              what heart? – bearing what tidings?<lb n="52736"/> </p>
              <p> <emph>11 April:</emph> Read what I wrote last night. Vague words for a <lb n="52737"/>
              vague emotion. Would she like it? I think so. Then I should <lb n="52738"/>
              have to like it also.<lb n="52739"/> </p>
              <p> <emph>13 April:</emph> That tundish has been on my mind for a long time. <lb n="52740"/>
              I looked it up and find it is English and good old blunt English <lb n="52741"/>
              too. Damn the dean of studies and his funnel! What did he <lb n="52742"/>
              come here for to teach us his own language or to learn it from <lb n="52743"/>
              us. Damn him one way or the other!<lb n="52744"/> </p>
              <p> <emph>14 April:</emph> John Alphonsus Mulrennan has just returned from <lb n="52745"/>
              the west of Ireland (European and Asiatic papers please copy). <lb n="52746"/>
              He told us he met an old man there in a mountain cabin. Old <lb n="52747"/>
              man had red eyes and short pipe. Old man spoke Irish. <lb n="52748"/>
              Mulrennan spoke Irish. Then old man and Mulrennan spoke <lb n="52749"/>
              English. Mulrennan spoke to him about universe and stars. Old <lb n="52750"/>
              man sat, listened, smoked, spat. Then said: <lb n="52751"/>
              <said who="???">―Ah, there must be terrible queer creatures at the latter end of <lb n="52752"/>
              the world.<lb n="52753"/></said> </p>
              <p> I fear him. I fear his redrimmed horny eyes. It is with him I <lb n="52754"/>
              must struggle all through this night till day come, till he or I lie <lb n="52755"/>
              dead, gripping him by the sinewy throat till .... Till what? Till <lb n="52756"/>
              he yield to me? No. I mean him no harm.<lb n="52757"/> </p>
              <p> <emph>15 April:</emph> Met her today pointblank in <place><location><geo>53.342556 -6.259573</geo></location><placeName>Grafton Street</placeName></place>. The <lb n="52758"/>
              crowd brought us together. We both stopped. She asked me <lb n="52759"/>
              why I never came, said she had heard all sorts of stories about <lb n="52760"/>
              me. This was only to gain time. Asked me was I writing poems. <lb n="52761"/>
              About whom? I asked her. This confused her more and I felt <lb n="52762"/>
              sorry and mean. Turned off that valve at once and opened the <lb n="52763"/>
              spiritual-heroic refrigerating apparatus, invented and patented <lb n="52764"/>
              in all countries by Dante Alighieri. Talked rapidly of myself <lb n="52765"/>
              and my plans. In the midst of it unluckily I made a sudden <lb n="52766"/>
              gesture of a revolutionary nature. I must have looked like a <lb n="52767"/>
              fellow throwing a handful of peas up into the air. People began <lb n="52768"/>
              to look at us.  She shook hands a moment after and, in going <lb n="52769"/>
              away, said she hoped I would do what I said.<lb n="52770"/> </p>
              <p> Now I call that friendly, don't you?<lb n="52771"/> </p>
              <p> Yes. I liked her today. A little or much? Don't know. I liked <lb n="52772"/>
              her – and it seems a new feeling to me. Then, in that case, all <lb n="52773"/>
              the rest, all that I thought I thought and all that I felt I felt, all <lb n="52774"/>
              the rest before now, in fact ...... O, give it up, old chap! Sleep it <lb n="52775"/>
              off!<lb n="52776"/> </p>
              <p> <emph>16 April:</emph> Away! Away!<lb n="52777"/> </p>
              <p> The spell of arms and voices: the white arms of roads, their <lb n="52778"/>
              promise of close embraces and the black arms of tall ships that <lb n="52779"/>
              stand against the moon, their tale of distant nations. They are <lb n="52780"/>
              held out to say: We are alone. Come. And the voices say with <lb n="52781"/>
              them: We are your kinsmen.  And  the air is thick with their <lb n="52782"/>
              company as they call to me, their kinsman, making ready to go, <lb n="52783"/>
              shaking the wings of their exultant and terrible youth.<lb n="52784"/> </p>
              <p> <emph>26 April:</emph> Mother is putting my new secondhand clothes in <lb n="52785"/>
              order. She prays now, she says, that I may learn in my own life <lb n="52786"/>
              and away from home and friends what the heart is and what it <lb n="52787"/>
              feels. Amen. So be it. Welcome, O life! I go to encounter for the <lb n="52788"/>
              millionth time the reality of experience and to forge in the <lb n="52789"/>
              smithy of my soul the uncreated conscience of my race.<lb n="52790"/> </p>
              <p> <emph>27 April:</emph> Old father, old artificer, stand me now and ever in <lb n="52791"/>
              good stead.<lb n="52792"/> </p>
