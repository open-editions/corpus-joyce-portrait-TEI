		<p>Once upon a time and a very good time it was there was
			a moocow coming down along the road and this moocow
			that was coming down along the road met a nicens little
			boy named baby tuckoo .... </p>
		<p>His father told him that story: his father looked at him
			through a glass: he had a hairy face. </p>
		<p>He was baby tuckoo. The moocow came down the road
			where Betty Byrne lived: she sold lemon platt. </p>

		<lg type="song">
			<l>O, the wild rose blossoms</l>
			<l>On the little green place.</l>
		</lg>

		<p>He sang that song. That was his song. </p>

		<lg type="song">
			<l>O, the green wothe botheth.</l>
		</lg>

		<p>When you wet the bed first it is warm then it gets cold. His
			mother put on the oilsheet. That had the queer smell. </p>
		<p>His mother had a nicer smell than his father. She played on
			the piano the sailor's hornpipe for him to dance. He danced: </p>

		<lg type="song">
			<l>Tralala lala</l>
			<l>Tralala tralaladdy</l>

		<p>Uncle Charles and Dante clapped. They were older than his very old
			father and mother but uncle Charles was older than Dante. </p>
		<p>Dante had two brushes in her press. The brush with the
			maroon velvet back was for Michael Davitt and the brush with
			the green velvet back was for Parnell. Dante gave him a cachou
			every time he brought her a piece of tissue paper. </p>
		<p>The Vances lived in number seven. They had a different
			father and mother. They were Eileen's father and mother.
			When they were grown up he was going to marry Eileen. He
			hid under the table. His mother said: </p>
		<p><said who="Mary Dedalus">—O, Stephen will apologise. </said></p>

		<p>The wide playgrounds were swarming with boys. All were
			shouting and the prefects urged them on with strong cries. The
			evening air was pale and chilly and after every charge and
			thud of the footballers the greasy leather orb flew like a heavy
			bird through the grey light. He kept on the fringe of his line,
			out of sight of his prefect, out of the reach of the rude feet,
			feigning to run now and then. He felt his body small and weak
			amid the throng of players and his eyes were weak and watery.
			Rody Kickham was not like that: he would be captain of the
			third line all the fellows said. </p>
		<p>Rody Kickham was a decent fellow but Nasty Roche was a
			stink. Rody Kickham had greaves in his number and a hamper
			in the refectory. Nasty Roche had big hands. He called the
			Friday pudding dog-in-the-blanket. And one day he had
			asked: </p>
		<p><said who="Nasty Roche">—What is your name? </said></p>
		<p>Stephen had answered: </p>
		<p><said who="Stephen">—Stephen Dedalus. </said></p>
		<p>Then Nasty Roche had said: </p>
		<p><said who="Nasty Roche">—What kind of a name is that? </said></p>
		<p>And when Stephen had not been able to answer Nasty
			Roche had asked: </p>
		<p><said who="Nasty Roche">—What is your father? </said></p>
		<p>Stephen had answered: </p>
		<p><said who="Stephen">—A gentleman. </said></p>
		<p>Then Nasty Roche had asked: </p>
		<p><said who="Nasty Roche">—Is he a magistrate? </said></p>
		<p>He crept about from point to point on the fringe of his line,
			making little runs now and then. But his hands were bluish
			with cold. He kept his hands in the sidepockets of his belted
			grey suit. That was a belt round his pocket. And belt was also
			to give a fellow a belt. One day a fellow had said to Cantwell: </p>
		<p><said who="a fellow">—I'd give you such a belt in a second. </said></p>
		<p>Cantwell had answered: </p>
		<p><said who="Cantwell">—Go and fight your match. Give Cecil Thunder a belt. I'd
				like to see you. He'd give you a toe in the rump for yourself.</said></p>
		<p>That was not a nice expression. His mother had told him
			not to speak with the rough boys in the college. Nice mother!
			The first day in the hall of the castle when she had said goodbye
			she had put up her veil double to her nose to kiss him:
			and her nose and eyes were red. But he had pretended not to
			see that she was going to cry. She was a nice mother but she
			was not so nice when she cried. And his father had given him
			two fiveshilling pieces for pocket money. And his father had
			told him if he wanted anything to write home to him and,
			whatever he did, never to peach on a fellow. Then at the door
			of the castle the rector had shaken hands with his father and
			mother, his soutane fluttering in the breeze, and the car had
			driven off with his father and mother on it. They had cried to
			him from the car, waving their hands: </p>

		<said who="Mary Dedalus, Simon Dedalus">
			<p>—Goodbye, Stephen, goodbye! </p>
			<p>—Goodbye, Stephen, goodbye! </p>
		</said>

		<p>He was caught in the whirl of a scrimmage and, fearful of
			the flashing eyes and muddy boots, bent down to look through
			the legs. The fellows were struggling and groaning and their
			legs were rubbing and kicking and stamping. Then Jack Lawton's
			yellow boots dodged out the ball and all the other boots
			and legs ran after. He ran after them a little way and then
			stopped. It was useless to run on. Soon they would be going
			home for the holidays. After supper in the studyhall he would
			change the number pasted up inside his desk from seventyseven
			to seventysix. </p>
		<p>It would be better to be in the studyhall than out there in
			the cold. The sky was pale and cold but there were lights in
			the castle. He wondered from which window Hamilton Rowan
			had thrown his hat on the haha and had there been flowerbeds
			at that time under the windows. One day when he had been
			called to the castle the butler had shown him the marks of the
			soldiers' slugs in the wood of the door and had given him a
			piece of shortbread that the community ate. It was nice and
			warm to see the lights in the castle. It was like something in a
			book. Perhaps Leicester Abbey was like that. And there were
			nice sentences in Doctor Cornwell's Spelling Book. They were
			like poetry but they were only sentences to learn the spelling
			from. </p>

		<lg>
			<l>Wolsey died in Leicester Abbey</l>
			<l>Where the abbots buried him.</l>
			<l>Canker is a disease of plants,</l>
			<l>Cancer one of animals.</l>
		</lg>

		<p>It would be nice to lie on the hearthrug before the fire,
			leaning his head upon his hands, and think on those sentences.
			He shivered as if he had cold slimy water next his skin. That
			was mean of Wells to shoulder him into the square ditch
			because he would not swop his little snuffbox for Wells's
			seasoned hacking chestnut, the conqueror of forty. How cold
			and slimy the water had been! A fellow had once seen a big rat
			jump into the scum. Mother was sitting at the fire with Dante
			waiting for Brigid to bring in the tea. She had her feet on the
			fender and her jewelly slippers were so hot and they had such
			a lovely warm smell! Dante knew a lot of things. She had
			taught him where the Mozambique Channel was and what was
			the longest river in America and what was the name of the
			highest mountain in the moon. Father Arnall knew more than
			Dante because he was a priest but both his father and uncle
			Charles said that Dante was a clever woman and a wellread
			woman. And when Dante made that noise after dinner and
			then put up her hand to her mouth: that was heartburn. </p>
		<p>A voice cried far out on the playground: </p>

		<said who="a voice">
			<p>—All in! </p>
		</said>

		<p>Then other voices cried from the lower and third lines: </p>

		<said who="other voices from the lower and third lines">
			<p>—All in! All in! </p>
		</said>

		<p>The players closed around, flushed and muddy, and he went
			among them, glad to go in. Rody Kickham held the ball by its
			greasy lace. A fellow asked him to give it one last: but he
			walked on without even answering the fellow. Simon Moonan
			told him not to because the prefect was looking. The fellow
			turned to Simon Moonan and said: </p>
		<p><said who="a fellow">—We all know why you speak. You are McGlade's suck.</said></p>
		<p>Suck was a queer word. The fellow called Simon Moonan
			that name because Simon Moonan used to tie the prefect's
			false sleeves behind his back and the prefect used to let on to
			be angry. But the sound was ugly. Once he had washed his
			hands in the lavatory of the Wicklow Hotel and his father
			pulled the stopper up by the chain after and the dirty water
			went down through the hole in the basin. And when it had all
			gone down slowly the hole in the basin had made a sound like
			that: suck. Only louder. </p>
		<p>To remember that and the white look of the lavatory made
			him feel cold and then hot. There were two cocks that you
			turned and water came out: cold and hot. He felt cold and
			then a little hot: and he could see the names printed on the
			cocks. That was a very queer thing. </p>
		<p>And the air in the corridor chilled him too. It was queer and
			wettish. But soon the gas would be lit and in burning it made a
			light noise like a little song. Always the same: and when the
			fellows stopped talking in the playroom you could hear it. </p>
		<p>It was the hour for sums. Father Arnall wrote a hard sum
			on the board and then said: </p>
		<p><said who="Father Arnall">—Now then, who will win? Go ahead, York! Go ahead,
				Lancaster!</said></p>
		<p>Stephen tried his best but the sum was too hard and he felt
			confused. The little silk badge with the white rose on it that
			was pinned on the breast of his jacket began to flutter. He was
			no good at sums but he tried his best so that York might not
			lose. Father Arnall's face looked very black but he was not in
			a wax: he was laughing. Then Jack Lawton cracked his fingers
			and Father Arnall looked at his copybook and said: </p>
		<p><said who="Father Arnall">—Right. Bravo Lancaster! The red rose wins. Come on
				now, York! Forge ahead!</said></p>
		<p>Jack Lawton looked over from his side. The little silk badge
			with the red rose on it looked very rich because he had a blue
			sailor top on.  Stephen felt his own face red too, thinking of all
			the bets about who would get first place in elements, Jack
			Lawton or he. Some weeks Jack Lawton got the card for first
			and some weeks he got the card for first. His white silk badge
			fluttered and fluttered as he worked at the next sum and heard
			Father Arnall's voice. Then all his eagerness passed away and
			he felt his face quite cool. He thought his face must be white
			because it felt so cool. He could not get out the answer for the
			sum but it did not matter. White roses and red roses: those
			were beautiful colours to think of. And the cards for first place
			and second place and third place were beautiful colours too:
			pink and cream and lavender. Lavender and cream and pink
			roses were beautiful to think of. Perhaps a wild rose might be
			like those colours and he remembered the song about the wild
			rose blossoms on the little green place. But you could not have
			a green rose. But perhaps somewhere in the world you could. </p>
		<p>The bell rang and then the classes began to file out of the
			rooms and along the corridors towards the refectory. He sat
			looking at the two prints of butter on his plate but could not
			eat the damp bread. The tablecloth was damp and limp. But
			he drank off the hot weak tea which the clumsy scullion, girt
			with a white apron, poured into his cup. He wondered
			whether the scullion's apron was damp too or whether all
			white things were cold and damp. Nasty Roche and Saurin
			drank cocoa that their people sent them in tins. They said they
			could not drink the tea; that it was hogwash. Their fathers
			were magistrates, the fellows said. </p>
		<p>All the boys seemed to him very strange. They had all
			fathers and mothers and different clothes and voices. He
			longed to be at home and lay his head on his mother's lap. But
			he could not: and so he longed for the play and study and
			prayers to be over and to be in bed. </p>
		<p>He drank another cup of hot tea and Fleming said: </p>
		<p><said who="Fleming">—What's up? Have you a pain or what's up with you? </said></p>
		<p><said who="Stephen">—I don't know, Stephen said. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Fleming">—Sick in your breadbasket, Fleming said, because your
				face looks white. It will go away. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Stephen">—O yes, Stephen said. </said></p>
		<p>But he was not sick there. He thought that he was sick in
			his heart if you could be sick in that place. Fleming was very
			decent to ask him. He wanted to cry. He leaned his elbows on
			the table and shut and opened the flaps of his ears. Then he
			heard the noise of the refectory every time he opened the flaps
			of his ears. It made a roar like a train at night. And when he
			closed the flaps the roar was shut off like a train going into a
			tunnel. That night at Dalkey the train had roared like that and
			then, when it went into the tunnel, the roar stopped. He closed
			his eyes and the train went on, roaring  and then stopping;
			roaring again, stopping. It was nice to hear it roar and stop
			and then roar out of the tunnel again and then stop. </p>
		<p>Then the higher line fellows began to come down along the
			matting in the middle of the refectory, Paddy Rath and Jimmy
			Magee and the Spaniard who was allowed to smoke cigars and
			the little Portuguese who wore the woolly cap. And then the
			lower line tables and the tables of the third line. And every
			single fellow had a different way of walking. </p>
		<p>He sat in a corner of the playroom pretending to watch a
			game of dominos and once or twice he was able to hear for an
			instant the little song of the gas. The prefect was at the door
			with some boys and Simon Moonan was knotting his false
			sleeves. He was telling them something about Tullabeg. </p>
		<p>Then he went away from the door and Wells came over to
			Stephen and said: </p>
		<p><said who="Wells">—Tell us, Dedalus, do you kiss your mother before you go
				to bed? </said></p>
		<p>Stephen answered: </p>
		<p><said who="Stephen">—I do. </said></p>
		<p>Wells turned to the other fellows and said: </p>
		<p><said who="Wells">—O, I say, here's a fellow says he kisses his mother every
				night before he goes to bed. </said></p>
		<p>The other fellows stopped their game and turned round,
			laughing. Stephen blushed under their eyes and said: </p>
		<p><said who="Stephen">—I do not. </said></p>
		<p>Wells said: </p>
		<p><said who="Wells">—O, I say, here's a fellow says he doesn't kiss his mother
				before he goes to bed. </said></p>
		<p>They all laughed again. Stephen tried to laugh with them.
			He felt his whole body hot and confused in a moment. What
			was the right answer to the question? He had given two and
			still Wells laughed. But Wells must know the right answer for
			he was in third of grammar. He tried to think of Wells's
			mother but he did not dare to raise his eyes to Wells's face. He
			did not like Wells's face. It was Wells who had shouldered him
			into the square ditch the day before because he would not
			swop his little snuffbox for Wells's seasoned hacking chestnut,
			the conqueror of forty. It was a mean thing to do; all the
			fellows said it was. And how cold and slimy the water had
			been! And a fellow had once seen a big rat jump plop into the
			scum. </p>
		<p>The cold slime of the ditch covered his whole body; and,
			when the bell rang for study and the lines filed out of the
			playrooms, he felt the cold air of the corridor and staircase
			inside his clothes. He still tried to think what was the right
			answer. Was it right to kiss his mother or wrong to kiss his
			mother? What did that mean, to kiss? You put your face up
			like that to say goodnight and then his mother put her face
			down. That was to kiss. His mother put her lips on his cheek;
			her lips were soft and they wetted his cheek; and they made a
			tiny little noise: kiss. Why did people do that with their two
			faces? </p>
		<p>Sitting in the studyhall he opened the lid of his desk and
			changed the number pasted up inside from seventyseven to
			seventysix. But the Christmas vacation was very far away: but
			one time it would come because the earth moved round always. </p>
		<p>There was a picture of the earth on the first page of his
			geography: a big ball in the middle of clouds. Fleming had a
			box of crayons and one night during free study he had coloured
			the earth green and the clouds maroon. That was like
			the two brushes in Dante's press, the brush with the green
			velvet back for Parnell and the brush with the maroon velvet
			back for Michael Davitt. But he had not told Fleming to
			colour them those colours. Fleming had done it himself. </p>
		<p>He opened the geography to study the lesson; but he could
			not learn the names of places in America. Still they were all
			different places that had those different names. They were all
			in different countries and the countries were in continents and
			the continents were in the world and the world was in the
			universe. </p>
		<p>He turned to the flyleaf of the geography and read what he
			had written there: himself, his name and where he was. </p>

		<lg>
			<l>Stephen Dedalus</l>
			<l>Class of Elements</l>
			<l>Clongowes Wood College</l>
			<l>Sallins</l>
			<l>County Kildare</l>
			<l>Ireland</l>
			<l>Europe</l>
			<l>The World</l>
			<l>The Universe</l>
		</lg>

		<p>That was in his writing: and Fleming one night for a cod
			had written on the opposite page: </p>
		<lg>
			<l>Stephen Dedalus is my name,</l>
			<l>Ireland is my nation.</l>
			<l>Clongowes is my dwellingplace</l>
			<l>And heaven my expectation.</l>
		</lg>

		<p>He read the verses backwards but then they were not poetry.
			Then he read the flyleaf from the bottom to the top till he
			came to his own name. That was he: and he read down the
			page again. What was after the universe? Nothing. But was
			there anything round the universe to show where it stopped
			before the nothing place began? It could not be a wall but
			there could be a thin thin line there all round everything. It
			was very big to think about everything and everywhere. Only
			God could do that. He tried to think what a big thought that
			must be but he could think only of God. God was God's name
			just as his name was Stephen. <emph>Dieu</emph> was the French for God
			and that was God's name too; and when anyone prayed to
			God and said <emph>Dieu</emph> then God knew at once that it was a
			French person that was praying. But though there were
			different names for God in all the different languages in the
			world and God understood what all the people who prayed
			said in their different languages still God remained always the
			same God and God's real name was God. </p>
		<p>It made him very tired to think that way. It made him feel
			his head very big. He turned over the flyleaf and looked
			wearily at the green round earth in the middle of the maroon
			clouds. He wondered which was right, to be for the green or
			for the maroon, because Dante had ripped the green velvet
			back off the brush that was for Parnell one day with her scissors
			and had told him that Parnell was a bad man. He wondered
			if they were arguing at home about that. That was called
			politics. There were two sides in it: Dante was on one side and
			his father and Mr Casey were on the other side but his mother
			and uncle Charles were on no side. Every day there was
			something in the paper about it. </p>
		<p>It pained him that he did not know well what politics meant
			and that he did not know where the universe ended. He felt
			small and weak. When would he be like the fellows in poetry
			and rhetoric? They had big voices and big boots and they
			studied trigonometry. That was very far away. First came the
			vacation and then the next term and then vacation again and
			then again another term and then again the vacation. It was
			like a train going in and out of tunnels and that was like the
			noise of the boys eating in the refectory when you opened and
			closed the flaps of the ears. Term, vacation; tunnel, out; noise,
			stop. How far away it was! It was better to go to bed to sleep.
			Only prayers in the chapel and then bed. He shivered and
			yawned. It would be lovely in bed after the sheets got a bit
			hot. First they were so cold to get into. He shivered to think
			how cold they were first. But then they got hot and then he
			could sleep. It was lovely to be tired. He yawned again. Night
			prayers and then bed: he shivered and wanted to yawn. It
			would be lovely in a few minutes. He felt a warm glow creeping
			up from the cold shivering sheets, warmer and warmer till
			he felt warm all over, ever so warm; ever so warm and yet he
			shivered a little and still wanted to yawn. </p>
		<p>The bell rang for night prayers and he filed out of the studyhall
			after the others and down the staircase and along the
			corridors to the chapel. The corridors were darkly lit and the
			chapel was darkly lit. Soon all would be dark and sleeping.
			There was cold night air in the chapel and the marbles were
			the colour the sea was at night. The sea was cold day and
			night: but it was colder at night. It was cold and dark under
			the seawall beside his father's house. But the kettle would be
			on the hob to make punch. </p>
		<p>The prefect of the chapel prayed above his head and his
			memory knew the responses: </p>

			<lg type="prayer">
				<l>O Lord, open our lips</l>
				<l>And our mouth shall announce Thy praise.</l>
				<l>Incline unto our aid, O God!</l>
				<l>O Lord, make haste to help us!</l>
			</lg>

		<p>There was a cold night smell in the chapel. But it was a holy
			smell. It was not like the smell of the old peasants who knelt at
			the back of the chapel at Sunday mass. That was a smell of air
			and rain and turf and corduroy. But they were very holy
			peasants. They breathed behind him on his neck and sighed as
			they prayed. They lived in Clane, a fellow said: there were
			little cottages there and he had seen a woman standing at the
			halfdoor of a cottage with a child in her arms, as the cars had
			come past from Sallins. It would be lovely to sleep for one
			night in that cottage before the fire of smoking turf, in the
			dark lit by the fire, in the warm dark, breathing the smell of
			the peasants, air and rain and turf and corduroy. But, O, the
			road there between the trees was dark! You would be lost in
			the dark. It made him afraid to think of how it was. </p>
		<p>He heard the voice of the prefect of the chapel saying the
			last prayer. He prayed it too against the dark outside under
			the trees. </p>

		<p>
			<seg type="prayer">
			Visit, we beseech Thee, O Lord, this habitation and
			drive away from it all the snares of the enemy. May Thy
			holy angels dwell herein to preserve us in peace and
			may Thy blessing be always upon us through Christ, Our
			Lord. Amen.
			</seg>
		</p>

		<p>His fingers trembled as he undressed himself in the dormitory.
			He told his fingers to hurry up. He had to undress and
			then kneel and say his own prayers and be in bed before the
			gas was lowered so that he might not go to hell when he died.
			He rolled his stockings off and put on his nightshirt quickly
			and knelt trembling at his bedside and repeated his prayers
			quickly quickly, fearing that the gas would go down. He felt
			his shoulders shaking as he murmured: </p>

		<lg type="prayer">
			<l>God bless my father and my mother and spare them to me!</l>
			<l>God bless my little brothers and sisters and spare them to me!</l>
			<l>God bless Dante and uncle Charles and spare them to me!</l>
		</lg>

		<p>He blessed himself and climbed quickly into bed and,
			tucking the end of the nightshirt under his feet, curled himself
			together under the cold white sheets, shaking and trembling.
			But he would not go to hell when he died; and the shaking
			would stop. A voice bade the boys in the dormitory goodnight.
			He peered out for an instant over the coverlet and saw the
			yellow curtains round and before his bed that shut him off on
			all sides. The light was lowered quietly. </p>
		<p>The prefect's shoes went away. Where? Down the staircase
			and along the corridors or to his room at the end? He saw the
			dark. Was it true about the black dog that walked there at
			night with eyes as big as carriagelamps? They said it was the
			ghost of a murderer. A long shiver of fear flowed over his
			body. He saw the dark entrance hall of the castle. Old servants
			in old dress were in the ironingroom above the staircase. It
			was long ago. The old servants were quiet. There was a fire
			there but the hall was still dark. A figure came up the staircase
			from the hall. He wore the white cloak of a marshal; his face
			was pale and strange; he held his hand pressed to his side. He
			looked out of strange eyes at the old servants. They looked at
			him and saw their master's face and cloak and knew that he
			had received his deathwound. But only the dark was where
			they looked: only dark silent air. Their master had received
			his deathwound on the battlefield of Prague far away over the
			sea. He was standing on the field; his hand was pressed to his
			side; his face was pale and strange and he wore the white
			cloak of a marshal. </p>
		<p>O how cold and strange it was to think of that! All the dark
			was cold and strange. There were pale strange faces there,
			great eyes like carriagelamps. They were the ghosts of murderers,
			the figures of marshals who had received their deathwound
			on battlefields far away over the sea. What did they
			wish to say that their faces were so strange? </p>

		<p>
			<seg type="prayer">
			Visit, we beseech Thee, O Lord, this habitation and drive
			away from it all ...
			</seg>
		</p>

		<p>Going home for the holidays! That would be lovely: the
			fellows had told him. Getting up on the cars in the early wintry
			morning outside the door of the castle. The cars were
			rolling on  the gravel. Cheers for the rector! </p>
		<p>Hurray! Hurray! Hurray! </p>
		<p>The cars drove past the chapel and all caps were raised.
			They drove merrily along the country roads. The drivers
			pointed with their whips to Bodenstown. The fellows cheered.
			They passed the farmhouse of the Jolly Farmer. Cheer after
			cheer after cheer. Through Clane they drove, cheering and
			cheered. The peasant women stood at the halfdoors, the men
			stood here and there. The lovely smell there was in the wintry
			air: the smell of Clane: rain and wintry air and turf smouldering
			and corduroy. </p>
		<p>The train was full of fellows: a long long chocolate train
			with cream facings. The guards went to and fro opening,
			closing, locking, unlocking the doors. They were men in dark
			blue and silver; they had silvery whistles and their keys made
			a quick music: click, click: click, click. </p>
		<p>And the train raced on over the flat lands and past the Hill
			of Allen. The telegraphpoles were passing, passing. The train
			went on and on. It knew. There were coloured lanterns in the
			hall of his father's house and ropes of green branches. There
			were holly and ivy round the pierglass and holly and ivy, green
			and red, twined round the chandeliers. There were red holly
			and green ivy round the old portraits on the walls. Holly and
			ivy for him and for Christmas. </p>
		<p>Lovely ... </p>
		<p>All the people. Welcome home, Stephen! Noises of welcome.
			His mother kissed him. Was that right? His father was a
			marshal now: higher than a magistrate. Welcome home,
			Stephen! </p>
		<p>Noises ... </p>
		<p>There was a noise of curtainrings running back along the
			rods, of water being splashed in the basins. There was a noise
			of rising and dressing and washing in the dormitory: a noise of
			clapping of hands as the prefect went up and down telling the
			fellows to look sharp. A pale sunlight showed the yellow
			curtains drawn back, the tossed beds. His bed was very hot
			and his face and body were very hot. </p>
		<p>He got up and sat on the side of his bed. He was weak. He
			tried to pull on his stocking. It had a horrid rough feel. The
			sunlight was queer and cold. </p>
		<p>Fleming said: </p>
		<p><said who="Fleming">—Are you not well? </said></p>
		<p>He did not know; and Fleming said: </p>
		<p><said who="Fleming">—Get back into bed. I'll tell McGlade you're not well. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Fleming">—He's sick. </said></p>
		<p><said who="">—Who is? </said></p>
		<p><said who="Fleming">—Tell McGlade. </said></p>
		<p><said who="">—Get back into bed. </said></p>
		<p><said who="">—Is he sick? </said></p>
		<p>A fellow held his arms while he loosened the stocking
			clinging to his foot and climbed back into the hot bed. </p>
		<p>He crouched down between the sheets, glad of their tepid
			glow. He heard the fellows talk among themselves about him
			as they dressed for mass. It was a mean thing to do, to shoulder
			him into the square ditch, they were saying. </p>
		<p>Then their voices ceased; they had gone. A voice at his bed
			said: </p>
		<p><said who="Wells">—Dedalus, don't spy on us, sure you won't? </said></p>
		<p>Wells's face was there. He looked at it and saw that Wells
			was afraid. </p>
		<p><said who="Wells">—I didn't mean to. Sure you won't? </said></p>
		<p>His father had told him, whatever he did, never to peach on
			a fellow. He shook his head and answered no and felt glad.
			Wells said: </p>
		<p><said who="Wells">—I didn't mean to, honour bright. It was only for cod. I'm
				sorry. </said></p>
		<p>The face and the voice went away. Sorry because he was
			afraid. Afraid that it was some disease. Canker was a disease
			of plants and cancer one of animals: or another different. That
			was a long time ago then out on the playgrounds in the evening
			light, creeping from point to point on the fringe of his
			line, a heavy bird flying low through the grey light. Leicester
			Abbey lit up. Wolsey died there. The abbots buried him
			themselves. </p>
		<p>It was not Wells's face, it was the prefect's. He was not
			foxing. No, no: he was sick really. He was not foxing. And he
			felt the prefect's hand on his forehead; and he felt his forehead
			warm and damp against the prefect's cold damp hand. That
			was the way a rat felt, slimy and damp and cold. Every rat had
			two eyes to look out of. Sleek slimy coats, little little feet
			tucked up to jump, black shiny eyes to look out of. They could
			understand how to jump. But the minds of rats could not
			understand trigonometry. When they were dead they lay on
			their sides. Their coats dried then. They were only dead
			things. </p>
		<p>The prefect was there again and it was his voice that was
			saying that he was to get up, that Father Minister had said he
			was to get up and dress and go to the infirmary. And while he
			was dressing himself as quickly as he could the prefect said: </p>
		<p><said who="the prefect">—We must pack off to Brother Michael because we have
			the collywobbles! Terrible thing to have the collywobbles!
			How we wobble when we have the collywobbles! </said></p>
		<p>He was very decent to say that. That was all to make him
			laugh. But he could not laugh because his cheeks and lips
			were all shivery: and then the prefect had to laugh by himself. </p>
		<p>The prefect cried: </p>
		<p><said who="the prefect">—Quick march! Hayfoot! Strawfoot! </said></p>
		<p>They went together down the staircase and along the corridor
			and past the bath. As he passed the door he remembered
			with a vague fear the warm turfcoloured bogwater, the warm
			moist air, the noise of plunges, the smell of the towels, like
			medicine. </p>
		<p>Brother Michael was standing at the door of the infirmary
			and from the door of the dark cabinet on his right came a
			smell like medicine. That came from the bottles on the
			shelves. The prefect spoke to Brother Michael and Brother
			Michael answered and called the prefect sir. He had reddish
			hair mixed with grey and a queer look. It was queer that he
			would always be a brother. It was queer too that you could
			not call him sir because he was a brother and had a different
			kind of look. Was he not holy enough or why could he not
			catch up on the others? </p>
		<p>There were two beds in the room and in one bed there was
			a fellow: and when they went in he called out: </p>
		<p><said who="Athy">—Hello! It's young Dedalus! What's up? </said></p>
		<p><said who="Brother Michael">—The sky is up, Brother Michael said. </said></p>
		<p>He was a fellow out of the third of grammar and, while
			Stephen was undressing, he asked Brother Michael to bring
			him a round of buttered toast. </p>
		<p><said who="Athy">—Ah, do! he said. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Brother Michael">—Butter you up! said Brother Michael. You'll get your
				walking papers in the morning when the doctor comes. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Athy">—Will I? the fellow said. I'm not well yet. </said></p>
		<p>Brother Michael repeated: </p>
		<p><said who="Athy">—You'll get your walking papers, I tell you. </said></p>
		<p>He bent down to rake the fire. He had a long back like the
			long back of a tramhorse. He shook the poker gravely and
			nodded his head at the fellow out of third of grammar. </p>
		<p>Then Brother Michael went away and after a while the
			fellow out of third of grammar turned in towards the wall and
			fell asleep. </p>
		<p>That was the infirmary. He was sick then. Had they written
			home to tell his mother and father? But it would be quicker
			for one of the priests to go himself to tell them. Or he would
			write a letter for the priest to bring. </p>

		<lg type="letter">
			<l>Dear Mother</l>
			<l>I am sick. I want to go home. Please come and take me
			home. I am in the infirmary.</l>
			<l>Your fond son,</l>
			<l>Stephen</l>
		</lg>

		<p>How far away they were! There was cold sunlight outside
			the window. He wondered if he would die. You could die just
			the same on a sunny day. He might die before his mother
			came. Then he would have a dead mass in the chapel like the
			way the fellows had told him it was when Little had died. All
			the fellows would be at the mass, dressed in black, all with sad
			faces. Wells too would be there but no fellow would look at
			him. The rector would be there in a cope of black and gold
			and there would be tall yellow candles on the altar and round
			the catafalque. And they would carry the coffin out of the
			chapel slowly and he would be buried in the little graveyard of
			the community off the main avenue of limes. And Wells would
			be sorry then for what he had done. And the bell would toll
			slowly. </p>
		<p>He could hear the tolling. He said over to himself the song
			that Brigid had taught him. </p>

		<lg type="song">
			<l>Dingdong! The castle bell!</l>
			<l>Farewell, my mother!</l>
			<l>Bury me in the old churchyard</l>
			<l>Beside my eldest brother.</l>
			<l>My coffin shall be black,</l>
			<l>Six angels at my back,</l>
			<l>Two to sing and two to pray</l>
			<l>And two to carry my soul away.</l>
		</lg>

		<p>How beautiful and sad that was! How beautiful the words
			were where they said <emph>Bury me in the old churchyard</emph>! A
			tremor passed over his body. How sad and how beautiful! He
			wanted to cry quietly but not for himself: for the words, so
			beautiful and sad, like music. The bell! The bell! Farewell! O
			farewell! </p>
		<p>The cold sunlight was weaker and Brother Michael was
			standing at his bedside with a bowl of beeftea. He was glad for
			his mouth was hot and dry. He could hear them playing on the
			playgrounds. And the day was going on in the college just as if
			he were there. </p>
		<p>Then Brother Michael was going away and the fellow out of
			third of grammar told him to be sure and come back and tell
			him all the news in the paper. He told Stephen that his name
			was Athy and that his father kept a lot of racehorses that were
			spiffing jumpers and that his father would give a good tip to
			Brother Michael any time he wanted it because Brother Michael
			was very decent and always told him the news out of the
			paper they got every day up in the castle. There was every
			kind of news in the paper: accidents, shipwrecks, sports and
			politics. </p>
		<p><said who="Athy">—Now it is all about politics in the paper, he said. Do your
				people talk about that too? </said></p>
		<p><said who="Stephen">—Yes, Stephen said. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Athy">—Mine too, he said. </said></p>
		<p>Then he thought for a moment and said: </p>
		<p><said who="Athy">—You have a queer name, Dedalus, and I have a queer
			name too, Athy. My name is the name of a town. Your name
			is like Latin. </said></p>
		<p>Then he asked: </p>
		<p><said who="Athy">—Are you good at riddles? </said></p>
		<p>Stephen answered: </p>
		<p><said who="Stephen">—Not very good. </said></p>
		<p>Then he said: </p>
		<p><said who="Athy">—Can you answer me this one? Why is the county Kildare
				like the leg of a fellow's breeches? </said></p>
		<p>Stephen thought what could be the answer and then said: </p>
		<p><said who="Stephen">—I give it up. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Athy">—Because there is a thigh in it, he said. Do you see the
			joke? Athy is the town in the county Kildare and a thigh is the
			other thigh. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Stephen">—O, I see, Stephen said. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Athy">—That's an old riddle, he said. </said></p>
		<p>After a moment he said: </p>
		<p><said who="Athy">—I say! </said></p>
		<p><said who="Stephen">—What? asked Stephen. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Athy">—You know, he said, you can ask that riddle another way? </said></p>
		<p><said who="Stephen">—Can you? said Stephen. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Athy">—The same riddle, he said. Do you know the other way to
				ask it? </said></p>
		<p><said who="Stephen">—No, said Stephen. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Athy">—Can you not think of the other way? he said. </said></p>
		<p>He looked at Stephen over the bedclothes as he spoke.
			Then he lay back on the pillow and said: </p>
		<p><said who="Athy">—There is another way but I won't tell you what it is. </said></p>
		<p>Why did he not tell it? His father, who kept the racehorses,
			must be a magistrate too like Saurin's father and Nasty
			Roche's father. He thought of his own father, of how he sang
			songs while his mother played and of how he always gave him
			a shilling when he asked for sixpence and he felt sorry for him
			that he was not a magistrate like the other boys' fathers. Then
			why was he sent to that place with them? But his father had
			told him that he would be no stranger there because his granduncle
			had presented an address to the liberator there fifty
			years before. You could know the people of that time by their
			old dress. It seemed to him a solemn time: and he wondered if
			that was the time when the fellows in Clongowes wore blue
			coats with brass buttons and yellow waistcoats and caps of
			rabbitskin and drank beer like grownup people and kept
			greyhounds of their own to course the hares with. </p>
		<p>He looked at the window and saw that the daylight had
			grown weaker. There would be cloudy grey light over the
			playgrounds. There was no noise on the playgrounds. The
			class must be doing the themes or perhaps Father Arnall was
			reading a legend out of the book. </p>
		<p>It was queer that they had not given him any medicine.
			Perhaps Brother Michael would bring it back when he came.
			They said you got stinking stuff to drink when you were in the
			infirmary. But he felt better now than before. It would be nice
			getting better slowly. You could get a book then. There was a
			book in the library about Holland. There were lovely foreign
			names in it and pictures of strangelooking cities and ships. It
			made you feel so happy. </p>
		<p>How pale the light was at the window! But that was nice.
			The fire rose and fell on the wall. It was like waves. Someone
			had put coal on and he heard voices. They were talking. It was
			the noise of the waves. Or the waves were talking among
			themselves as they rose and fell. </p>
		<p>He saw the sea of waves, long dark waves rising and falling,
			dark under the moonless night. A tiny light twinkled at the
			pierhead where the ship was entering: and he saw a multitude
			of people gathered by the waters' edge to see the ship that
			was entering their harbour. A tall man stood on the deck,
			looking out towards the flat dark land: and by the light at
			the pierhead he saw his face, the sorrowful face of Brother
			Michael. </p>
		<p>He saw him lift his hand towards the people and heard him
			say in a loud voice of sorrow over the waters: </p>
		<p><said who="Brother Michael">—He is dead. We saw him lying upon the catafalque. </said></p>
		<p>A wail of sorrow went up from the people. </p>
		<p><said who="the people">—Parnell! Parnell! He is dead! </said></p>
		<p>They fell upon their knees, moaning in sorrow. </p>
		<p>And he saw Dante in a maroon velvet dress and with a
			green velvet mantle hanging from her shoulders walking
			proudly and silently past the people who knelt by the waters'
			edge. </p>

	<div n="1.3" type="section">

		<p>A great fire, banked high and red, flamed in the grate and
			under the ivytwined branches of the chandelier the Christmas
			table was spread. They had come home a little late and still
			dinner was not ready: but it would be ready in a jiffy, his
			mother had said. They were waiting for the door to open and
			for the servants to come in, holding the big dishes covered
			with their heavy metal covers. </p>
		<p>All were waiting: uncle Charles, who sat far away in the
			shadow of the window, Dante and Mr Casey, who sat in the
			easychairs at either side of the hearth, Stephen, seated on a
			chair between them, his feet resting on the toasted boss. Mr
			Dedalus looked at himself in the pierglass above the mantelpiece,
			waxed out his moustache-ends and then, parting his
			coattails, stood with his back to the glowing fire: and still,
			from time to time, he withdrew a hand from his coattail to
			wax out one of his moustache-ends. Mr Casey leaned his
			head to one side and, smiling, tapped the gland of his neck
			with his fingers. And Stephen smiled too for he knew now that
			it was not true that Mr Casey had a purse of silver in his
			throat. He smiled to think how the silvery noise which Mr
			Casey used to make had deceived him. And when he had tried
			to open Mr Casey's hand to see if the purse of silver was
			hidden there he had seen that the fingers could not be straightened
			out: and Mr Casey had told him that he had got those
			three cramped fingers making a birthday present for Queen
			Victoria. </p>
		<p>Mr Casey tapped the gland of his neck and smiled at Stephen
			with sleepy eyes: and Mr Dedalus said to him: </p>
		<p><said who="Simon Dedalus">—Yes. Well now, that's all right. O, we had a good walk,
			hadn't we, John? Yes ...  I wonder if there's any likelihood
			of dinner this evening. Yes ....  O, well now, we got a good
			breath of ozone round the Head today. Ay, bedad. </said></p>
		<p>He turned to Dante and said: </p>
		<p><said who="John Casey">—You didn't stir out at all, Mrs Riordan? </said></p>
		<p>Dante frowned and said shortly: </p>
		<p><said who="Dante">—No. </said></p>
		<p>Mr Dedalus dropped his coattails and went over to the
			sideboard. He brought forth a great stone jar of whisky from
			the locker and filled the decanter slowly, bending now and
			then to see how much he had poured in. Then replacing the
			jar in the locker he poured a little of the whisky into two
			glasses, added a little water and came back with them to the
			fireplace. </p>
		<p><said who="Simon Dedalus">—A thimbleful, John, he said, just to whet your appetite. </said></p>
		<p>Mr Casey took the glass, drank, and placed it near him on
			the mantelpiece. Then he said: </p>
		<p><said who="John Casey">—Well, I can't help thinking of our friend Christopher
				manufacturing ... </said></p>
		<p>He broke into a fit of laughter and coughing and added: </p>
		<p><said who="John Casey">—... manufacturing that champagne for those fellows. </said></p>
		<p>Mr Dedalus laughed loudly. </p>
		<p><said who="Simon Dedalus">—Is it Christy? he said. There's more cunning in one of
				those warts on his bald head than in a pack of jack foxes. </said></p>
		<p>He inclined his head, closed his eyes, and, licking his lips
			profusely, began to speak with the voice of the hotelkeeper. </p>
		<p><said who="Simon Dedalus">—And he has such a soft mouth when he's speaking to you,
			don't you know. He's very moist and watery about the dewlaps,
			God bless him. </said></p>
		<p>Mr Casey was still struggling through his fit of coughing and
			laughter. Stephen, seeing and hearing the hotelkeeper through
			his father's face and voice, laughed. </p>
		<p>Mr Dedalus put up his eyeglass and, staring down at him,
			said quietly and kindly: </p>
		<p><said who="Simon Dedalus">—What are you laughing at, you little puppy, you? </said></p>
		<p>The servants entered and placed the dishes on the table.
			Mrs Dedalus followed and the places were arranged. </p>
		<p><said who="Mary Dedalus">—Sit over, she said. </said></p>
		<p>Mr Dedalus went to the end of the table and said: </p>
		<p><said who="Simon Dedalus">—Now, Mrs Riordan, sit over. John, sit you down, my
				hearty. </said></p>
		<p>He looked round to where uncle Charles sat and said: </p>
		<p><said who="Simon Dedalus">—Now then, sir, there's a bird here waiting for you. </said></p>
		<p>When all had taken their seats he laid his hand on the cover
			and then said quickly, withdrawing it: </p>
		<p><said who="Simon Dedalus">—Now, Stephen. </said></p>
		<p>Stephen stood up in his place to say the grace before meals: </p>

		<p>
		<seg type="prayer">
			<said who="Stephen">
				<emph>
					<l>Bless us, O Lord, and these Thy gifts which through Thy bounty
				we are about to receive through Christ Our Lord.</l>
					<l>Amen.</l>
				</emph>
			</said>
		</seg>
		</p>

		<p>All blessed themselves and Mr Dedalus with a sigh of
			pleasure lifted from the dish the heavy cover pearled around
			the edge with glistening drops. </p>
		<p>Stephen looked at the plump turkey which had lain, trussed
			and skewered, on the kitchen table. He knew that his father
			had paid a guinea for it in Dunn's of D'Olier Street and that
			the man had prodded it often at the breastbone to show how
			good it was: and he remembered the man's voice when he had
			said: </p>
		<p><said who="the butcher">—Take that one, sir. That's the real Ally Daly. </said></p>
		<p>Why did Mr Barrett in Clongowes call his pandybat a
			turkey? But Clongowes was far away: and the warm heavy
			smell of turkey and ham and celery rose from the plates and
			dishes and the great fire was banked high and red in the grate
			and the green ivy and red holly made you feel so happy and
			when dinner was ended the big plumpudding would be carried
			in, studded with peeled almonds and sprigs of holly, with
			bluish fire running around it and a little green flag flying from
			the top. </p>
		<p>It was his first Christmas dinner and he thought of his little
			brothers and sisters who were waiting in the nursery, as he had
			often waited, till the pudding came. The deep low collar and
			the Eton jacket made him feel queer and oldish: and that
			morning when his mother had brought him down to the parlour,
			dressed for mass, his father had cried. That was because
			he was thinking of his own father. And uncle Charles had
			said so too. </p>
		<p>Mr Dedalus covered the dish and began to eat hungrily.
			Then he said: </p>
		<p><said who="Simon Dedalus">—Poor old Christy, he's nearly lopsided now with roguery. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Mary Dedalus">—Simon, said Mrs Dedalus, you haven't given Mrs Riordan
				any sauce. </said></p>
		<p>Mr Dedalus seized the sauceboat. </p>
		<p><said who="Simon Dedalus">—Haven't I?  he cried. Mrs Riordan, pity the poor blind. </said></p>
		<p>Dante covered her plate with her hands and said: </p>
		<p><said who="Dante">—No, thanks. </said></p>
		<p>Mr Dedalus turned to uncle Charles. </p>
		<p><said who="Simon Dedalus">—How are you off, sir? </said></p>
		<p><said who="Uncle Charles">—Right as the mail, Simon. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Simon Dedalus">—You, John? </said></p>
		<p><said who="John Casey">—I'm all right. Go on yourself. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Simon Dedalus">—Mary? Here, Stephen, here's something to make your
				hair curl. </said></p>
		<p>He poured sauce freely over Stephen's plate and set the
			boat again on the table. Then he asked uncle Charles was it
			tender. Uncle Charles could not speak because his mouth
			was full but he nodded that it was. </p>
		<p><said who="Simon Dedalus">—That was a good answer our friend made to the canon.
				What? said Mr Dedalus. </said></p>
		<p><said who="John Casey">—I didn't think he had that much in him, said Mr Casey. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Simon Dedalus">—<quote>I'll pay you your dues, father, when you cease turning the
						house of God into a pollingbooth.</quote></said></p>
		<p><said who="Dante">—A nice answer, said Dante, for any man calling himself a
				catholic to give to his priest. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Simon Dedalus">—They have only themselves to blame, said Mr Dedalus
			suavely. If they took a fool's advice they would confine their
			attention to religion. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Dante">—It is religion, Dante said. They are doing their duty in
			warning the people. </said></p>
		<p><said who="John Casey">—We go to the house of God, Mr Casey said, in all humility
			to pray to our Maker and not to hear election addresses. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Dante">—It is religion, Dante said again. They are right. They must
			direct their flocks. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Simon Dedalus">—And preach politics from the altar, is it? asked Mr Dedalus. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Dante">—Certainly, said Dante. It is a question of public morality.
			A priest would not be a priest if he did not tell his flock what is
			right and what is wrong. </said></p>
		<p>Mrs Dedalus laid down her knife and fork, saying: </p>
		<p><said who="Mary Dedalus">—For pity's sake and for pity sake let us have no political
				discussion on this day of all days in the year. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Uncle Charles">—Quite right, ma'am, said uncle Charles. Now, Simon,
				that's quite enough now. Not another word now. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Simon Dedalus">—Yes, yes, said Mr Dedalus quickly. </said></p>
		<p>He uncovered the dish boldly and said: </p>
		<p><said who="Simon Dedalus">—Now then, who's for more turkey? </said></p>
		<p>Nobody answered. Dante said: </p>
		<p><said who="Dante">—Nice language for any catholic to use! </said></p>
		<p><said who="Mary Dedalus">—Mrs Riordan, I appeal to you, said Mrs Dedalus, to let
				the matter drop now. </said></p>
		<p>Dante turned on her and said: </p>
		<p><said who="Dante">—And am I to sit here and listen to the pastors of my
				church being flouted? </said></p>
		<p><said who="Simon Dedalus">—Nobody is saying a word against them, said Mr Dedalus,
				so long as they don't meddle in politics. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Dante">—The bishops and priests of Ireland have spoken, said
				Dante, and they must be obeyed. </said></p>
		<p><said who="John Casey">—Let them leave politics alone, said Mr Casey, or the
				people may leave their church alone. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Dante">—You hear? said Dante turning to Mrs Dedalus. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Mary Dedalus">—Mr Casey! Simon! said Mrs Dedalus. Let it end now. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Uncle Charles">—Too bad! Too bad! said uncle Charles. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Simon Dedalus">—What? cried Mr Dedalus. Were we to desert him at the
				bidding of the English people? </said></p>
		<p><said who="Dante">—He was no longer worthy to lead, said Dante. He was a
				public sinner. </said></p>
		<p><said who="John Casey">—We are all sinners and black sinners, said Mr Casey
				coldly. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Dante">—<quote><ref>Matthew 18.7</ref>>Woe be to the man by whom the scandal cometh!</quote> said
			Mrs Riordan. <quote><ref>Luke 17.1-2</ref>It would be better for him that a millstone were
			tied about his neck and that he were cast into the depth of the
			sea rather than that he should scandalise one of these, my least
			little ones.</quote> That is the language of the Holy Ghost.</said></p>
		<p><said who="Simon Dedalus">—And very bad language if you ask me, said Mr Dedalus
		coolly. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Uncle Charles">—Simon! Simon! said uncle Charles. The boy. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Simon Dedalus">—Yes, yes, said Mr Dedalus. I meant about the ... I
			was thinking about the bad language of that railway porter.
			Well now, that's all right. Here, Stephen, show me your plate,
			old chap. Eat away now. Here. </said></p>
		<p>He heaped up the food on Stephen's plate and served uncle
			Charles and Mr Casey to large pieces of turkey and splashes
			of sauce. Mrs Dedalus was eating little and Dante sat with her
			hands in her lap. She was red in the face. Mr Dedalus rooted
			with the carvers at the end of the dish and said: </p>
		<p><said who="Simon Dedalus">—There's a tasty bit here we call the pope's nose. If any
				lady or gentleman ... </said></p>
		<p>He held a piece of fowl up on the prong of the carvingfork.
			Nobody spoke. He put it on his own plate, saying: </p>
		<p><said who="Simon Dedalus">—Well, you can't say but you were asked. I think I had
				better eat it myself because I'm not well in my health lately. </said></p>
		<p>He winked at Stephen and, replacing the dishcover, began
			to eat again. </p>
		<p>There was a silence while he ate. Then he said: </p>
		<p><said who="Simon Dedalus">—Well now, the day kept up fine after all. There were
				plenty of strangers down too. </said></p>
		<p>Nobody spoke. He said again: </p>
		<p><said who="Simon Dedalus">—I think there were more strangers down than last
				Christmas. </said></p>
		<p>He looked round at the others whose faces were bent towards
			their plates and, receiving no reply, waited for a moment
			and said bitterly: </p>
		<p><said who="Simon Dedalus">—Well, my Christmas dinner has been spoiled anyhow. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Dante">—There could be neither luck nor grace, Dante said, in a
				house where there is no respect for the pastors of the church. </said></p>
		<p>Mr Dedalus threw his knife and fork noisily on his plate. </p>
		<p><said who="Simon Dedalus">—Respect! he said. Is it for Billy with the lip or for the tub
				of guts up in Armagh? Respect! </said></p>
		<p><said who="John Casey">—Princes of the church, said Mr Casey with slow scorn. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Simon Dedalus">—Lord Leitrim's coachman, yes, said Mr Dedalus. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Dante">—They are the Lord's anointed, Dante said. They are an
				honour to their country. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Simon Dedalus">—Tub of guts, said Mr Dedalus coarsely. He has a handsome
			face, mind you, in repose. You should see that fellow
			lapping up his bacon and cabbage of a cold winter's day. O
			Johnny! </said></p>
		<p>He twisted his features into a grimace of heavy bestiality
			and made a lapping noise with his lips. </p>
		<p><said who="Mary Dedalus">—Really, Simon, said Mrs Dedalus, you should not speak
				that way before Stephen. It's not right. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Dante">—O, he'll remember all this when he grows up, said Dante
			hotly - the language he heard against God and religion and
			priests in his own home. </said></p>
		<p><said who="John Casey">—Let him remember too, cried Mr Casey to her from
			across the table, the language with which the priests and the
			priests' pawns broke Parnell's heart and hounded him into
			his grave. Let him remember that too when he grows up. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Simon Dedalus">—Sons of bitches! cried Mr Dedalus. When he was down
			they turned on him to betray him and rend him like rats in a
			sewer. Lowlived dogs! And they look it! By Christ, they look
			it! </said></p>
		<p><said who="Dante">—They behaved rightly, cried Dante. They obeyed their
				bishops and their priests. Honour to them! </said></p>
		<p><said who="Mary Dedalus">—Well, it is perfectly dreadful to say that not even for one
			day in the year, said Mrs Dedalus, can we be free from these
			dreadful disputes! </said></p>
		<p>Uncle Charles raised his hands mildly and said: </p>
		<p><said who="Uncle Charles">—Come now, come now, come now! Can we not have our
			opinions whatever they are without this bad temper and this
			bad language? It is too bad surely. </said></p>
		<p>Mrs Dedalus spoke to Dante in a low voice but Dante said
			loudly: </p>
		<p><said who="Dante">—I will not say nothing. I will defend my church and my
				religion when it is insulted and spit on by renegade catholics. </said></p>
		<p>Mr Casey pushed his plate rudely into the middle of the
			table and, resting his elbows before him, said in a hoarse voice
			to his host: </p>
		<p><said who="John Casey">—Tell me, did I tell you that story about a very famous
				spit? </said></p>
		<p><said who="Simon Dedalus">—You did not, John, said Mr Dedalus. </said></p>
		<p><said who="John Casey">—Why then, said Mr Casey, it is a most instructive story. It
			happened not long ago in the county Wicklow where we are
			now. </said></p>
		<p>He broke off and, turning towards Dante, said with quiet
			indignation: </p>
		<p><said who="John Casey">—And I may tell you, ma'am, that I, if you mean me, am
			no renegade catholic. I am a catholic as my father was and his
			father before him and his father before him again when we
			gave up our lives rather than sell our faith. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Dante">—The more shame to you now, Dante said, to speak as you
				do. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Simon Dedalus">—The story, John, said Mr Dedalus smiling. Let us have
				the story anyhow. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Dante">—Catholic indeed! repeated Dante ironically. The blackest
			protestant in the land would not speak the language I have
			heard this evening. </said></p>
		<p>Mr Dedalus began to sway his head to and fro, crooning
			like a country singer. </p>
		<p><said who="John Casey">—I am no protestant, I tell you again, said Mr Casey flushing. </said></p>
		<p>Mr Dedalus, still crooning and swaying his head, began to
			sing in a grunting nasal tone: </p>

		<said who="Simon Dedalus">
			<seg type="song">
				<lg>
					<l>O, come all you Roman catholics</l>
					<l>That never went to mass.</l>
				</lg>
			</seg>
		</said>

		<p>He took up his knife and fork again in good humour and set
			to eating, saying to Mr Casey: </p>
		<p><said who="Simon Dedalus">—Let us have the story, John. It will help us to digest. </said></p>
		<p>Stephen looked with affection at Mr Casey's face which
			stared across the table over his joined hands. He liked to sit
			near him at the fire, looking up at his dark fierce face. But his
			dark eyes were never fierce and his slow voice was good to
			listen to. But why was he then against the priests? Because
			Dante must be right then. But he had heard his father say that
			she was a spoiled nun and that she had come out of the convent
			in the Alleghanies when her brother had got the money
			from the savages for the trinkets and the chainies. Perhaps
			that made her severe against Parnell. And she did not like him
			to play with Eileen because Eileen was a protestant and when
			she was young she knew children that used to play with protestants
			and the protestants used to make fun of the litany of
			the Blessed Virgin. <emph>Tower of Ivory</emph>, they used to say,
			<emph>House of Gold!</emph> How could a woman be a tower of ivory or a house of
			gold? Who was right then? And he remembered the evening in
			the infirmary in Clongowes, the dark waters, the light at the
			pierhead and the moan of sorrow from the people when they
			had heard. </p>
		<p>Eileen had long white hands. One evening when playing tig
			she had put her hands over his eyes: long and white and thin
			and cold and soft. That was ivory: a cold white thing. That
			was the meaning of <emph>Tower of Ivory</emph>. </p>
		<p><said who="John Casey">—The story is very short and sweet, Mr Casey said. It was
			one day down in Arklow, a cold bitter day, not long before the
			chief died. May God have mercy on him! </said></p>
		<p>He closed his eyes wearily and paused. Mr Dedalus took a
			bone from his plate and tore some meat from it with his teeth,
			saying: </p>
		<p><said who="Simon Dedalus">—Before he was killed, you mean. </said></p>
		<p>Mr Casey opened his eyes, sighed and went on: </p>
		<p><said who="John Casey">—It was down in Arklow one day. We were down there at
			a meeting and after the meeting was over we had to make our
			way to the railway station through the crowd. Such booing
			and baaing, man, you never heard. They called us all the
			names in the world. Well there was one old lady, and a
			drunken old harridan she was surely, that paid all her attention
			to me. She kept dancing along beside me in the mud
			bawling and screaming into my face: <emph>Priesthunter! The Paris
				Funds! Mr Fox! Kitty O'Shea!</emph> </said></p>
		<p><said who="Simon Dedalus">—And what did you do, John? asked Mr Dedalus. </said></p>
		<p><said who="John Casey">—I let her bawl away, said Mr Casey. It was a cold day and
				to keep up my heart I had (saving your presence, ma'am) a
				quid of Tullamore in my mouth and sure I couldn't say a word
				in any case because my mouth was full of tobacco juice. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Simon Dedalus">—Well, John? </said></p>
		<p><said who="John Casey">—Well. I let her bawl away, to her heart's content, <emph>Kitty O'Shea</emph>
			and the rest of it till at last she called that lady a name
			that I won't sully this Christmas board nor your ears, ma'am,
			nor my own lips by repeating. </said></p>
		<p>He paused. Mr Dedalus, lifting his head from the bone,
			asked: </p>
		<p><said who="Simon Dedalus">—And what did you do, John? </said></p>
		<p><said who="John Casey">—Do! said Mr Casey. She stuck her ugly old face up at me
			when she said it and I had my mouth full of tobacco juice. I
			bent down to her and <emph>Phth!</emph> says I to her like that. </said></p>
		<p>He turned aside and made the act of spitting. </p>
		<p><said who="John Casey">—<emph>Phth!</emph> says I to her like that, right into her eye. </said></p>
		<p>He clapped a hand to his eye and gave a hoarse scream of
			pain. </p>
		<p><said who="John Casey">—<emph>O Jesus, Mary and Joseph!</emph> says she. <emph>I'm blinded! I'm
					blinded and drownded!</emph> </said></p>
		<p>He stopped in a fit of coughing and laughter, repeating: </p>
		<p><said who="John Casey">—<emph>I'm blinded entirely.</emph> </said></p>
		<p>Mr Dedalus laughed loudly and lay back in his chair while
			uncle Charles swayed his head to and fro. </p>
		<p>Dante looked terribly angry and repeated while they
			laughed: </p>
		<p><said who="Dante">—Very nice! Ha! Very nice! </said></p>
		<p>It was not nice about the spit in the woman's eye. But what
			was the name the woman had called Kitty O'Shea that Mr
			Casey would not repeat? He thought of Mr Casey walking
			through the crowds of people and making speeches from a
			wagonette. That was what he had been in prison for and he
			remembered that one night Sergeant O'Neill had come to the
			house and had stood in the hall, talking in a low voice with his
			father and chewing nervously at the chinstrap of his cap. And
			that night Mr Casey had not gone to Dublin by train but a car
			had come to the door and he had heard his father say something
			about the Cabinteely road. </p>
		<p>He was for Ireland and Parnell and so was his father: and
			so was Dante too for one night at the band on the esplanade
			she had hit a gentleman on the head with her umbrella because
			he had taken off his hat when the band played <emph>God save
			the Queen</emph> at the end. </p>
		<p>Mr Dedalus gave a snort of contempt. </p>
		<p><said who="Simon Dedalus">—Ah, John, he said. It is true for them. We are an unfortunate
			priestridden race and always were and always will be till
			the end of the chapter. </said></p>
		<p>Uncle Charles shook his head, saying: </p>
		<p><said who="Uncle Charles">—A bad business! A bad business! </said></p>
		<p>Mr Dedalus repeated: </p>
		<p><said who="Simon Dedalus">—A priestridden Godforsaken race! </said></p>
		<p>He pointed to the portrait of his grandfather on the wall to
			his right. </p>
		<p><said who="Simon Dedalus">—Do you see that old chap up there, John? he said. He was
			a good Irishman when there was no money in the job. He was
			condemned to death as a whiteboy. But he had a saying about
			our clerical friends, that he would never let one of them put
			his two feet under his mahogany. </said></p>
		<p>Dante broke in angrily: </p>
		<p><said who="Dante">—If we are a priestridden race we ought to be proud of it!
				They are the apple of God's eye.

				<quote><ref>Zacharia 2:8</ref><emph>Touch them not, says Christ,
				for they are the apple of My eye.</emph></quote></said></p>

		<p><said who="John Casey">—And can we not love our country then? asked Mr
			Casey. Are we not to follow the man that was born to lead
			us? </said></p>
		<p><said who="Dante">—A traitor to his country! replied Dante. A traitor, an
			adulterer! The priests were right to abandon him. The priests
			were always the true friends of Ireland. </said></p>
		<p><said who="John Casey">—Were they, faith? said Mr Casey. </said></p>
		<p>He threw his fist on the table and, frowning angrily, protruded
			one finger after another. </p>
		<p><said who="John Casey">—Didn't the bishops of Ireland betray us in the time of the
			union when bishop Lanigan presented an address of loyalty to
			the Marquess Cornwallis? Didn't the bishops and priests sell
			the aspirations of their country in 1829 in return for catholic
			emancipation? Didn't they denounce the fenian movement
			from the pulpit and in the confessionbox? And didn't they
			dishonour the ashes of Terence Bellew MacManus? </said></p>
		<p>His face was glowing with anger and Stephen felt the glow
			rise to his own cheek as the spoken words thrilled him. Mr
			Dedalus uttered a guffaw of coarse scorn. </p>
		<p><said who="John Casey">—O, by God, he cried, I forgot little old Paul Cullen!
				Another apple of God's eye! </said></p>
		<p>Dante bent across the table and cried to Mr Casey: </p>
		<p><said who="Dante">—Right! Right! They were always right! God and morality
				and religion come first. </said></p>
		<p>Mrs Dedalus, seeing her excitement, said to her: </p>
		<p><said who="Mary Dedalus">—Mrs Riordan, don't excite yourself answering them. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Dante">—God and religion before everything! Dante cried. God
				and religion before the world! </said></p>
		<p>Mr Casey raised his clenched fist and brought it down on
			the table with a crash. </p>
		<p><said who="John Casey">—Very well, then, he shouted hoarsely, if it comes to that,
				no God for Ireland! </said></p>
		<p><said who="Simon Dedalus">—John! John! cried Mr Dedalus, seizing his guest by the
				coatsleeve. </said></p>
		<p>Dante stared across the table, her cheeks shaking. Mr
			Casey struggled up from his chair and bent across the table
			towards her, scraping the air from before his eyes with one
			hand as though he were tearing aside a cobweb. </p>
		<p><said who="John Casey">—No God for Ireland! he cried. We have had too much
				God in Ireland. Away with God! </said></p>
		<p><said who="Dante">—Blasphemer! Devil! screamed Dante, starting to her feet
				and almost spitting in his face. </said></p>
		<p>Uncle Charles and Mr Dedalus pulled Mr Casey back into
			his chair again, talking to him from both sides reasonably. He
			stared before him out of his dark flaming eyes, repeating: </p>
		<p><said who="John Casey">—Away with God, I say! </said></p>
		<p>Dante shoved her chair violently aside and left the table,
			upsetting her napkinring which rolled slowly along the carpet
			and came to rest against the foot of an easychair. Mrs
			Dedalus rose quickly and followed her towards the door. At
			the door Dante turned round violently and shouted down the
			room, her cheeks flushed and quivering with rage: </p>
		<p><said who="Dante">—Devil out of hell! We won! We crushed him to death!
				Fiend! </said></p>
		<p>The door slammed behind her. </p>
		<p>Mr Casey, freeing his arms from his holders, suddenly
			bowed his head on his hands with a sob of pain. </p>
		<p><said who="John Casey">—Poor Parnell! he cried loudly. My dead king! </said></p>
		<p>He sobbed loudly and bitterly. </p>
		<p>Stephen, raising his terrorstricken face, saw that his father's
			eyes were full of tears. </p>

		<p>The fellows talked together in little groups. </p>
		<p>One fellow said: </p>
		<p><said who="a fellow">—They were caught near the Hill of Lyons. </said></p>
		<p><said who="a fellow">—Who caught them? </said></p>
		<p><said who="a fellow">—Mr Gleeson and the minister. They were on a car. </said></p>
		<p>The same fellow added: </p>
		<p><said who="a fellow">—A fellow in the higher line told me. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Fleming">Fleming asked: </said></p>
		<p><said who="a fellow">—But why did they run away, tell us? </said></p>
		<p><said who="Cecil Thunder">—I know why, Cecil Thunder said. Because they had
				fecked cash out of the rector's room. </said></p>
		<p><said who="a fellow">—Who fecked it? </said></p>
		<p><said who="John Casey">—Kickham's brother. And they all went shares in it. </said></p>
		<p>But that was stealing. How could they have done that? </p>
		<p><said who="Wells">—A fat lot you know about it, Thunder! Wells said. I know
				why they scut. </said></p>
		<p><said who="a fellow">—Tell us why. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Wells">—I was told not to, Wells said. </said></p>
		<p><said who="all">—O, go on, Wells, all said. You might tell us. We won't let
				it out. </said></p>
		<p>Stephen bent forward his head to hear. Wells looked round
			to see if anyone was coming. Then he said secretly: </p>
		<p><said who="Wells">—You know the altar wine they keep in the press in the
				sacristy? </said></p>
		<p><said who="all">—Yes. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Wells">—Well, they drank that and it was found out who did it by
				the smell. And that's why they ran away, if you want to know. </said></p>
		<p>And the fellow who had spoken first said: </p>
		<p><said who="a fellow">—Yes, that's what I heard too from the fellow in the higher
				line. </said></p>
		<p>The fellows were all silent. Stephen stood among them,
			afraid to speak, listening. A faint sickness of awe made him
			feel weak. How could they have done that? He thought of the
			dark silent sacristy. There were dark wooden presses there
			where the crimped surplices lay quietly folded. It was not the
			chapel but still you had to speak under your breath. It was a
			holy place. He remembered the summer evening he had been
			there to be dressed as boatbearer, the evening of the procession
			to the little altar in the wood. A strange and holy place.
			The boy that held the censer had swung it gently to and fro
			near the door with the silvery cap lifted by the middle chain
			to keep the coals lighting. That was called charcoal: and it
			had burned quietly as the fellow had swung it gently and had
			given off a weak sour smell. And then when all were vested
			he had stood holding out the boat to the rector and the rector
			had put a spoonful of incense in it and it had hissed on the
			red coals. </p>
		<p>The fellows were talking together in little groups here and
			there on the playground. The fellows seemed to him to have
			grown smaller: that was because a sprinter had knocked him
			down the day before, a fellow out of second of grammar. He
			had been thrown by the fellow's machine lightly on the cinderpath
			and his spectacles had been broken in three pieces and
			some of the grit of the cinders had gone into his mouth. </p>
		<p>That was why the fellows seemed to him smaller and
			farther away and the goalposts so thin and far and the soft
			grey sky so high up. But there was no play on the football
			grounds for cricket was coming: and some said that Barnes
			would be the prof and some said it would be Flowers. And all
			over the playgrounds they were playing rounders and bowling
			twisters and lobs. And from here and from there came the
			sounds of the cricketbats through the soft grey air. They said:
			pick, pack, pock, puck: like drops of water in a fountain
			slowly falling in the brimming bowl. </p>
		<p>Athy, who had been silent, said quietly: </p>
		<p><said who="Athy">—You are all wrong. </said></p>
		<p>All turned towards him eagerly. </p>
		<p><said who="a fellow">—Why? </said></p>
		<p><said who="a fellow">—Do you know? </said></p>
		<p><said who="a fellow">—Who told you? </said></p>
		<p><said who="a fellow">—Tell us, Athy. </said></p>
		<p>Athy pointed across the playground to where Simon Moonan
			was walking by himself kicking a stone before him. </p>
		<p><said who="Athy">—Ask him, he said. </said></p>
		<p>The fellows looked there and then said: </p>
		<p><said who="a fellow">—Why him? </said></p>
		<p><said who="a fellow">—Is he in it? </said></p>
		<p><said who="a fellow">—Tell us, Athy. Go on. You might if you know. </said></p>
		<p>Athy lowered his voice and said: </p>
		<p><said who="Athy">—Do you know why those fellows scut? I will tell you but
				you must not let on you know. </said></p>
		<p>He paused for a moment and then said mysteriously: </p>
		<p><said who="Athy">—They were caught with Simon Moonan and Tusker Boyle
				in the square one night. </said></p>
		<p>The fellows looked at him and asked: </p>
		<p><said who="a fellow">—Caught? </said></p>
		<p><said who="a fellow">—What doing? </said></p>
		<p>Athy said: </p>
		<p><said who="Athy">—Smugging. </said></p>
		<p>All the fellows were silent: and Athy said: </p>
		<p><said who="Athy">—And that's why. </said></p>
		<p>Stephen looked at the faces of the fellows but they were all
			looking across the playground. He wanted to ask somebody
			about it. What did that mean about the smugging in the
			square? Why did the five fellows out of the higher line run
			away for that? It was a joke, he thought. Simon Moonan had
			nice clothes and one night he had shown him a ball of creamy
			sweets that the fellows of the football fifteen had rolled down
			to him along the carpet in the middle of the refectory when he
			was at the door. It was the night of the match against the
			Bective Rangers and the ball was made just like a red and
			green apple only it opened and it was full of the creamy
			sweets. And one day Boyle had said that an elephant had two
			tuskers instead of two tusks and that was why he was called
			Tusker Boyle but some fellows called him Lady Boyle because
			he was always at his nails, paring them. </p>
		<p>Eileen had long thin cool white hands too because she was a
			girl. They were like ivory; only soft. That was the meaning of
			<emph>Tower of Ivory</emph> but protestants could not understand it and
			made fun of it. One day he had stood beside her looking into
			the hotel grounds. A waiter was running up a trail of bunting
			on the flagstaff and a fox terrier was scampering to and fro on
			the sunny lawn. She had put her hand into his pocket where
			his hand was and he had felt how cool and thin and soft her
			hand was. She had said that pockets were funny things to
			have: and then all of a sudden she had broken away and had
			run laughing down the sloping curve of the path. Her fair hair
			had streamed out behind her like gold in the sun. <emph>Tower of
			Ivory. House of Gold.</emph> By thinking of things you could understand
			them. </p>
		<p>But why in the square? You went there when you wanted to
			do something. It was all thick slabs of slate and water trickled
			all day out of tiny pinholes and there was a queer smell of stale
			water there. And behind the door of one of the  closets there
			was a drawing in red pencil of a bearded man in a Roman
			dress with a brick in each hand and underneath was the name
			of the drawing: </p>

		<l><emph>Balbus was building a wall.</emph> </l>

		<p>Some fellows had drawn it there for a cod. It had a funny
			face but it was very like a man with a beard. And on the wall
			of another closet there was written in backhand  in beautiful
			writing: </p>

		<l>Julius Caesar wrote The Calico Belly. </l>

		<p>Perhaps that was why they were there  because it was a
			place where some fellows wrote things for cod. But all the
			same it was queer what Athy said and the way he said it. It
			was not a cod because they had run away. He looked with the
			others in silence across the playground and began to feel
			afraid. </p>
		<p>At last Fleming said: </p>
		<p><said who="Fleming">—And we are all to be punished for what other fellows did? </said></p>
		<p><said who="Cecil Thunder">—I won't come back, see if I do, Cecil Thunder said. Three
				days' silence in the refectory and sending us up for six and
				eight every minute. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Wells">—Yes, said Wells. And old Barrett has a new way of twisting
				the note so that you can't open it and fold it again to see
				how many ferul#.^a  you are to get. I won't come back too. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Cecil Thunder">—Yes, said Cecil Thunder, and the prefect of studies was in
				second of grammar this morning. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Fleming">—Let us get up a rebellion, Fleming said. Will we? </said></p>
		<p>All the fellows were silent. The air was very silent and you
			could hear the cricketbats but more slowly than before: pick,
			pock. </p>
		<p>Wells asked: </p>
		<p><said who="Wells">—What is going to be done to them? </said></p>
		<p><said who="Athy">—Simon Moonan and Tusker are going to be flogged, Athy
				said, and the fellows in the higher line got their choice of
				flogging or being expelled. </said></p>
		<p><said who="a fellow">—And which are they taking? asked the fellow who had
				spoken first. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Athy">—All are taking expulsion except Corrigan, Athy answered.
				He's going to be flogged by Mr Gleeson. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Fleming">—Is it Corrigan that big fellow? said Fleming. Why, he'd be
				able for two of Gleeson! </said></p>
		<p><said who="Cecil Thunder">—I know why, Cecil Thunder said. He is right and the
				other fellows are wrong because a flogging wears off after a bit
				but a fellow that has been expelled from college is known all
				his life on  account of it. Besides Gleeson won't flog him hard. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Fleming">—It's best of his play not to, Fleming said. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Cecil Thunder">—I wouldn't like to be Simon Moonan and Tusker,  Cecil
				Thunder said. But I don't believe they will be flogged. Perhaps
				they will be sent up for twice nine. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Athy">—No, no, said Athy. They'll both get it on the vital spot. </said></p>
		<p>Wells rubbed himself and said in a crying voice: </p>
		<p><said who="Wells">—Please, sir, let me off! </said></p>
		<p>Athy grinned and turned up the sleeves of his jacket, saying: </p>

		<said who="Athy">
			<seg type="chant">
				<lg>
					<l>It can't be helped;</l>
					<l>It must be done.</l>
					<l>So down with your breeches</l>
					<l>And out with your bum.</l>
				</lg>
			</seg>
		</said>

		<p>The fellows laughed; but he felt that they were a little
			afraid. In the silence of the soft grey air he heard the cricket-bats
			from here and from there: pock. That was a sound to
			hear but if you were hit then you would feel a pain. The pandybat
			made a sound too but not like that. The fellows said it
			was made of whalebone and leather with lead inside: and he
			wondered what was the pain like. There were different kinds
			of pains  for all the different kinds of sounds. A long thin cane
			would have a high whistling sound and he wondered what was
			that pain like. It made him shivery to think of it and cold: and
			what Athy said too. But what was there to laugh at in it? It
			made him shivery: but that was because you always felt like a
			shiver when you let down your trousers. It was the same in the
			bath when you undressed yourself. He wondered who had to
			let them down, the master or the boy himself. O how could
			they laugh about it that way? </p>
		<p>He looked at Athy's rolledup sleeves and knuckly inky
			hands. He had rolled up his sleeves to show how Mr Gleeson
			would roll up his sleeves. But Mr Gleeson had round shiny
			cuffs and clean white wrists and fattish white hands and the
			nails of them were long and pointed. Perhaps he pared them
			too like Lady Boyle. But they were terribly long and pointed
			nails. So long and cruel they were though the white fattish
			hands were not cruel but gentle. And though he trembled with
			cold and fright to think of the cruel long nails and of the high
			whistling sound of the cane and of the chill you felt at the end
			of your shirt when you undressed yourself yet he felt a feeling
			of queer quiet pleasure inside him to think of the white fattish
			hands, clean and strong  and gentle. And he thought of what
			Cecil Thunder had said; that Mr Gleeson would not flog
			Corrigan hard. And Fleming had said he would not because it
			was  best of his play not to. But that was not why. </p>
		<p>A voice from far out on the playground cried: </p>
		<p><said who="a fellow">—All in! </said></p>
		<p>And other voices cried: </p>
		<p><said who="other voices">—All in! All in! </said></p>
		<p>During the writing lesson he sat with his arms folded,
			listening to the slow scraping of the pens. Mr Harford went to
			and fro making little signs in red pencil and sometimes sitting
			beside the boy to show him how to hold the pen. He had tried
			to spell out the headline for himself though he knew already
			what it was for it was the last of the book. <emph>Zeal without prudence
			is like a ship adrift.</emph> But the lines of the letters were like
			fine invisible threads and it was only by closing his right eye
			tight tight and staring out of the left eye that he could make
			out the full curves of the capital. </p>
		<p>But Mr Harford was very decent and never got into a wax.
			All the other masters got into dreadful waxes. But why were
			they to suffer for what fellows in the higher line did? Wells had
			said that they had drunk some of the altar wine out of the
			press in the sacristy and that it had been found out who had
			done it by the smell. Perhaps they had stolen a monstrance to
			run away with it and sell it somewhere. That must have been a
			terrible sin, to go in there quietly at night, to open the dark
			press and steal the flashing gold thing into which God was put
			on the altar in the middle of flowers and candles at benediction
			while the incense went up in clouds at both sides as the
			fellow swung the censer and Dominic Kelly sang the first part
			by himself in the choir. But God was not in it of course when
			they stole it. But still it was a strange and a great sin even to
			touch it. He thought of it with deep awe; a terrible and strange
			sin: it thrilled him to think of it in the silence when the pens
			scraped lightly. But to drink the altar wine out of the press
			and be found out by the smell was a sin too: but it was not
			terrible and strange. It only made you feel a little sickish on
			account of the smell of the wine. Because on the day when he
			had made his first holy communion in  the chapel he had shut
			his eyes and opened his mouth and put out his tongue a little:
			and when the rector had stooped down to give him the holy
			communion he had smelt a faint winy smell off the rector's
			breath after the wine of the mass. The word was beautiful:
			wine. It made you think of dark purple because the grapes
			were dark purple that grew in Greece outside houses like
			white temples. But the faint smell off the rector's breath had
			made him feel a sick feeling on the morning of his first communion.
			The day of your first communion was the happiest
			day of your life. And once a lot of generals had asked Napoleon
			what was the happiest day of his life. They thought he
			would say the day he won some great battle or the day he was
			made an emperor. But he said: </p>
		<p><said who="Napoleon">—Gentlemen, the happiest day of my life was the day on
				which I made my first holy communion. </said></p>
		<p>Father Arnall came in and the Latin lesson began and he
			remained still, leaning on the desk with his arms folded. Father
			Arnall gave out the themebooks and he said that they
			were scandalous and that they were all to be written out again
			with the corrections at once. But the worst of all was Fleming's
			theme because the pages were stuck together by a blot:
			and Father Arnall held it up by a corner and said it was an
			insult to any master to send him up such a theme. Then he
			asked Jack Lawton to decline the noun <emph>mare</emph> and Jack Lawton
			stopped at the ablative singular and could not go on with the
			plural. </p>
		<p><said who="Father Arnall">—You should be ashamed of yourself, said Father Arnall
				sternly. You, the leader of the class! </said></p>
		<p>Then he asked the next boy and the next and the next.
			Nobody knew. Father Arnall became very quiet, more and
			more quiet as each boy tried to answer and could not. But his
			face was blacklooking and his eyes were staring though his
			voice was so quiet. Then he asked Fleming and Fleming said
			that that word had no plural. Father Arnall suddenly shut the
			book and shouted at him: </p>
		<p><said who="Father Arnall">—Kneel out there in the middle of the class. You are one of
			the idlest boys I ever met. Copy out your themes again the rest
			of you. </said></p>
		<p>Fleming moved heavily out of his place and knelt between
			the two last benches. The others boys bent over their theme-books
			and began to write. A silence filled the classroom and
			Stephen, glancing timidly at Father Arnall's dark face, saw that
			it was a little red from the wax he was in. </p>
		<p>Was that a sin for Father Arnall to be in a wax or was he
			allowed to get into a wax when the boys were idle because that
			made them study better or was he only letting on to be in a
			wax? It was because he was allowed because a priest would
			know what a sin was and would not do it. But if he did it one
			time by mistake what would he do to go to confession? Perhaps
			he would go to confession to the minister. And if the
			minister did it he would go to the rector: and the rector to the
			provincial: and the provincial to the general of the jesuits.
			That was called the order: and he had heard his father say
			that they were all clever men. They could all have become
			highup people in the world if they had not become jesuits.
			And he wondered what Father Arnall and Paddy Barrett
			would have become and what Mr McGlade and Mr Gleeson
			would have become if they had not become jesuits. It was hard
			to think what because you would have to think of them in a
			different way with different coloured coats and trousers and
			with beards and moustaches and different kinds of hats. </p>
		<p>The door opened quietly and closed. A quick whisper ran
			through the class: the prefect of studies. There was an instant
			of dead silence and then the loud crack of a pandybat on the
			last desk. Stephen's heart leapt up in fear. </p>
		<p><said who="Father Dolan">—Any boys want flogging here, Father Arnall? cried the
			prefect of studies. Any lazy idle loafers that want flogging in
			this class? </said></p>
		<p>He came to the middle of the class and saw Fleming on his
			knees. </p>
		<p><said who="Father Dolan">—Hoho! he cried. Who is this boy? Why is he on his knees?
				What is your name, boy? </said></p>
		<p><said who="Fleming">—Fleming, sir. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Father Dolan">—Hoho, Fleming! An idler of course. I can see it in your
				eye. Why is he on his knees, Father Arnall? </said></p>
		<p><said who="Father Arnall">—He wrote a bad Latin theme, Father Arnall said, and he
				missed all the questions in grammar. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Father Dolan">—Of course he did! cried the prefect of studies. Of course
				he did! A born idler! I can see it in the corner of his eye. </said></p>
		<p>He banged his pandybat down on the desk and cried: </p>
		<p><said who="Father Dolan">—Up, Fleming! Up, my boy! </said></p>
		<p>Fleming stood up slowly. </p>
		<p><said who="Father Dolan">—Hold out! cried the prefect of studies. </said></p>
		<p>Fleming held out his hand. The pandybat came down on it
			with a loud smacking sound: one, two, three, four, five, six. </p>
		<p><said who="Father Dolan">—Other hand! </said></p>
		<p>The pandybat came down again in six loud quick smacks. </p>
		<p><said who="Father Dolan">—Kneel down! cried the prefect of studies. </said></p>
		<p>Fleming knelt down squeezing his hands under his armpits,
			his face contorted with pain, but Stephen knew how hard his
			hands were because Fleming was always rubbing rosin into
			them. But perhaps he was in great pain for the noise of the
			pandies was terrible. Stephen's heart was beating and fluttering. </p>
		<p><said who="Father Dolan">—At your work, all of you! shouted the prefect of studies.
			We want no lazy idle loafers here, lazy idle little schemers. At
			your work, I tell you. Father Dolan will be in to see you every
			day. Father Dolan will be in tomorrow. </said></p>
		<p>He poked one of the boys in the side with the pandybat,
			saying: </p>
		<p><said who="Father Dolan">—You, boy! When will Father Dolan be in again? </said></p>
		<p><said who="Tom Furlong">—Tomorrow, sir, said Tom Furlong's voice. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Father Dolan">—Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow, said the prefect
			of studies. Make up your minds for that. Every day Father
			Dolan. Write away. You, boy, who are you? </said></p>
		<p>Stephen's heart jumped suddenly. </p>
		<p><said who="Stephen">—Dedalus, sir. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Father Dolan">—Why are you not writing like the others? </said></p>
		<p><said who="Stephen">—I ... my ... </said></p>
		<p>He could not speak with fright. </p>
		<p><said who="Father Dolan">—Why is he not writing, Father Arnall? </said></p>
		<p><said who="Father Arnall">—He broke his glasses, said Father Arnall, and I exempted
				him from work. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Father Dolan">—Broke? What is this I hear? What is this your name is?
				said the prefect of studies. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Stephen">—Dedalus, sir. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Father Dolan">—Out here, Dedalus. Lazy little schemer. I see schemer in
				your face. Where did you break your glasses? </said></p>
		<p>Stephen stumbled into the middle of the class, blinded by
			fear and haste. </p>
		<p><said who="Father Dolan">—Where did you break your glasses? repeated the prefect
				of studies. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Stephen">—The cinderpath, sir. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Father Dolan">—Hoho! The cinderpath! cried the prefect of studies. I
				know that trick. </said></p>
		<p>Stephen lifted his eyes in wonder and saw for a moment
			Father Dolan's whitegrey not young face, his baldy whitegrey
			head with fluff at the sides of it, the steel rims of his spectacles
			and his nocoloured eyes looking through the glasses. Why did
			he say he knew that trick? </p>
		<p><said who="Father Dolan">—Lazy idle little loafer! cried the prefect of studies. Broke
			my glasses! An old schoolboy trick! Out with your hand this
			moment! </said></p>
		<p>Stephen closed his eyes and held out in the air his trembling
			hand with the palm upwards. He felt the prefect of studies
			touch it for a moment at the fingers to straighten it and then
			the swish of the sleeve of the soutane as the pandybat was
			lifted to strike. A hot burning stinging tingling blow like the
			loud crack of a broken stick made his trembling hand crumple
			together like a leaf in the fire: and at the sound and the pain
			scalding tears were driven into his eyes. His whole body was
			shaking with fright, his arm was shaking and his crumpled
			burning livid hand shook like a loose leaf in the air. A cry
			sprang to his lips, a prayer to be let off. But though the tears
			scalded his eyes and his limbs quivered with pain and fright he
			held back the hot tears and the cry that scalded his throat. </p>
		<p><said who="Father Dolan">—Other hand! shouted the prefect of studies. </said></p>
		<p>Stephen drew back his maimed and quivering right arm and
			held out his left hand. The soutane sleeve swished again as the
			pandybat was lifted and a loud crashing sound and a fierce
			maddening tingling burning pain made his hand shrink together
			with the palms and fingers in a livid quivering mass.
			The scalding water burst forth from his eyes and, burning with
			shame and agony and fear, he drew back his shaking arm in
			terror and burst out into a whine of pain. His body shook with
			a palsy of fright and in shame and rage he felt the scalding cry
			come from his throat and the scalding tears falling out of his
			eyes and down his flaming cheeks. </p>
		<p><said who="Father Dolan">—Kneel down! cried the prefect of studies. </said></p>
		<p>Stephen knelt down quickly pressing his beaten hands to his
			sides. To think of them  beaten and swollen with pain all in a
			moment made him feel so sorry for them as if they were not
			his own but someone else's that he felt sorry for. And as he
			knelt, calming the last sobs in his throat and feeling the burning
			tingling pain pressed in to his sides, he thought of the
			hands which he had held out in the air with the palms up and
			of the firm touch of the prefect of studies when he had steadied
			the shaking fingers and of the beaten swollen reddened
			mass of palm and fingers that shook helplessly  in the air. </p>
		<p><said who="Father Dolan">—Get at your work, all of you, cried the prefect of studies
			from the door. Father Dolan will be in every day to see if any
			boy, any lazy idle little loafer wants flogging. Every day.
			Every day. </said></p>
		<p>The door closed behind him. </p>
		<p>The hushed class continued to copy out the themes. Father
			Arnall rose from his seat and went among them, helping the
			boys with gentle words and telling them the mistakes they had
			made. His voice was very gentle and soft. Then he returned to
			his seat and said to Fleming and Stephen: </p>
		<p><said who="Father Arnall">—You may return to your places, you two. </said></p>
		<p>Fleming and Stephen rose and, walking to their seats, sat
			down. Stephen, scarlet with shame, opened a book quickly
			with one weak hand and bent down upon it, his face close to
			the page. </p>
		<p>It was unfair and cruel because the doctor had told him not
			to read without glasses and he had written home to his father
			that morning to send him a new pair. And Father Arnall had
			said that he need not study till the new glasses came. Then to
			be called a schemer before the class and to be pandied when
			he always got the card for first or second and was the leader of
			the Yorkists! How could the prefect of studies know that it
			was a trick? He felt the touch of the prefect's fingers as they
			had steadied his hand and at first he had thought he was going
			to shake hands with him because the fingers were soft and
			firm: but then in an instant he had heard the swish of the
			soutane sleeve and the crash. It was cruel and unfair to make
			him kneel in the middle of the class then: and Father Arnall
			had told them both that they might return to their places
			without making any difference between them. He listened to
			Father Arnall's low and gentle voice as he corrected the
			themes. Perhaps he was sorry now and wanted to be decent.
			But it was unfair and cruel. The prefect of studies was a priest
			but that was cruel and unfair. And his whitegrey face and the
			nocoloured eyes behind the steelrimmed spectacles were
			cruel looking because he had steadied the hand first with his
			firm soft fingers and that was to hit it better and louder. </p>
		<p><said who="Fleming">—It's a stinking mean thing, that's what it is, said Fleming
			in the corridor as the classes were passing out in file to the
			refectory, to pandy a fellow for what is not his fault. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Nasty Roche">—You really broke your glasses by accident, didn't you?
			Nasty Roche asked. </said></p>
		<p>Stephen felt his heart filled by Fleming's words and did not
			answer. </p>
		<p><said who="Fleming">—Of course he did! said Fleming. I wouldn't stand it. I'd go
				up and tell the rector on him. </said></p>
			<p><said who="Cecil Thunder">—Yes, said Cecil Thunder eagerly, and I saw him lift the
				pandybat over his shoulder and he's not allowed to do that. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Nasty Roche">—Did they hurt much? Nasty Roche asked. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Stephen">—Very much, Stephen said. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Fleming">—I wouldn't stand it, Fleming repeated, from Baldyhead or
			any other Baldyhead. It's a stinking mean low trick, that's
			what it is. I'd go straight up to the rector and tell him about it
			after dinner. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Cecil Thunder">—Yes, do. Yes, do, said Cecil Thunder. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Nasty Roche">—Yes, do. Yes, go up and tell the rector on him, Dedalus,
			said Nasty Roche, because he said that he'd come in tomorrow
			again to pandy you. </said></p>
	<p><said who="all">—Yes, yes. Tell the rector, all said. </said></p>
		<p>And there were some fellows out of second of grammar
			listening and one of them said: </p>
		<p><said who="some fellows out of second of grammar">—The senate and the Roman people declared that Dedalus
				had been wrongly punished. </said></p>
		<p>It was wrong; it was unfair and cruel: and, as he sat in the
			refectory, he suffered time after time in memory the same
			humiliation until he began to wonder whether it might not
			really be that there was something in his face which made him
			look like a schemer and he wished he had a little mirror to see.
			But there could not be; and it was unjust and cruel and unfair. </p>
		<p>He could not eat the blackish fish fritters they got on
			Wednesdays in Lent and one of his potatoes had the mark of
			the spade in it. Yes, he would do what the fellows had told
			him. He would go up and tell the rector that he had been
			wrongly punished. A thing like that had been done before by
			somebody in history, by some great person whose head was in
			the books of history. And the rector would declare that he had
			been wrongly punished because the senate and the Roman
			people always declared that the men who did that had been
			wrongly punished. Those were the great men whose names
			were in Richmal Magnall's Questions. History was all about
			those men and what they did and that was what Peter Parley's
			Tales about Greece and Rome were all about. Peter Parley
			himself was on the first page in a picture. There was a road
			over a heath with grass at the side and little bushes: and Peter
			Parley had a broad hat like a protestant minister and a big
			stick and he was walking fast along the road to Greece and
			Rome. </p>
		<p>It was easy what he had to do. All he had to do  was when
			the dinner was over and he came out in his turn to go on
			walking but not out to the corridor but up the staircase on the
			right that led to the castle. He had nothing to do but that: to
			turn to the right and walk fast up the staircase and in half a
			minute he would be in the low dark narrow corridor that led
			through the castle to the rector's room. And every fellow
			had said that it was unfair, even the fellow out of second of
			grammar who had said that about the senate and the Roman
			people. </p>
		<p>What would happen? He heard the fellows of the higher
			line stand up at the top of the refectory and heard their steps
			as they came down the matting: Paddy Rath and Jimmy
			Magee and the Spaniard and the Portuguese and the fifth was
			big Corrigan who was going to be flogged by Mr Gleeson.
			That was why the prefect of studies had called him a schemer
			and pandied him for nothing: and, straining his weak eyes,
			tired with the tears, he watched big Corrigan's broad shoulders
			and big hanging black head passing in the file. But he had
			done something and besides Mr Gleeson would not flog him
			hard: and he remembered how big Corrigan looked in the
			bath. He had skin the same colour as the turfcoloured bogwater
			in the shallow end of the bath and when he walked
			along the side his feet slapped loudly on the wet tiles and at
			every step his thighs  shook a little because he was fat. </p>
		<p>The refectory was half empty and the fellows were still
			passing out in file. He could go up the staircase because there
			was never a priest or a prefect outside the refectory door. But
			he could not go. The rector would side with the prefect of
			studies and think it was a schoolboy trick and then the prefect
			of studies would come in every day the same only it would be
			worse because he would be dreadfully waxy at any fellow
			going up to the rector about him. The fellows had told him to
			go but they would not go themselves. They had forgotten all
			about it. No, it was best to forget all about it and perhaps the
			prefect of studies had only said he would come in. No, it was
			best to hide out of the way because when you were small and
			young you could often escape that way. </p>
		<p>The fellows at his table stood up. He stood up and passed
			out among them in the file. He had to decide. He was coming
			near the door. If he went on with the fellows he could never go
			up to the rector because he could not leave the playground for
			that. And if he went and was pandied all the same all the
			fellows would make fun and talk about young Dedalus going
			up to the rector to tell on the prefect of studies. </p>
		<p>He was walking down along the matting and he saw the
			door before him. It was impossible: he could not. He thought
			of the baldy head of the prefect of studies with the cruel
			nocoloured eyes looking at him and he heard the voice of the
			prefect of studies asking him twice what his name was. Why
			could he not remember the name when he was told the first
			time? Was he not listening the first time or was it to make fun
			out of the name? The great men in the history had names like
			that and nobody made fun of them. It was his own name that
			he should have made fun of if he wanted to make fun. Dolan:
			it was like the name of a woman that washed clothes. </p>
		<p>He had reached the door and, turning quickly up to the
			right, walked up the stairs and, before he could make up his
			mind to come back, he had entered the low dark narrow
			corridor that led to the castle. And as he crossed the threshold
			of the door of the corridor  he saw, without turning his head to
			look, that all the fellows were looking after him as they went
			filing by. </p>
		<p>He passed along the narrow dark corridor, passing little
			doors that were the doors of the rooms of the community. He
			peered in front of him and right and left through the gloom
			and thought that those must be portraits. It was dark and
			silent and his eyes were weak and tired with tears so that he
			could not see. But he thought they were the portraits of the
			saints and great men of the order who were looking down on
			him silently as he passed: saint Ignatius Loyola holding an
			open book and pointing to the words <seg xml:lang="la">Ad Majorem Dei
			Gloriam</seg> in it, saint Francis Xavier pointing to his chest,
			Lorenzo Ricci with his berretta on his head like one of the
			prefects of the lines, the three patrons of holy youth, saint
			Stanislaus Kostka, saint Aloysius Gonzaga and blessed John
			Berchmans, all with young faces because they died when they
			were young, and Father Peter Kenny sitting in a chair wrapped
			in a big cloak. </p>
		<p>He came out on the landing above the entrance hall and
			looked about him. That was where Hamilton Rowan had
			passed and the marks of the soldiers' slugs were there. And it
			was there that the old servants had seen the ghost in the white
			cloak of a marshal. </p>
		<p>An old servant was sweeping at the end of the landing. He
			asked him where was the rector's room and the old servant
			pointed to the door at the far end and looked after him as he
			went on to it and knocked. </p>
		<p>There was no answer. He knocked again more loudly and
			his heart jumped when he heard a muffled voice say: </p>
		<p><said who="the rector">—Come in! </said></p>
		<p>He turned the handle and opened the door and fumbled for
			the handle of the green baize door inside. He found it and
			pushed it open and went in. </p>
		<p>He saw the rector sitting at a desk writing. There was a
			skull on the desk and a strange solemn smell in the room like
			the old leather of chairs. </p>
		<p>His heart was beating fast on account of the solemn place
			he was in and the silence of the room:  and he looked at the
			skull and at the rector's kindlooking face. </p>
		<p><said who="the rector">—Well, my little man, said the rector, what is it? </said></p>
		<p>Stephen swallowed down the thing in his throat and said: </p>
		<p><said who="Stephen">—I broke my glasses, sir. </said></p>
		<p>The rector opened his mouth and said: </p>
		<p><said who="the rector">—O! </said></p>
		<p>Then he smiled and said: </p>
		<p><said who="the rector">—Well, if we broke our glasses we must write home for a
				new pair. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Stephen">—I wrote home, sir, said Stephen, and Father Arnall said I
				am not to study till they come. </said></p>
		<p><said who="the rector">—Quite right! said the rector. </said></p>
		<p>Stephen swallowed down the thing again  and tried to keep
			his legs and his voice from shaking. </p>
		<p><said who="Stephen">—But, sir ... </said></p>
		<p><said who="the rector">—Yes? </said></p>
		<p><said who="Stephen">—Father Dolan came in today and pandied me because I
				was not writing my theme. </said></p>
		<p>The rector looked at him in silence and he could feel the
			blood rising to his face and the tears about to rise to his eyes. </p>
		<p>The rector said: </p>
		<p><said who="the rector">—Your name is Dedalus, isn't it? </said></p>
		<p><said who="Stephen">—Yes, sir. </said></p>
		<p><said who="the rector">—And where did you break your glasses? </said></p>
		<p><said who="Stephen">—On the cinderpath, sir. A fellow was coming out of the
			bicycle house and I fell and they got broken. I don't know the
			fellow's name. </said></p>
		<p>The rector looked at him again in silence. Then he smiled
			and said: </p>
		<p><said who="the rector">—O, well, it was a mistake; I am sure Father Dolan did not
				know. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Stephen">—But I told him I broke them, sir, and he pandied me. </said></p>
		<p><said who="the rector">—Did you tell him that you had written home for a new
				pair? the rector asked. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Stephen">—No, sir. </said></p>
		<p><said who="the rector">—O well then, said the rector, Father Dolan did not understand.
			You can say that I excuse you from your lessons for a
			few days. </said></p>
		<p>Stephen said quickly for fear his trembling would prevent
			him: </p>
		<p><said who="Stephen">—Yes, sir, but Father Dolan said he will come in tomorrow
				to pandy me again for it. </said></p>
		<p><said who="the rector">—Very well, the rector said, it is a mistake and I shall
				speak to Father Dolan myself. Will that do now? </said></p>
		<p>Stephen felt the tears wetting his eyes and murmured: </p>
		<p><said who="Stephen">—O yes sir, thanks. </said></p>
		<p>The rector held his hand across the side of the desk where
			the skull was and Stephen, placing his hand in it for a moment,
			felt a cool moist palm. </p>
		<p><said who="the rector">—Good day now, said the rector, withdrawing his hand and
				bowing. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Stephen">—Good day, sir, said Stephen. </said></p>
		<p>He bowed and walked quietly out of the room, closing the
			doors carefully and slowly. </p>
		<p>But when he had passed the old servant on the landing and
			was again in the low narrow dark corridor he began to walk
			faster and faster. Faster and faster he hurried on through the
			gloom excitedly. He bumped his elbow against the door at the
			end and, hurrying down the staircase, walked quickly through
			the two corridors and out into the air. </p>
		<p>He could hear the cries of the fellows on the playgrounds.
			He broke into a run and, running quicker and quicker, ran
			across the cinderpath and reached the third line playground,
			panting. </p>
		<p>The fellows had seen him running. They closed round him
			in a ring, pushing one against another to hear. </p>
		<p><said who="the fellows">—Tell us! Tell us! </said></p>
		<p><said who="the fellows">—What did he say? </said></p>
		<p><said who="the fellows">—Did you go in? </said></p>
		<p><said who="the fellows">—What did he say? </said></p>
		<p><said who="the fellows">—Tell us! Tell us! </said></p>
		<p>He told them what he had said and what the rector had said
			and, when he had told them, all the fellows flung their caps
			spinning up into the air and cried: </p>
		<p><said who="the fellows">—Hurroo! </said></p>
		<p>They caught their caps and sent them up again spinning
			skyhigh and cried again: </p>
		<p><said who="the fellows">—Hurroo! Hurroo! </said></p>
		<p>They made a cradle of their locked hands and hoisted him
			up among them and carried him along till he struggled to get
			free. And when he had escaped from them they broke away in
			all directions, flinging their caps again into the air and whistling
			as they went spinning up and crying: </p>
		<p><said who="the fellows">—Hurroo! </said></p>
		<p>And they gave three groans for Baldyhead Dolan and three
			cheers for Conmee and they said he was the decentest rector
			that was ever in Clongowes. </p>
		<p>The cheers died away in the soft grey air. He was alone. He
			was happy and free: but he would not be anyway proud with
			Father Dolan. He would be very quiet and obedient: and he
			wished that he could do something kind for him to show him
			that he was not proud. </p>
		<p>The air was soft and grey and mild and evening was coming.
			There was the smell of evening in the air, the smell of the
			fields in the country where they digged up turnips to peel them
			and eat them when they went out for a walk to Major Barton's,
			the smell there was in the little wood beyond the pavilion
			where the gallnuts were. </p>
		<p>The fellows were practising long shies and bowing lobs and
			slow twisters. In the soft grey silence he could hear the bump
			of the balls: and from here and from there through the quiet
			air the sound of the cricket bats: pick, pack, pock, puck: like
			drops of water in a fountain falling softly in the brimming
			bowl. </p>

		<p>Uncle Charles smoked such black twist that at last his
			nephew suggested to him to enjoy his morning smoke in
			a little outhouse at the end of the garden. </p>
		<p>—Very good, Simon. All serene, Simon, said the old man
			tranquilly. Anywhere you like. The outhouse will do me
			nicely: it will be more salubrious. </p>
		<p>—Damn me, said Mr Dedalus frankly, if I know how you
			can smoke such villainous awful tobacco. It's like gunpowder,
			by God. </p>
		<p>—It's very nice, Simon, replied the old man. Very cool and
			mollifying. </p>
		<p>Every morning, therefore, uncle Charles repaired to his
			outhouse but not before he had creased and brushed scrupulously
			his back hair and brushed and put on his tall hat. While
			he smoked the brim of his tall hat and the bowl of his pipe
			were just visible beyond the jambs of the outhouse door. His
			arbour, as he called the reeking outhouse which he shared
			with the cat and the garden tools, served him also as a soundingbox:
			and every morning he hummed contentedly one of his
			favourite songs: <emph>O, twine me a bower</emph> or <emph>Blue eyes and golden
				hair</emph> or <emph>The Groves of Blarney</emph> while the grey and blue coils of
			smoke rose slowly from his pipe and vanished in the pure air. </p>
		<p>During the first part of the summer in Blackrock uncle
			Charles was Stephen's constant companion. Uncle Charles
			was a hale old man with a welltanned skin, rugged features
			and white side whiskers. On week days he did messages between
			the house in Carysfort Avenue and those shops in the
			main street of the town with which the family dealt. Stephen
			was glad to go with him on these errands for uncle Charles
			helped him very liberally to handfuls of whatever was exposed
			in open boxes and barrels outside the counter. He
			would seize a handful of grapes and sawdust or three or four
			American apples and thrust them generously into his grandnephew's
			hand while the shopman smiled uneasily; and, on
			Stephen's feigning reluctance to take them, he would frown
			and say: </p>
		<p>—Take them, sir. Do you hear me, sir? They're good for
			your bowels. </p>
		<p>When the order list had been booked the two would go on
			to the park where an old friend of Stephen's father, Mike
			Flynn, would be found seated on a bench, waiting for them.
			Then would begin Stephen's run round the park. Mike Flynn
			would stand at the gate near the railway station, watch in
			hand, while Stephen ran round the track in the style Mike
			Flynn favoured, his head high lifted, his knees well lifted and
			his hands held straight down by his sides. When the morning
			practice was over the trainer would make his comments and
			sometimes illustrate them by shuffling along for a yard or so
			comically in an old pair of blue canvas shoes. A small ring of
			wonderstruck children and nursemaids would gather to watch
			him and linger even when he and uncle Charles had sat down
			again and were talking athletics and politics. Though he had
			heard his father say that Mike Flynn had put some of the best
			runners of modern times through his hands Stephen often
			glanced with mistrust at his trainer's flabby stubblecovered
			face, as it bent over the long stained fingers through which he
			rolled his cigarette, and with pity at the mild lustreless blue
			eyes which would look up suddenly from the task and gaze
			vaguely into the blue distance while the long swollen fingers
			ceased their rolling and grains and fibres of tobacco fell back
			into the pouch. </p>
		<p>On the way home uncle Charles would often pay a visit to
			the chapel and, as the font was above Stephen's reach, the old
			man would dip his hand and then sprinkle the water briskly
			about Stephen's clothes and on the floor of the porch. While
			he prayed he knelt on his red handkerchief and read above his
			breath from a thumbblackened prayerbook wherein catchwords
			were printed at the foot of every page. Stephen knelt at
			his side respecting, though he did not share, his piety. He
			often wondered what his granduncle prayed for so seriously.
			Perhaps he prayed for the souls in purgatory or for the grace
			of a happy death or perhaps he prayed that God might send
			him back a part of the big fortune he had squandered in Cork. </p>
		<p>On Sundays Stephen with his father and his granduncle
			took their constitutional. The old man was a nimble walker in
			spite of his corns and often ten or twelve miles of the road
			were covered. The little village of Stillorgan was the parting of
			the ways. Either they went to the left towards the Dublin
			mountains or along the Goatstown road and thence into
			Dundrum, coming home by Sandyford. Trudging along the
			road or standing in some grimy wayside publichouse his elders
			spoke constantly of the subjects nearer their hearts, of Irish
			politics, of Munster and of the legends of their own family, to
			all of which Stephen lent an avid ear. Words which he did not
			understand he said over and over to himself till he had learned
			them by heart: and through them he had glimpses of the real
			world about him. The hour when he too would take part in the
			life of that world seemed drawing near and in secret he began
			to make ready for the great part which he felt awaited him the
			nature of which he only dimly apprehended. </p>
		<p>His evenings were his own; and he pored over a ragged
			translation of <emph>The Count of Monte Cristo</emph>. The figure of that
			dark avenger stood forth in his mind for whatever he had
			heard or divined in childhood of the strange and terrible. At
			night he built up on the parlour table an image of the wonderful
			island cave out of transfers and paper flowers and coloured
			tissue paper and strips of the silver and golden paper in which
			chocolate is wrapped. When he had broken up this scenery,
			weary of its tinsel, there would come to his mind the bright
			picture of Marseilles, of sunny trellisses and of Mercedes.
			Outside Blackrock, on the road that led to the mountains,
			stood a small whitewashed house in the garden of which grew
			many rosebushes: and in this house, he told himself, another
			Mercedes lived. Both on the outward and on the homeward
			journey he measured distance by this landmark: and in his
			imagination he lived through a long train of adventures, marvellous
			as those in the book itself, towards the close of which
			there appeared an image of himself, grown older and sadder,
			standing in a moonlit garden with Mercedes who had so many
			years before slighted his love, and with a sadly proud gesture
			of refusal, saying: </p>
		<p>—Madam, I never eat muscatel grapes. </p>
		<p>He became the ally of a boy named Aubrey Mills and
			founded with him a gang of adventurers in the avenue. Aubrey
			carried a whistle dangling from his buttonhole and a bicycle
			lamp attached to his belt while the others had short sticks
			thrust daggerwise through theirs. Stephen, who had read of
			Napoleon's plain style of dress, chose to remain unadorned
			and thereby heightened for himself the pleasure of taking
			counsel with his lieutenant before giving orders. The gang
			made forays into the gardens of old maids or went down to the
			castle and fought a battle on the shaggy weedgrown rocks,
			coming home after it weary stragglers with the stale odours of
			the foreshore in their nostrils and the rank oils of the seawrack
			upon their hands and in their hair. </p>
		<p>Aubrey and Stephen had a common milkman and often
			they drove out in the milkcar to Carrickmines where the cows
			were at grass. While the men were milking the boys would
			take turns in riding the tractable mare round the field. But
			when autumn came the cows were driven home from the
			grass: and the first sight of the filthy cowyard at Stradbrook
			with its foul green puddles and clots of liquid dung and steaming
			brantroughs sickened Stephen's heart. The cattle which
			had seemed so beautiful in the country on sunny days revolted
			him and he could not even look at the milk they yielded. </p>
		<p>The coming of September did not trouble him this year for
			he was not to be sent back to Clongowes. The practice in the
			park came to an end when Mike Flynn went into hospital.
			Aubrey was at school and had only an hour or two free in the
			evening. The gang fell asunder and there were no more nightly
			forays or battles on the rocks. Stephen sometimes went round
			with the car which delivered the evening milk: and these chilly
			drives blew away his memory of the filth of the cowyard and
			he felt no repugnance at seeing the cowhairs and hayseeds on
			the milkman's coat. Whenever the car drew up before a house
			he waited to catch a glimpse of a wellscrubbed kitchen or of a
			softlylighted hall and to see how the servant would hold the
			jug and how she would close the door. He thought it should be
			a pleasant life enough, driving along the roads every evening
			to deliver milk, if he had warm gloves and a fat bag of gingernuts
			in his pocket to eat from. But the same foreknowledge
			which had sickened his heart and made his legs sag suddenly
			as he raced round the park, the same intuition which had
			made him glance with mistrust at his trainer's flabby stubblecovered
			face as it bent heavily over his long stained fingers,
			dissipated any vision of the future. In a vague way he understood
			that his father was in trouble and that this was the
			reason why he himself had not been sent back to Clongowes.
			For some time he had felt the slight changes in his house; and
			these changes in what he had deemed unchangeable were so
			many slight shocks to his boyish conception of the world. The
			ambition which he felt astir at times in the darkness of his soul
			sought no outlet. A dusk like that of the outer world obscured
			his mind as he heard the mare's hoofs clattering along the
			tramtrack on the Rock Road and the great can swaying and
			rattling behind him. </p>
		<p>He returned to Mercedes and, as he brooded upon her
			image, a strange unrest crept into his blood. Sometimes a fever
			gathered within him and led him to rove alone in the evening
			along the quiet avenue. The peace of the gardens and the
			kindly lights in the windows poured a tender influence into his
			restless heart. The noise of children at play annoyed him and
			their silly voices made him feel, even more keenly than he had
			felt at Clongowes, that he was different from others. He did
			not want to play. He wanted to meet in the real world the
			unsubstantial image which his soul so constantly beheld. He
			did not know where to seek it or how: but a premonition
			which led him on told him that this image would, without any
			overt act of his, encounter him. They would meet quietly as if
			they had known each other and had made their tryst, perhaps
			at one of the gates or in some more secret place. They would
			be alone, surrounded by darkness and silence: and in that
			moment of supreme tenderness he would be transfigured. He
			would fade into something impalpable under her eyes and
			then in a moment, he would be transfigured. Weakness and
			timidity and inexperience would fall from him in that magic
			moment. </p>

	<div n="2.2" type="section">

		<p>Two great yellow caravans had halted one morning before
			the door and men had come tramping into the house to
			dismantle it. The furniture had been hustled out through the
			front garden which was strewn with wisps of straw and rope
			ends and into the huge vans at the gate. When all had been
			safely stowed the vans had set off noisily down the avenue:
			and from the window of the railway carriage, in which he had
			sat with his redeyed mother, Stephen had seen them lumbering
			heavily along the Merrion Road. </p>
		<p>The parlour fire would not draw that evening and Mr Dedalus
			rested the poker against the bars of the grate to attract
			the flame. Uncle Charles dozed in a corner of the half furnished
			uncarpeted room and near him the family portraits
			leaned against the wall. The lamp on the table shed a weak
			light over the boarded floor, muddied by the feet of the vanmen.
			Stephen sat on a footstool beside his father listening to a
			long and incoherent monologue. He understood little or
			nothing of it at first but he became slowly aware that his father
			had enemies and that some fight was going to take place. He
			felt too that he was being enlisted for the fight, that some duty
			was being laid upon his shoulders. The sudden flight from the
			comfort and revery of Blackrock, the passage through the
			gloomy foggy city, the thought of the bare cheerless house in
			which they were now to live made his heart heavy: and again
			an intuition or foreknowledge of the future came to him. He
			understood also why the servants had often whispered together
			in the hall and why his father had often stood on the
			hearthrug, with his back to the fire, talking loudly to uncle
			Charles who urged him to sit down and eat his dinner. </p>
		<p>—There's a crack of the whip left in me yet, Stephen, old
			chap, said Mr Dedalus, poking at the dull fire with fierce
			energy. We're not dead yet, sonny. No, by the Lord Jesus
			(God forgive me) nor half dead. </p>
		<p>Dublin was a new and complex sensation. Uncle Charles
			had grown so witless that he could no longer be sent out on
			errands and the disorder in settling in the new house left
			Stephen freer than he had been in Blackrock. In the beginning
			he contented himself with circling timidly round the neighbouring
			square or, at most, going half way down one of the
			side streets: but when he had made a skeleton map of the city
			in his mind he followed boldly one of its central lines until he
			reached the customhouse. He passed unchallenged among the
			docks and along the quays wondering at the multitude of
			corks that lay bobbing on the surface of the water in a thick
			yellow scum, at the crowds of quay porters and the rumbling
			carts and the illdressed bearded policeman. The vastness and
			strangeness of the life suggested to him by the bales of merchandise
			stocked along the walls or swung aloft out of the
			holds of steamers wakened again in him the unrest which had
			sent him wandering in the evening from garden to garden in
			search of Mercedes. And amid this new bustling life he might
			have fancied himself in another Marseilles but that he missed
			the bright sky and the sunwarmed trellisses of the wineshops.
			A vague dissatisfaction grew up within him as he looked on the
			quays and on the river and on the lowering skies and yet he
			continued to wander up and down day after day as if he really
			sought someone that eluded him. </p>
		<p>He went once or twice with his mother to visit their relatives:
			and, though they passed a jovial array of shops lit up
			and adorned for Christmas, his mood of embittered silence did
			not leave him. The causes of his embitterment were many,
			remote and near. He was angry with himself for being young
			and the prey of restless foolish impulses, angry also with the
			change of fortune which was reshaping the world about him
			into a vision of squalor and insincerity. Yet his anger lent
			nothing to the vision. He chronicled with patience what he
			saw, detaching himself from it and testing its mortifying
			flavour in secret. </p>
		<p>He was sitting on the backless chair in his aunt's kitchen. A
			lamp with a reflector hung on the japanned wall of the fireplace
			and by its light his aunt was reading the evening paper
			that lay on her knees. She looked a long time at a smiling
			picture that was set in it and said musingly: </p>
		<p>—The beautiful Mabel Hunter! </p>
		<p>A ringletted girl stood on tiptoe to peer at the picture and
			said softly: </p>
		<p>—What is she in, mud? </p>
		<p>—In the pantomime, love. </p>
		<p>The child leaned her ringletted head against her mother's
			sleeve, gazing on the picture, and murmured as if fascinated: </p>
		<p>—The beautiful Mabel Hunter! </p>
		<p>As if fascinated, her eyes rested long upon those demurely
			taunting eyes and she murmured again devotedly: </p>
		<p>—Isn't she an exquisite creature? </p>
		<p>And the boy who came in from the street, stamping
			crookedly under his stone of coal, heard her words. He
			dropped his load promptly on the floor and hurried to her side
			to see. But she did not raise her easeful head to let him see. He
			mauled the edges of the paper with his reddened and blackened
			hands, shouldering her aside and complaining that he
			could not see. </p>
		<p>He was sitting in the narrow breakfast room high up in the
			old darkwindowed house. The firelight flickered on the wall
			and beyond the window a spectral dusk was gathering upon
			the river. Before the fire an old woman was busy making tea
			and, as she bustled at her task, she told in a low voice of what
			the priest and the doctor had said. She told too of certain
			changes she had seen in her of late and of her odd ways and
			sayings. He sat listening to the words and following the ways
			of adventure that lay open in the coals, arches and vaults and
			winding galleries and jagged caverns. </p>
		<p>Suddenly he became aware of something in the doorway. A
			skull appeared suspended in the gloom of the doorway. A
			feeble creature like a monkey was there, drawn thither by the
			sound of voices at the fire. A whining voice came from the
			door, asking: </p>
		<p>—Is that Josephine? </p>
		<p>The old bustling woman answered cheerily from the fireplace: </p>
		<p>—No, Ellen. It's Stephen. </p>
		<p>—O ... O, good evening, Stephen. </p>
		<p>He answered the greeting and saw a silly smile break over
			the face in the doorway. </p>
		<p>—Do you want anything, Ellen? asked the old woman at
			the fire. </p>
		<p>But she did not answer the question and said: </p>
		<p>—I thought it was Josephine. I thought you were Josephine,
			Stephen. </p>
		<p>And, repeating this several times, she fell to laughing feebly. </p>
		<p>He was sitting in the midst of a children's party at Harold's
			Cross. His silent watchful manner had grown upon him and he
			took little part in the games. The children, wearing the spoils
			of their crackers, danced and romped noisily and, though he
			tried to share their merriment, he felt himself a gloomy figure
			amid the gay cocked hats and sunbonnets. </p>
		<p>But when he had sung his song and withdrawn into a snug
			corner of the room he began to taste the joy of his loneliness.
			The mirth, which in the beginning of the evening had seemed
			to him false and trivial, was like a soothing air to him, passing
			gaily by his senses, hiding from other eyes the feverish agitation
			of his blood while through the circling of the dancers and
			amid the music and laughter her glance travelled to his corner,
			flattering, taunting, searching, exciting his heart. </p>
		<p>In the hall the children who had stayed latest were putting
			on their things: the party was over. She had thrown a shawl
			about her and, as they went together towards the tram, sprays
			of her fresh warm breath flew gaily above her cowled head
			and her shoes tapped blithely on the glassy road. </p>
		<p>It was the last tram. The lank brown horses knew it and
			shook their bells to the clear night in admonition. The conductor
			talked with the driver, both nodding often in the green
			light of the lamp. On the empty seats of the tram were scattered
			a few coloured tickets. No sound of footsteps came up
			or down the road. No sound broke the peace of the night save
			when the lank brown horses rubbed their noses together and
			shook their bells. </p>
		<p>They seemed to listen, he on the upper step and she on the
			lower. She came up to his step many times and went down to
			hers again between their phrases and once or twice stood close
			beside him for some moments on the upper step, forgetting to
			go down, and then went down. His heart danced upon her
			movements like a cork upon a tide. He heard what her eyes
			said to him from beneath their cowl and knew that in some
			dim past, whether in life or in revery, he had heard their tale
			before. He saw her urge her vanities, her fine dress and sash
			and long black stockings, and knew that he had yielded to
			them a thousand times. Yet a voice within him spoke above
			the noise of his dancing heart, asking him would he take her
			gift to which he had only to stretch out his hand. And he
			remembered the day when he and Eileen had stood looking
			into the hotel grounds, watching the waiters running up a trail
			of bunting on the flagstaff and the fox terrier scampering to
			and fro on the sunny lawn, and how, all of a sudden, she had
			broken out into a peal of laughter and had run down the
			sloping curve of the path. Now, as then, he stood listlessly in
			his place, seemingly a tranquil watcher of the scene before
			him. </p>
		<p>—She too wants me to catch hold of her, he thought. That's
			why she came with me to the tram. I could easily catch hold of
			her when she comes up to my step: nobody is looking. I could
			hold her and kiss her. </p>
		<p>But he did neither: and, when he was sitting alone in the
			deserted tram, he tore his ticket into shreds and stared
			gloomily at the corrugated footboard. </p>
		<p>The next day he sat at his table in the bare upper room for
			many hours. Before him lay a new pen, a new bottle of ink
			and a new emerald exercise. From force of habit he had
			written at the top of the first page the initial letters of the jesuit
			motto: A. M. D. G. On the first line of the page appeared the
			title of the verses he was trying to write: To E— C—.
			He knew it was right to begin so for he had seen similar titles
			in the collected poems of Lord Byron. When he had written
			this title and drawn an ornamental line underneath he fell into
			a daydream and began to draw diagrams on the cover of the
			book. He saw himself sitting at his table in Bray the morning
			after the discussion at the Christmas dinnertable, trying to
			write a poem about Parnell on the back of one of his father's
			second moiety notices. But his brain had then refused to
			grapple with the theme and, desisting, he had covered the
			page with the names and addresses of certain of his classmates: </p>
		<p>Roderick Kickham </p>
		<p>John Lawton </p>
		<p>Anthony MacSwiney </p>
		<p>Simon Moonan </p>
		<p>Now it seemed as if he would fail again but, by dint of
			brooding on the incident, he thought himself into confidence.
			During this process all these elements which he deemed common
			and insignificant fell out of the scene. There remained no
			trace of the tram itself nor of the trammen nor of the horses:
			nor did he and she appear vividly. The verses told only of the
			night and the balmy breeze and the maiden lustre of the moon.
			Some undefined sorrow was hidden in the hearts of the protagonists
			as they stood in silence beneath the leafless trees and
			when the moment of farewell had come the kiss, which had
			been withheld by one, was given by both. After this the letters
			L. D. S. were written at the foot of the page and, having hidden
			the book, he went into his mother's bedroom and gazed at his
			face for a long time in the mirror of her dressingtable. </p>
		<p>But his long spell of leisure and liberty was drawing to its
			end. One evening his father came home full of news which
			kept his tongue busy all through dinner. Stephen had been
			awaiting his father's return for there had been mutton hash
			that day and he knew that his father would make him dip his
			bread in the gravy. But he did not relish the hash for the
			mention of Clongowes had coated his palate with a scum of
			disgust. </p>
		<p>—I walked bang into him, said Mr Dedalus for the fourth
			time, just at the corner of the square. </p>
		<p>—Then I suppose, said Mrs Dedalus, he will be able to
			arrange it. I mean about Belvedere. </p>
		<p>—Of course  he will, said Mr Dedalus. Don't I tell you he's
			provincial of the order now? </p>
		<p>—I never liked the idea of sending him to the christian
			brothers myself, said Mrs Dedalus. </p>
		<p>—Christian brothers be damned! said Mr Dedalus. Is it
			with Paddy Stink and Mickey Mud? No, let him stick to the
			jesuits in God's name since he began with them. They'll be of
			service to him in after years. Those are the fellows that can get
			you a position. </p>
		<p>—And they're a very rich order, aren't they, Simon? </p>
		<p>—Rather. They live well, I tell you. You saw their table at
			Clongowes. Fed up, by God, like gamecocks. </p>
		<p>Mr Dedalus pushed his plate over to Stephen and bade him
			finish what was on it. </p>
		<p>—Now then, Stephen, he said, you must put your shoulder
			to the wheel, old chap. You've had a fine long holiday. </p>
		<p>—O, I'm sure  he'll work very hard now, said Mrs Dedalus,
			especially when he has Maurice with him. </p>
		<p>—O, Holy Paul, I forgot about Maurice, said Mr Dedalus.
			Here, Maurice! Come here, you thickheaded ruffian! Do you
			know I'm going to send you to a college where they'll teach
			you to spell c.a.t. cat. And I'll buy you a nice little penny
			handkerchief to keep your nose dry. Won't that be grand fun? </p>
		<p>Maurice grinned at his father and then at his brother. Mr
			Dedalus screwed his glass into his eye and stared hard at both
			his sons. Stephen mumbled his bread without answering his
			father's gaze. </p>
		<p>—By the bye, said Mr Dedalus at length, the rector, or
			provincial, rather, was telling me that story about you and
			Father Dolan. You're an impudent thief, he said. </p>
		<p>—O, he didn't, Simon! </p>
		<p>—Not he! said Mr Dedalus. But he gave me a great account
			of the whole affair. We were chatting, you know, and one
			word borrowed another. And, by the way, who do you think
			he told me will get that job in the corporation? But I'll tell you
			that after. Well, as I was saying, we were chatting away quite
			friendly and he asked me did our friend here wear glasses still
			and then he told me the whole story. </p>
		<p>—And was he annoyed, Simon? </p>
		<p>—Annoyed! Not he! <emph>Manly little chap!</emph> he said. </p>
		<p>Mr Dedalus imitated the mincing nasal tone of the provincial. </p>
		<p>—Father Dolan and I, when I told them all at dinner about
			it, Father Dolan and I had a great laugh over it. <emph>You better
				mind yourself, Father Dolan</emph>, said I, <emph>or young Dedalus will
				send you up for twice nine</emph>. We had a famous laugh together
			over it. Ha! Ha! Ha!</p>
		<p>Mr Dedalus turned to his wife and interjected in his natural
			voice: </p>
		<p>—Shows you the spirit in which they take the boys there.
			O, a jesuit for your life, for diplomacy! </p>
		<p>He reassumed the provincial's voice and repeated: </p>
		<p>—<emph>I told them all at dinner about it and Father Dolan and I
				and all of us we had a hearty laugh together over it. Ha! Ha! Ha!</emph></p>

	<div n="2.3" type="section">

		<p>The night of the Whitsuntide play had come and Stephen
			from the window of the dressingroom looked out on  the small
			grassplot across which lines of Chinese lanterns were
			stretched. He watched the visitors come down the steps from
			the house and pass into the theatre. Stewards in evening dress,
			old Belvedereans, loitered in groups about the entrance to the
			theatre and ushered in the visitors with ceremony. Under the
			sudden glow of a lantern he could recognise the smiling face of
			a priest. </p>
		<p>The Blessed Sacrament had been removed from the tabernacle
			and the first benches had been driven so as to leave
			the dais of the altar and the space before it free. Against
			the walls stood companies of barbells and Indian clubs; the
			dumbbells were piled in one corner: and in the midst of countless
			hillocks of gymnasium shoes and sweaters and singlets in
			untidy brown parcels there stood the stout leatherjacketed
			vaulting horse waiting its turn to be carried up on the stage. A
			large bronze shield, tipped with silver, leaned against the panel
			of the altar also waiting its turn to be carried up on the stage
			and set in the middle of the winning team at the end of the
			gymnastic  display. </p>
		<p>Stephen, though in deference to his reputation for essay-writing
			he had been elected secretary to the gymnasium, had
			had no part in the first section of the programme but in the
			play which formed the second section he had the chief part,
			that of a farcical  pedagogue. He had been cast for it on account
			of his stature and grave manners for he was now at the
			end of his second year at Belvedere and in number two. </p>
		<p>A score of the younger boys in white knickers and singlets
			came pattering down from the stage, through the vestry and
			into the chapel. The vestry and chapel were peopled with
			eager masters and boys. The plump bald sergeantmajor was
			testing with his foot the springboard of the vaulting horse. The
			lean young man in a long overcoat, who was to give a special
			display of intricate club swinging, stood near watching with
			interest, his silvercoated clubs peeping out of his deep sidepockets.
			The hollow rattle of the wooden dumbbells was
			heard as another team made ready to go up on the stage: and
			in another moment the excited prefect was hustling the boys
			through the vestry like a flock of geese, flapping the wings of
			his soutane nervously and crying to the laggards to make
			haste. A little troop  of Neapolitan peasants were practising
			their steps at the end of the chapel, some circling their arms
			above their heads, some swaying their baskets of paper violets
			and curtseying. In a dark corner of the chapel at the gospel
			side of the altar a stout old lady knelt amid her copious black
			skirts. When she stood up a pinkdressed figure, wearing a
			curly golden wig and an oldfashioned straw sunbonnet, with
			black pencilled eyebrows and cheeks delicately rouged and
			powdered, was discovered. A low murmur of curiosity ran
			round the chapel at the discovery of this girlish figure. One of
			the prefects, smiling and nodding his head, approached the
			dark corner and, having bowed to the stout old lady, said
			pleasantly: </p>
		<p>—Is this a beautiful young lady or a doll that you have
			here, Mrs Tallon? </p>
		<p>Then, bending down to peer at the smiling painted face
			under the leaf of the bonnet, he exclaimed: </p>
		<p>—No! Upon my word I believe it's little Bertie Tallon after
			all! </p>
		<p>Stephen at his post by the window heard the old lady and
			the priest laugh together and heard the boys' murmur of
			admiration behind him as they passed forward to see the little
			boy who had to dance the sunbonnet dance by himself. A
			movement of impatience escaped him. He let the edge of the
			blind fall and, stepping down from the bench on which he had
			been standing, walked out of the chapel. </p>
		<p>He passed out of the schoolhouse and halted under the shed
			that flanked the garden. From the theatre opposite came the
			muffled noise of the audience and sudden brazen clashes of
			the soldiers' band. The light spread upwards from the glass
			roof making the theatre seem a festive ark, anchored among
			the hulks of houses, her frail cables of lanterns looping her to
			her moorings. A sidedoor of the theatre opened suddenly and
			a shaft of light flew across the grassplots. A sudden burst of
			music issued from the ark, the prelude of a waltz: and when
			the sidedoor closed again the listener could hear the faint
			rhythm of the music. The sentiment of the opening bars, their
			languor and supple movement, evoked the incommunicable
			emotion which had been the cause of all his day's unrest and
			of his impatient movement of a moment before. His unrest
			issued from him like a wave of sound: and on the tide of flowing
			music the ark was journeying, trailing her cables of lanterns
			in her wake. Then a noise like dwarf artillery broke the
			movement. It was the clapping that greeted the entry of the
			dumbbell team on the stage. </p>
		<p>At the far end of the shed near the street a speck of pink
			light showed in the darkness and as he walked towards it he
			became aware of a faint aromatic odour. Two boys were
			standing in the shelter of a doorway, smoking, and before he
			reached them he had recognised Heron by his voice. </p>
		<p>—Here comes the noble Dedalus! cried a high throaty
			voice. Welcome to our trusty friend! </p>
		<p>This welcome ended in a soft peal of mirthless laughter as
			Heron salaamed and then began to poke the ground with his
			cane. </p>
		<p>—Here I am, said Stephen, halting and glancing from
			Heron to his friend. </p>
		<p>The latter was a stranger to him but in the darkness, by the
			aid of the glowing cigarettetips, he could make out a pale
			dandyish face, over which a smile was travelling slowly, a tall
			overcoated figure and a hard hat. Heron did not trouble himself
			about an introduction but said instead: </p>
		<p>—I was just telling my friend Wallis what a lark it would be
			tonight if you took off the rector in the part of the schoolmaster.
			It would be a ripping good joke. </p>
		<p>Heron made a poor attempt to imitate for his friend Wallis
			the rector's pedantic bass and then, laughing at his failure,
			asked Stephen to do it. </p>
		<p>—Go on, Dedalus, he urged, you can take him off rippingly.
			<lg>
				<l>He that will not hear the churcha let him be to theea as</l>
				<l>the heathena and the publicana.</l>
			</lg>
		</p>

		<p>The imitation was prevented by a mild expression of anger
			from Wallis in whose mouthpiece the cigarette had become
			too tightly wedged. </p>
		<p>—Damn this blankety blank holder, he said, taking it from
			his mouth and smiling and frowning upon it tolerantly. It's
			always getting stuck like that. Do you use a holder? </p>
		<p>—I don't smoke, answered Stephen. </p>
		<p>—No, said Heron, Dedalus is a model youth. He doesn't
			smoke and he doesn't go to bazaars and he doesn't flirt and he
			doesn't damn anything or damn all. </p>
		<p>Stephen shook his head and smiled in his rival's flushed and
			mobile face, beaked like a bird's. He had often thought it
			strange that Vincent Heron had a bird's face as well as a bird's
			name. A shock of pale hair lay on the forehead like a ruffled
			crest: the forehead was narrow and bony and a thin hooked
			nose stood out between the closeset prominent eyes which were
			light and inexpressive. The rivals were school friends. They
			sat together in class, knelt together in the chapel, talked together
			after beads over their lunches. As the fellows in number
			one were undistinguished dullards Stephen and Heron had
			been during the year the virtual heads of the school. It was
			they who went up to the rector together to ask for a free day
			or to get a fellow off. </p>
		<p>—O by the way, said Heron suddenly, I saw your governor
			going in. </p>
		<p>The smile waned on Stephen's face. Any allusion made to
			his father by a fellow or by a master put his calm to rout in a
			moment. He waited in timorous silence to hear what Heron
			might say next. Heron, however, nudged him expressively
			with his elbow and said: </p>
		<p>—You're a sly dog, Dedalus! </p>
		<p>—Why so? said Stephen. </p>
		<p>—You'd think butter wouldn't melt in your mouth, said
			Heron. But I'm afraid you're a sly dog. </p>
		<p>—Might I ask you what you are talking about? said
			Stephen urbanely. </p>
		<p>—Indeed you might, answered Heron. We saw her, Wallis,
			didn't we? And deucedly pretty she is too. And so inquisitive!
			<emph>And what part does Stephen take, Mr Dedalus? And will
			Stephen not sing, Mr Dedalus?</emph> Your governor was staring at
			her through that eyeglass of his for all he was worth so that I
			think the old man has found you out too. I wouldn't care a
			bit, by Jove. She's  ripping, isn't she, Wallis? </p>
		<p>—Not half bad, answered Wallis quietly as he placed his
			holder once more in the corner of his mouth. </p>
		<p>A shaft of momentary anger flew through Stephen's mind
			at these indelicate allusions in the hearing of a stranger. For
			him there was nothing amusing in a girl's interest and regard.
			All day he had thought of nothing but their leavetaking on
			the steps of the tram at Harold's Cross, the stream of moody
			emotions it had made to course through him, and the poem
			he had written about it. All day he had imagined a new meeting
			with her for he knew that she was to come to the play. The
			old restless moodiness had again filled his breast as it had
			done on the night of the party but had not found  an outlet in
			verse. The growth and knowledge of two years of boyhood
			stood between then and now, forbidding such an outlet: and
			all day the stream of gloomy tenderness within him had
			started forth and returned upon itself in dark courses and
			eddies, wearying him in the end until the pleasantry of the
			prefect and the painted little boy had drawn from him a
			movement of impatience. </p>
		<p>—So you may as well admit, Heron went on, that we've
			fairly found you out this time. You can't play the saint on me
			any more, that's one sure five. </p>
		<p>A soft peal of mirthless laughter escaped from his lips and,
			bending down as before, he struck Stephen lightly across the
			calf of the leg with his cane, as if in jesting reproof. </p>
		<p>Stephen's movement of anger had already passed. He was
			neither flattered nor confused but simply wished the banter to
			end. He scarcely resented what had seemed to him at first a
			silly indelicateness for he knew that the adventure in his mind
			stood in no danger from their words: and his face mirrored his
			rival's false smile. </p>
		<p>—Admit! repeated Heron, striking him again with his cane
			across the calf of the leg. </p>
		<p>The stroke was playful but not so lightly given as the first
			one had been. Stephen felt the skin tingle and glow slightly
			and almost painlessly; and bowing submissively, as if to meet
			his companion's jesting mood, began to recite the <seg xml:lang="la">Confiteor</seg>.
			The episode ended well for both Heron and Wallis laughed
			indulgently at the irreverence. </p>
		<p>The confession came only from Stephen's lips and, while
			they spoke the words, a sudden memory had carried him to
			another scene called up, as if by magic, at the moment when
			he had noted the faint cruel dimples at the corners of Heron's
			smiling lips and had felt the familiar stroke of the cane against
			his calf and had heard the familiar word of admonition: </p>
		<p>—Admit. </p>
		<p>It was towards the close of his first term in the college when
			he was in number six. His sensitive nature was still smarting
			under the lashes of an undivined and squalid way of life. His
			soul was still disquieted and cast down by the dull phenomenon
			of Dublin. He had emerged from a two years' spell of
			revery to find himself in the midst of a new scene, every event
			and figure of which affected him intimately, disheartened him
			or allured and, whether alluring or disheartening, filled him
			always with unrest and bitter thoughts. All the leisure which
			his school life left him was passed in the company of subversive
			writers whose gibes and violence of speech set up a ferment
			in his brain before they passed out of it into his crude
			writings. </p>
		<p>The essay was for him the chief labour of his week and
			every Tuesday, as he marched from home to the school, he
			read his fate in the incidents of the way, pitting himself against
			some figure ahead of him and quickening his pace to outstrip
			it before a certain goal was reached or planting his steps
			scrupulously in the spaces of the patchwork of the footpath
			and telling himself that he would be first and not first in the
			weekly essay. </p>
		<p>On a certain Tuesday the course of his triumphs was rudely
			broken. Mr Tate, the English master, pointed his finger at him
			and said bluntly: </p>
		<p>—This fellow has heresy in his essay. </p>
		<p>A hush fell on the class. Mr Tate did not break it but dug
			with his hand between his crossed thighs while his heavily
			starched linen creaked about his neck and wrists. Stephen did
			not look up. It was a raw spring morning and his eyes were
			still smarting and weak. He was conscious of failure and of
			detection, of the squalor of his own mind and home, and felt
			against his neck the raw edge of his turned and jagged collar. </p>
		<p>A short loud laugh from Mr Tate set the class more at ease. </p>
		<p>—Perhaps you didn't know that, he said. </p>
		<p>—Where? asked Stephen. </p>
		<p>Mr Tate withdrew his delving hand and spread out the
			essay. </p>
		<p>—Here. It's about the Creator and the soul. Rrm ... rrm
			... rrm ...  Ah! <emph>without a possibility of ever approaching
			nearer</emph>. That's heresy. </p>
		<p>Stephen murmured: </p>
		<p>—I meant <emph>without a possibility of ever reaching</emph>. </p>
		<p>It was a submission and Mr Tate, appeased, folded up the
			essay and passed it across to him, saying: </p>
		<p>—O ... Ah! <emph>ever reaching</emph>. That's another story. </p>
		<p>But the class was not so soon appeased. Though nobody
			spoke to him of the affair after class he could feel about him a
			vague general malignant joy. </p>
		<p>A few nights after this public chiding  he was walking with a
			letter along the Drumcondra Road when he heard a voice cry: </p>
		<p>—Halt! </p>
		<p>He turned and saw three boys of his own class coming
			towards him in the dusk. It was Heron who had called out and,
			as he marched forward between his two attendants, he cleft
			the air before him with a thin cane, in time to their steps.
			Boland, his friend, marched beside him, a large grin on his
			face, while Nash came on a few steps behind, blowing from
			the pace and wagging his great red head. </p>
		<p>As soon as the boys had turned into Clonliffe Road together
			they began to speak about books and writers, saying what
			books they were reading and how many books there were in
			their fathers' bookcases at home. Stephen listened to them in
			some wonderment for Boland was the dunce and Nash the
			idler of the class. In fact after some talk about their favourite
			writers Nash declared for Captain Marryat who, he said, was
			the greatest writer. </p>
		<p>—Fudge! said Heron. Ask Dedalus. Who is the greatest
			writer, Dedalus? </p>
		<p>Stephen noted the mockery in the question and said: </p>
		<p>—Of prose do you mean? </p>
		<p>—Yes. </p>
		<p>—Newman, I think. </p>
		<p>—Is it Cardinal Newman? asked Boland. </p>
		<p>—Yes, answered Stephen. </p>
		<p>The grin broadened on Nash's freckled face as he turned to
			Stephen and said: </p>
		<p>—And do you like Cardinal Newman, Dedalus? </p>
		<p>—O, many say that Newman has the best prose style,
			Heron said to the other two in explanation. Of course he's not
			a poet. </p>
		<p>—And who is the best poet, Heron? asked Boland. </p>
		<p>—Lord Tennyson, of course, answered Heron. </p>
		<p>—O, yes, Lord Tennyson, said Nash. We have all his
			poetry at home in a book. </p>
		<p>At this Stephen forgot the silent vows he had been making
			and burst out: </p>
		<p>—Tennyson a poet! Why, he's only a rhymester! </p>
		<p>—O, get out! said Heron. Everyone knows that Tennyson
			is the greatest poet. </p>
		<p>—And who do you think is the greatest poet? asked Boland,
			nudging his neighbour. </p>
		<p>—Byron, of course, answered Stephen. </p>
		<p>Heron gave the lead and all three joined in a scornful laugh. </p>
		<p>—What are you laughing at? asked Stephen. </p>
		<p>—You, said Heron. Byron the greatest poet! He's only a
			poet for uneducated people. </p>
		<p>—He must be a fine poet! said Boland. </p>
		<p>—You may keep your mouth shut, said Stephen, turning on
			him boldly. All you know about poetry is what you wrote up
			on the slates in the yard and were going to be sent to the loft
			for. </p>
		<p>Boland, in fact, was said to have written on the slates in the
			yard a couplet about a classmate of his who often rode home
			from the college on a pony: </p>
		<lg>
			<l>As Tyson was riding into Jerusalem</l>
			<l>He fell and hurt his Alec Kafoozelum. </l>
		</lg>
		<p>This thrust put the two lieutenants to silence but Heron
			went on: </p>
		<p>—In any case Byron was a heretic and immoral too. </p>
		<p>—I don't care what he was, cried Stephen hotly. </p>
		<p>—You don't care whether he was a heretic or not? said
			Nash. </p>
		<p>—What do you know about it? shouted Stephen. You never
			read a line of anything in your life except a trans or Boland
			either. </p>
		<p>—I know that Byron was a bad man, said Boland. </p>
		<p>—Here, catch hold of this heretic, Heron called out. </p>
		<p>In a moment Stephen was a prisoner. </p>
		<p>—Tate made you buck up the other day, Heron went on,
			about the heresy in your essay. </p>
		<p>—I'll tell him tomorrow, said Boland. </p>
		<p>—Will you? said Stephen. You'd be afraid to open your
			lips. </p>
		<p>—Afraid? </p>
		<p>—Ay. Afraid of your life. </p>
		<p>—Behave yourself! cried Heron, cutting at Stephen's legs
			with his cane. </p>
		<p>It was the signal for their  onset. Nash pinioned his arms
			behind while Boland seized a long cabbage stump which was
			lying in the gutter. Struggling and kicking under the cuts of the
			cane and the blows of the knotty stump Stephen was borne
			back against a barbed wire fence. </p>
		<p>—Admit that Byron was no good. </p>
		<p>—No. </p>
		<p>—Admit. </p>
		<p>—No. </p>
		<p>—Admit. </p>
		<p>—No. No. </p>
		<p>At last after a fury of plunges he wrenched himself free. His
			tormentors set off towards Jones's Road, laughing and jeering
			at him, while he, torn and flushed and panting, stumbled after
			them half blinded with tears, clenching his fists madly and
			sobbing. </p>
		<p>While he was still repeating the <seg xml:lang="la">Confiteor</seg> amid the indulgent
			laughter of his hearers and while the scenes of that malignant
			episode were still passing sharply and swiftly before his
			mind he wondered why he bore no malice now to those who
			had tormented him. He had not forgotten a whit of their
			cowardice and cruelty but the memory of it called forth no
			anger from him. All the descriptions of fierce love and hatred
			which he had met in books had  seemed to him therefore
			unreal. Even that night as he stumbled homewards along
			Jones's Road he had felt that some power was divesting him
			of that suddenwoven anger as easily as a fruit is divested of its
			soft ripe peel. </p>
		<p>He remained standing with his two companions at the end
			of the shed, listening idly to their talk or to the bursts of applause
			in the theatre. She was sitting there among the others
			perhaps waiting for him to appear. He tried to recall her
			appearance but could not. He could remember only that she
			had worn a shawl about her head like a cowl and that her dark
			eyes had invited and unnerved him. He wondered had he been
			in her thoughts as she had been in his. Then in the dark and
			unseen by the other two he rested the tips of the fingers of one
			hand upon the palm of the other hand, scarcely touching it
			and yet pressing upon it lightly. But the pressure of her fingers
			had been lighter and steadier: and suddenly the memory of
			their touch traversed his brain and body like an invisible warm
			wave. </p>
		<p>A boy came towards them, running along under the shed.
			He was excited and breathless. </p>
		<p>—O, Dedalus, he cried, Doyle is in a great bake about
			you. You're to go in at once and get dressed for the play.
			Hurry up, you better. </p>
		<p>—He's coming now, said Heron to the messenger with a
			haughty drawl, when he wants to. </p>
		<p>The boy turned to Heron and repeated: </p>
		<p>—But Doyle is in an awful bake. </p>
		<p>—Will you tell Doyle with my best compliments that I
			damned his eyes? answered Heron. </p>
		<p>—Well, I must go now, said Stephen, who cared little for
			such points of honour. </p>
		<p>—I wouldn't, said Heron, damn me if I would. That's no
			way to send for one of the senior boys. In a bake, indeed! I
			think it's quite enough that you're taking a part in his bally old
			play. </p>
		<p>This spirit of quarrelsome comradeship which he had observed
			lately in his rival had not seduced Stephen from his
			habits of quiet obedience. He mistrusted the turbulence and
			doubted the sincerity of such comradeship which seemed to
			him a sorry anticipation of manhood. The question of honour
			here raised was, like all such questions, trivial to him. While
			his mind had been pursuing its intangible phantoms and
			turning in irresolution from such pursuit he had heard about
			him the constant voices of his father and of his masters, urging
			him to be a gentleman above all things and urging him to be a
			good catholic above all things. These voices had now come to
			be hollowsounding in his ears. When the gymnasium had
			been opened he had heard another voice urging him to be
			strong and manly and healthy and when the movement towards
			national revival had begun to be felt in the college yet
			another voice had bidden him  be true to his country and help
			to raise up her fallen language and tradition. In the profane
			world, as he foresaw, a worldly voice would bid him raise up
			his father's fallen state by his labours and, meanwhile, the
			voice of his school comrades urged him to be a decent fellow,
			to shield others from blame or to beg them off and to do his
			best to get free days for the school. And it was the din of all
			these hollowsounding voices that made him halt irresolutely in
			the pursuit of phantoms. He gave them ear only for a time but
			he was happy only when he was far from them, beyond their
			call, alone or in the company of phantasmal comrades. </p>
		<p>In the vestry a plump freshfaced jesuit and an elderly man,
			in shabby blue clothes, were dabbling in a case of paints and
			chalks. The boys who had been painted walked about or stood
			still awkwardly, touching their faces in a gingerly fashion with
			their furtive fingertips. In the middle of the vestry a young
			jesuit, who was then on a visit to the college, stood rocking
			himself rhythmically from the tips of his toes to his heels and
			back again, his hands thrust well forward into his sidepockets.
			His small head set off with glossy red curls and his newly
			shaven face agreed well with the spotless decency of his soutane
			and with his spotless shoes. </p>
		<p>As he watched this swaying form and tried to read for
			himself the legend of the priest's mocking smile there came
			into Stephen's memory a saying which he had heard from his
			father before he had been sent to Clongowes, that you could
			always tell a jesuit by the style of his clothes. At the same
			moment he thought he saw a likeness between his father's
			mind and that of this smiling welldressed priest: and he was
			aware of some desecration of the priest's office or of the vestry
			itself, whose silence was now routed by loud talk and joking
			and its air pungent with the smells of the gasjets and the
			grease. </p>
		<p>While his forehead was being wrinkled and his jaws painted
			black and blue by the elderly man he listened distractedly to
			the voice of the plump young jesuit which bade him speak up
			and make his points clearly. He could hear the band playing
			<emph>The Lily of Killarney</emph> and knew that in a few moments the
			curtain would go up. He felt no stage fright but the thought of
			the part he had to play humiliated him. A remembrance  of
			some of his lines made a sudden flush rise to his painted
			cheeks. He saw her serious alluring eyes watching him from
			among the audience and their image at once swept away his
			scruples, leaving his will compact. Another nature seemed to
			have been lent him: the infection of the excitement and youth
			about him entered into and transformed his moody mistrustfulness.
			For one rare moment he seemed to be clothed in the
			real apparel of boyhood: and, as he stood in the wings among
			the other players, he shared the common mirth amid which
			the drop scene was hauled upwards by two ablebodied priests
			with violent jerks and all awry. </p>
		<p>A few moments after he found himself on the stage amid
			the garish gas and the dim scenery, acting before the innumerable
			faces of the void. It surprised him to see that the play
			which he had known at rehearsals for a disjointed lifeless thing
			had suddenly assumed a life of its own. It seemed now to play
			itself, he and his fellow actors aiding it with their parts. When
			the curtain fell on the last scene he heard the void filled with
			applause and, through a rift in the side scene, saw the simple
			body before which he had acted magically deformed, the void
			of faces breaking at all points and falling asunder into busy
			groups. </p>
		<p>He left the stage quickly and rid himself of his mummery
			and passed out through the chapel into the college garden.
			Now that the play was over his nerves cried for some further
			adventure. He hurried onwards as if to overtake it. The doors
			of the theatre were all open and the audience had emptied out.
			On the lines which he had fancied the moorings of an ark a
			few lanterns swung in the night breeze, flickering cheerlessly.
			He mounted the steps from the garden in haste, eager that
			some prey should not elude him, and forced his way through
			the crowd in the hall and past the two jesuits who stood
			watching the exodus and bowing and shaking hands with the
			visitors. He pushed onward nervously, feigning a still greater
			haste and faintly conscious of the smiles and stares and nudges
			which his powdered head left in its wake. </p>
		<p>When he came out on the steps he saw his family waiting
			for him at the first lamp. In a glance he noted that every figure
			of the group was familiar and ran down the steps angrily. </p>
		<p>—I have to leave a message down in George's Street, he
			said to his father quickly. I'll be home after you. </p>
		<p>Without waiting for his father's questions  he ran across the
			road and began to walk at breakneck speed down the hill. He
			hardly knew where he was walking. Pride and hope and desire
			like crushed herbs in his heart sent up vapours of maddening
			incense before the eyes of his mind. He strode down the hill
			amid the tumult of suddenrisen vapours of wounded pride and
			fallen hope and baffled desire. They streamed upwards before
			his anguished eyes in dense and maddening fumes and passed
			away above him till at last the air was clear and cold again. </p>
		<p>A film still veiled his eyes but they burned no longer. A
			power, akin to that which had often made anger or resentment
			fall from him, brought his steps to rest. He stood still and
			gazed up at the sombre porch of the morgue and from that to
			the dark cobbled laneway at its side. He saw the word <emph>Lotts</emph>
			on the wall of the lane and breathed slowly the rank heavy air. </p>
		<p>—That is horse piss and rotted straw, he thought. It is a
			good odour to breathe. It will calm my heart. My heart is quite
			calm now. I will go back. </p>

		<p>Stephen was once again seated beside his father in the
			corner of a railway carriage at Kingsbridge. He was travelling
			with his father by the night mail to Cork. As the train steamed
			out of the station he recalled his childish wonder of years
			before and every event of his first day at Clongowes. But he
			felt no wonder now. He saw the darkening lands slipping past
			him, the silent telegraphpoles passing his window swiftly every
			four seconds, the little glimmering stations, manned by a few
			silent sentries, flung by the mail behind her and twinkling for a
			moment in the darkness like fiery grains flung backwards by a
			runner. </p>
		<p>He listened without sympathy to his father's evocation of
			Cork and of scenes of his youth, a tale broken by sighs or
			draughts from his pocketflask whenever the image of some
			dead friend appeared in it or whenever the evoker remembered
			suddenly the purpose of his actual visit. Stephen heard but
			could feel no pity. The images of the dead were all strange to
			him save that of uncle Charles, an image which had lately
			been fading out of memory. He knew, however, that his father's
			property was going to be sold by auction and in the
			manner of his own dispossession he felt the world give the lie
			rudely to his phantasy. </p>
		<p>At Maryborough he fell asleep. When he awoke the train
			had passed out of Mallow and his father was stretched asleep
			on the other seat. The cold light of the dawn lay over the
			country, over the unpeopled fields and the closed cottages.
			The terror of sleep fascinated his mind as he watched the
			silent country or heard from time to time his father's deep
			breath or sudden sleepy movement. The neighbourhood of
			unseen sleepers filled him with strange dread as though they
			could harm him; and he prayed that the day might come
			quickly. His prayer,  addressed neither to God nor saint, began
			with a shiver, as the chilly morning breeze crept through the
			chink of the carriage door to his feet, and ended in a trail of
			foolish words which he made to fit the insistent rhythm of the
			train; and silently, at intervals of four seconds, the
			telegraphpoles held the galloping notes of the music between punctual
			bars. This furious music allayed his dread and, leaning against
			the windowledge, he let his eyelids close again. </p>
		<p>They drove in a jingle across Cork while it was still early
			morning and Stephen finished his sleep in a bedroom of the
			Victoria Hotel. The bright warm sunlight was streaming
			through the window and he could hear the din of traffic. His
			father was standing before the dressingtable, examining his
			hair and face and moustache with great care, craning his neck
			across the waterjug and drawing it back sideways to see the
			better. While he did so he sang softly to himself with quaint
			accent and phrasing: </p>
		<lg>
			<l>'Tis youth and folly </l>
			<l>Makes young men marry, </l>
			<l>So here, my love, I'll </l>
			<l>No longer stay.</l>
			<l>What can't be cured, sure, </l>
			<l>Must be injured, sure, </l>
			<l>So I'll go to </l>
			<l>Amerikay.</l>
			<l>My love she's handsome, </l>
			<l>My love she's bonny: </l>
			<l>She's like good whisky </l>
			<l>When it is new;</l>
			<l>But when 'tis old </l>
			<l>And growing cold </l>
			<l>It fades and dies like </l>
			<l>The mountain dew.</l>
		</lg>
		<p>The consciousness of the warm sunny city outside his
			window and the tender tremors with which his father's voice
			festooned the strange sad happy air, drove off all the mists of
			the night's ill humour from Stephen's brain. He got up quickly
			to dress and, when the song had ended, said: </p>
		<p>—That's much prettier than any of your other <emph>come-all-yous</emph>. </p>
		<p>—Do you think so? asked Mr Dedalus. </p>
		<p>—I like it, said Stephen. </p>
		<p>—It's a pretty old air, said Mr Dedalus, twirling the points
			of his moustache. Ah, but you should have heard Mick Lacy
			sing it! Poor Mick Lacy! He had little turns for it, grace notes
			he used to put in that I haven't got. That was the boy who
			could sing a <emph>come-all-you</emph>, if you like. </p>
		<p>Mr Dedalus had ordered drisheens for breakfast and during
			the meal he crossexamined the waiter for local news. For the
			most part they spoke at crosspurposes when a name was
			mentioned, the waiter having in mind the present holder and
			Mr Dedalus his father or perhaps his grandfather. </p>
		<p>—Well, I hope they haven't moved the Queen's College
			anyhow, said Mr Dedalus, for I want to show it to this youngster
			of mine. </p>
		<p>Along the Mardyke the trees were in bloom. They entered
			the grounds of the college and were led by the garrulous
			porter across the quadrangle. But their progress across the
			gravel was brought to a halt after  every dozen or so paces by
			some reply of the porter's. </p>
		<p>—Ah, do you tell me so? And is poor Pottlebelly dead? </p>
		<p>—Yes, sir. Dead, sir. </p>
		<p>During these halts Stephen stood awkwardly behind the two
			men, weary of the subject and waiting restlessly for the slow
			march to begin again. By the time they had crossed the quadrangle
			his restlessness had risen to fever. He wondered how
			his father, whom he knew for a shrewd suspicious man, could
			be duped by the servile manners of the porter; and the lively
			southern speech which had entertained him all the morning
			now irritated his ears. </p>
		<p>They passed into the anatomy theatre where Mr Dedalus,
			the porter aiding him, searched the desks for his initials.
			Stephen remained in the background, depressed more than
			ever by the darkness and silence of the theatre and by the air it
			wore of jaded and formal study. On the desk before him he
			read the word <emph>Foetus</emph>  cut several times in the dark stained
			wood. The sudden legend startled his blood: he seemed to feel
			the absent students of the college about him and to shrink
			from their company. A vision of their life, which his father's
			words had been powerless to evoke, sprang up before him out
			of the word cut in the desk. A broadshouldered student with a
			moustache was cutting in the letters with a jackknife, seriously.
			Other students stood or sat near him laughing at his
			handiwork. One jogged his elbow. The big student turned on
			him, frowning. He was dressed in loose grey clothes and had
			tan boots. </p>
		<p>Stephen's name was called. He hurried down the steps of
			the theatre so as to be as far away from the vision as he could
			be and, peering closely at his father's initials, hid his flushed
			face. </p>
		<p>But the word and the vision capered before his eyes as he
			walked back across the quadrangle and towards the college
			gate. It shocked him to find in the outer world a trace of what
			he had deemed till then a brutish and individual malady of his
			own mind. His recent monstrous reveries came thronging into
			his memory. They too had sprung up before him, suddenly
			and furiously, out of mere words. He had soon given in to
			them and allowed them to sweep across and abase his intellect,
			wondering always where they came from, from what den
			of monstrous images, and always weak and humble towards
			others, restless and sickened of himself when they had swept
			over him. </p>
		<p>—Ay, bedad! And there's the Groceries sure enough! cried
			Mr Dedalus. You often heard me speak of the Groceries,
			didn't you, Stephen. Many's the time we went down there
			when our names had been marked, a crowd of us, Harry
			Peard and little Jack Mountain and Bob Dyas and Maurice
			Moriarty, the Frenchman, and Tom O'Grady and Mick Lacy
			that I told you of this morning and Joey Corbet and poor little
			good hearted Johnny Keevers of the Tantiles. </p>
		<p>The leaves of the trees along the Mardyke were astir and
			whispering in the sunlight. A team of cricketers passed, agile
			young men in flannels and blazers, one of them carrying the
			long green wicketbag. In a quiet bystreet a German band of
			five players in faded uniforms and with battered brass instruments
			was playing to an audience of street arabs and leisurely
			messenger boys. A maid in a white cap and apron was watering
			a box of plants on a sill which shone like a slab of limestone
			in the warm glare. From another window open to the air
			came the sound of a piano, scale after scale rising into the
			treble. </p>
		<p>Stephen walked on at his father's side, listening to stories he
			had heard before, hearing again the names of the scattered and
			dead revellers who had been the companions of his father's
			youth. And a faint sickness sighed in his heart. He recalled his
			own equivocal position in Belvedere, a free boy, a leader
			afraid of his own authority, proud and sensitive and suspicious,
			battling against the squalor of his life and against the
			riot of his mind. The letters cut in the stained wood of the
			desk stared upon him, mocking his bodily weakness and futile
			enthusiasms and making him loathe himself for his own mad
			and filthy orgies. The spittle in his throat grew bitter and foul
			to swallow and the faint sickness climbed to his brain so that
			for a moment he closed his eyes and walked on in darkness. </p>
		<p>He could still hear his father's voice </p>
		<p>—When you kick out for yourself, Stephen - as I daresay
			you will one of those days - remember, whatever you do, to
			mix with gentlemen. When I was a young fellow I tell you I
			enjoyed myself. I mixed with fine decent fellows. Everyone of
			us could do something. One fellow had a good voice, another
			fellow was a good actor, another could sing a good comic
			song, another was a good oarsman or a good racketplayer,
			another could tell a good story and so on. We kept the ball
			rolling anyhow and enjoyed ourselves and saw a bit of life and
			we were none the worse of it either. But we were all gentlemen,
			Stephen - at least I hope we were - and bloody good
			honest Irishmen too. That's the kind of fellows I want you to
			associate with, fellows of the right kidney. I'm talking to you
			as a friend, Stephen. I don't believe in playing the stern father.
			I don't believe a son should be afraid of his father. No, I treat
			you as your grandfather treated me when I was a young chap.
			We were more like brothers than father and son. I'll never
			forget the first day he caught me smoking. I was standing at
			the end of the South Terrace one day with some maneens like
			myself and sure we thought we were grand fellows because we
			had pipes stuck in the corners of our mouths. Suddenly the
			governor passed. He didn't say a word, or stop even. But the
			next day, Sunday, we were out for a walk together and when
			we were coming home he took out his cigar case and said:
			<emph>By the bye, Simon, I didn't know you smoked:</emph> or something
			like that. Of course I tried to carry it off as best I could. <emph>If
				you want a good smoke</emph>, he said, <emph>try one of these cigars. An
				American captain made me a present of them last night in
				Queenstown</emph>. </p>
		<p>Stephen heard his father's voice break into a laugh which
			was almost a sob. </p>
		<p>—He was the handsomest man in Cork at that time, by
			God he was! The women used to stand to look after him in the
			street. </p>
		<p>He heard the sob passing loudly down his father's throat
			and opened his eyes with a nervous impulse. The sunlight
			breaking suddenly on his sight turned the sky and clouds into
			a fantastic world of sombre masses with lakelike spaces of
			dark rosy light. His very brain was sick and powerless. He
			could scarcely interpret the letters of the signboards of the
			shops. By his monstrous way of life he seemed to have put
			himself beyond the limits of reality. Nothing moved him or
			spoke to him from the real world unless he heard in it an echo
			of the infuriated cries within him. He could respond to no
			earthly or human appeal, dumb and insensible to the call of
			summer and gladness and companionship, wearied and dejected
			by his father's voice. He could scarcely recognise as his
			his own thoughts, and repeated slowly to himself: </p>
		<p>—I am Stephen Dedalus. I am walking beside my father
			whose name is Simon Dedalus. We are in Cork, in Ireland.
			Cork is a city. Our room is in the Victoria Hotel. Victoria and
			Stephen and Simon. Simon and Stephen and Victoria. Names. </p>
		<p>The memory of his childhood suddenly grew dim. He tried
			to call forth some of its vivid moments but could not. He
			recalled only names: Dante, Parnell, Clane, Clongowes. A
			little boy had been taught geography by an old woman who
			kept two brushes in her wardrobe. Then he had been sent
			away from home to a college. In the college he had made his
			first communion and eaten slim jim out of his cricketcap and
			watched the firelight leaping and dancing on the wall of a little
			bedroom in the infirmary and dreamed of being dead, of mass
			being said for him by the rector in a black and gold cope, of
			being buried then in the little graveyard of the community off
			the main avenue of limes. But he had not died then. Parnell
			had died. There had been no mass for the dead in the chapel
			and no procession. He had not died but he had faded out like
			a film in the sun. He had been lost or had wandered out of
			existence for he no longer existed. How strange to think of
			him passing out of existence in such a way, not by death but
			by fading out in the sun or by being lost and forgotten somewhere
			in the universe! It was strange to see his small body
			appear again for a moment: a little boy in a grey belted suit.
			His hands were in his sidepockets and his trousers were
			tucked in at the  knees by elastic bands. </p>
		<p>On the evening of the day on which the property was sold
			Stephen followed his father meekly about the city from bar to
			bar. To the sellers in the market, to the barmen and barmaids,
			to the beggars who importuned him for a lob Mr Dedalus told
			the same tale, that he was an old Corkonian, that he had been
			trying for thirty years to get rid of his Cork accent up in Dublin
			and that Peter Pickackafax beside him was his eldest son
			but that he was only a Dublin jackeen. </p>
		<p>They had set out early in the morning from Newcombe's
			coffeehouse where Mr Dedalus' cup had rattled noisily against
			its saucer, and Stephen had tried to cover that shameful sign
			of his father's drinkingbout of the night before by moving his
			chair and coughing. One humiliation had succeeded another:
			the false smiles of the market sellers, the curvettings and
			oglings of the barmaids with whom his father flirted, the
			compliments and encouraging words of his father's friends.
			They had told him that he had a great look of his grandfather
			and Mr Dedalus had agreed that he was an ugly likeness. They
			had unearthed traces of a Cork accent in his speech and made
			him admit that the Lee was a much finer river than the Liffey.
			One of them in order to put his Latin to the proof had made
			him translate short passages from Dilectus and asked him
			whether it was correct to say: <seg xml:lang="la">Tempora mutantur nos et
					mutamur in illis</seg> or <seg xml:lang="la">Tempora mutantur et nos mutamur in illis</seg>.
			Another, a brisk old man, whom Mr Dedalus called Johnny
			Cashman, had covered him with confusion by asking him to
			say which were prettier, the Dublin girls or the Cork girls. </p>
		<p>—He's not that way built, said Mr Dedalus. Leave him
			alone. He's a levelheaded thinking boy who doesn't bother
			his head about that kind of nonsense. </p>
		<p>—Then he's not his father's son, said the little old man. </p>
		<p>—I don't know, I'm sure, said Mr Dedalus, smiling
			complacently. </p>
		<p>—Your father, said the little old man to Stephen, was the
			boldest flirt in the city of Cork in his day. Do you know that? </p>
		<p>Stephen looked down and studied the tiled floor of the bar
			into which they had drifted. </p>
		<p>—Now don't be putting ideas into his head, said Mr Dedalus.
			Leave him to his Maker. </p>
		<p>—Yerra, sure I wouldn't put any ideas into his head. I'm
			old enough to be his grandfather. And I am a grandfather,
			said the little old man to Stephen. Do you know that? </p>
		<p>—Are you? asked Stephen. </p>
		<p>—Bedad I am, said the little old man. I have two bouncing
			grandchildren out at Sunday's Well. Now then! What age do
			you think I am? And I remember seeing your grandfather in
			his red coat riding out to hounds. That was before you were
			born. </p>
		<p>—Ay, or thought of, said Mr Dedalus. </p>
		<p>—Bedad I did, repeated the little old man. And, more than
			that,  I can remember even your greatgrandfather, old John
			Stephen Dedalus, and a fierce old fireeater he was. Now then!
			There's a memory for you! </p>
		<p>—That's three generations - four generations, said another
			of the company. Why, Johnny Cashman, you must be nearing
			the century. </p>
		<p>—Well, I'll tell you the truth, said the little old man. I'm
			just twentyseven years of age. </p>
		<p>—We're as old as we feel, Johnny, said Mr Dedalus. And
			just finish what you have there, and we'll have another. Here,
			Tim or Tom or whatever your name is, give us the same again
			here. By God, I don't feel more than eighteen myself. There's
			that son of mine there not half my age and I'm a better man
			than he is any day of the week. </p>
		<p>—Draw it mild now, Dedalus. I think it's time for you to
			take a back seat, said the gentleman who had spoken before. </p>
		<p>—No, by God! asserted Mr Dedalus. I'll sing a tenor song
			against him or I'll vault a fivebarred gate against him or I'll
			run with him after the hounds across the country as I did
			thirty years ago along with the Kerry Boy and the best man
			for it. </p>
		<p>—But he'll beat you here, said the little old man, tapping
			his forehead and raising his glass to drain it. </p>
		<p>—Well, I hope he'll be as good a man as his father. That's
			all I can say, said Mr Dedalus. </p>
		<p>—If he is, he'll do, said the little old man. </p>
		<p>—And thanks be to God, Johnny, said Mr Dedalus, that we
			lived so long and did so little harm. </p>
		<p>—But did so much good, Simon, said the little old man
			gravely. Thanks be to God we lived so long and did so much
			good. </p>
		<p>Stephen watched the three glasses being raised from the
			counter as his father and his two cronies drank to the memory
			of their past. An abyss of fortune or of temperament sundered
			him from them. His mind seemed older than theirs: it shone
			coldly on their strifes and happiness and regrets like a moon
			upon a younger earth. No life or youth stirred in him as it had
			stirred in them. He had known neither the pleasure of companionship
			with others nor the vigour of rude male health nor
			filial piety. Nothing stirred within his soul but a cold and cruel
			and loveless lust. His childhood was dead or lost and with it
			his soul capable of simple joys, and he was drifting amid life
			like the barren shell of the moon. </p>
		<lg>
			<l>Art thou pale for weariness </l>
			<l>Of climbing heaven and gazing on the earth, </l>
			<l>Wandering companionless ...? </l>
		</lg>
		<p>He repeated to himself the lines of Shelley's fragment. Its
			alternation of sad human ineffectualness with vast inhuman
			cycles of activity chilled him, and he forgot his own human
			and ineffectual grieving. </p>

		<p>Stephen's mother and his brother and one of his cousins
			waited at the corner of quiet Foster Place while he and his
			father went up the steps and along the colonnade where the
			highland sentry was parading. When they had passed into the
			great hall and stood at the counter Stephen drew forth his
			orders on the governor of the bank of Ireland for thirty and
			three pounds; and these sums, the moneys of his exhibition
			and essay prize, were paid over to him rapidly by the teller in
			notes and in coin respectively. He bestowed them in his
			pockets with feigned  composure and suffered the friendly
			teller, to whom his father chatted, to take his hand across the
			broad counter and wish him a brilliant career in after life. He
			was impatient of their voices and could not keep his feet at
			rest. But the teller still deferred the serving of others to say he
			was living in changed times and that there was nothing like
			giving a boy the best education that money could buy. Mr
			Dedalus lingered in the hall gazing about him and up at the
			roof and telling Stephen, who urged him to come out, that
			they were standing in the house of commons of the old Irish
			parliament. </p>
		<p>—God help us! he said piously, to think of the men of those
			times, Stephen, Hely Hutchinson and Flood and Henry Grattan
			and Charles Kendal Bushe, and the noblemen we have
			now, leaders of the Irish people at home and abroad. Why, by
			God, they wouldn't be seen dead in a tenacre field with them.
			No, Stephen, old chap, I'm sorry to say that they are only as I
			roved out one fine May morning in the merry month of sweet
			July. </p>
		<p>A keen October wind was blowing round the bank. The
			three figures standing at the edge of the muddy path had
			pinched cheeks and watery eyes. Stephen looked at his thinly
			clad mother and remembered that a few days before he had
			seen a mantle priced at twenty guineas in the windows of
			Barnardo's. </p>
		<p>—Well that's done, said Mr Dedalus. </p>
		<p>—We had better go to dinner, said Stephen. Where? </p>
		<p>—Dinner? said Mr Dedalus. Well, I suppose we had better,
			what? </p>
		<p>—Some place that's not too dear, said Mrs Dedalus. </p>
		<p>—Underdone's? </p>
		<p>—Yes. Some quiet place. </p>
		<p>—Come along, said Stephen quickly. It doesn't matter
			about the dearness. </p>
		<p>He walked on before them with short nervous steps, smiling.
			They tried to keep up with him, smiling also at his eagerness. </p>
		<p>—Take it easy like a good young fellow, said his father.
			We're not out for the half mile, are we? </p>
		<p>For a swift season of merrymaking the money of his prizes
			ran through Stephen's  fingers. Great parcels of groceries and
			delicacies and dried fruits arrived from the city. Every day he
			drew up a bill of fare for the family and every night led a party
			of three or four to the theatre to see <emph>Ingomar</emph> or <emph>The Lady of
			Lyons</emph>. In his coat pockets he carried squares of Vienna chocolate
			for his guests while his trousers' pockets bulged with
			masses of silver and copper coins. He bought presents for
			everyone, overhauled his room, wrote out resolutions, marshalled
			his books up and down their shelves, pored upon all
			kinds of price lists, drew up a form of commonwealth for the
			household by which every member of it held some office,
			opened a loan bank for his family and pressed loans on willing
			borrowers so that he might have the pleasure of making out
			receipts and reckoning the interests on the sums lent. When he
			could do no more he drove up and down the city in trams.
			Then the season of pleasure came to an end. The pot of pink
			enamel paint gave out and the wainscot of his bedroom remained
			with its unfinished and illplastered coat. </p>
		<p>His household returned to its usual way of life. His mother
			had no further occasion to upbraid him for squandering his
			money. He too returned to his old life at school and all his
			novel enterprises fell to pieces. The commonwealth fell, the
			loan bank closed its coffers and its books on a sensible loss,
			the rules of life which he had drawn about himself fell into
			desuetude. </p>
		<p>How foolish his aim had been! He had tried to build a
			breakwater of order and elegance against the sordid tide of life
			without him and to dam up, by rules of conduct and active
			interests and new filial relations, the powerful recurrence of
			the tides within him. Useless. From without as from within the
			water had flowed over his barriers: their tides began once
			more to jostle fiercely above the crumbled mole. </p>
		<p>He saw clearly too his own futile isolation. He had not gone
			one step nearer the lives he had sought to approach nor
			bridged the restless shame and rancour that divided him from
			mother and brother and sister. He felt that he was hardly of
			the one blood with them but stood to them rather in the mystical
			kinship of fosterage, fosterchild and fosterbrother. </p>
		<p>He burned to appease the fierce longings of his heart before
			which everything else was idle and alien. He cared little that
			he was in mortal sin, that his life had grown to be a tissue of
			subterfuge and falsehood. Beside the savage desire within him
			to realise the enormities which he brooded on nothing was
			sacred. He bore cynically with the shameful details of his
			secret riots in which he exulted to defile with patience whatever
			image had attracted his eyes. By day and by night he
			moved among distorted images of the outer world. A figure
			that had seemed to him by day demure and innocent  came
			towards him by night through the winding darkness of sleep,
			her face transfigured by a lecherous cunning, her eyes bright
			with brutish joy. Only the morning pained him with its dim
			memory of dark orgiastic riot, its keen and humiliating sense of
			transgression. </p>
		<p>He returned to his wanderings. The veiled autumnal evenings
			led him from street to street as they had led him years
			before along the quiet avenues of Blackrock. But no vision of
			trim front gardens or of kindly lights in the windows poured a
			tender influence upon him now. Only at times, in the pauses of
			his desire, when the luxury that was wasting him gave room to
			a softer languor, the image of Mercedes traversed the background
			of his memory. He saw again the small white house
			and the garden of rosebushes on the road that led to the
			mountains and he remembered the sadly proud gesture of
			refusal which he was to make there, standing with her in the
			moonlit garden after years of estrangement and adventure. At
			those moments the soft speeches of Claude Melnotte rose to
			his lips and eased his unrest. A tender premonition touched
			him of the tryst he had then looked forward to and, in spite of
			the horrible reality which lay between his hope of then and
			now, of the holy encounter he had then imagined at which
			weakness and timidity and inexperience were to fall from him. </p>

		<p>Such moments passed and the wasting fires of lust sprang
			up again. The verses passed from his lips and the inarticulate
			cries and the unspoken brutal words rushed forth from his
			brain to force a passage. His blood was in revolt. He wandered
			up and down the dark slimy streets peering into the
			gloom of lanes and doorways, listening eagerly for any sound.
			He moaned to himself like some baffled prowling beast. He
			wanted to sin with another of his kind, to force another being
			to sin with him and to exult with her in sin. He felt some dark
			presence moving irresistibly upon him from the  darkness, a
			presence subtle and murmurous as a flood filling him wholly
			with itself. Its murmur besieged his ears like the murmur of
			some multitude in sleep; its subtle streams penetrated his
			being. His hands clenched convulsively and his teeth set
			together as he suffered the agony of its penetration. He
			stretched out his arms in the street to hold fast the frail swooning
			form that eluded him and incited him: and the cry that he
			had strangled for so long in his throat issued from his lips. It
			broke from him like a wail of despair from a hell of sufferers
			and died in a wail of furious entreaty, a cry for an iniquitous
			abandonment, a cry which was but the echo of an obscene
			scrawl which he had read on the oozing wall of a urinal. </p>
		<p>He had wandered into a maze of narrow and dirty streets.
			From the foul laneways he heard bursts of hoarse riot and
			wrangling and the drawling of drunken singers. He walked
			onward, undismayed, wondering whether he had strayed into
			the quarter of the jews. Women and girls dressed in long vivid
			gowns traversed the street from house to house. They were
			leisurely and perfumed. A trembling seized him and his eyes
			grew dim. The yellow gasflames arose before his troubled
			vision against the vapoury sky, burning as if before an altar.
			Before the doors and in the lighted halls groups were gathered
			arrayed as for some rite. He was in another world: he had
			awakened from a slumber of centuries. </p>
		<p>He stood still in the middle of the roadway, his heart clamouring
			against his bosom in a tumult. A young woman dressed
			in a long pink gown laid her hand on his arm to detain him
			and gazed into his face. She said gaily: </p>
		<p>—Good night, Willie dear! </p>
		<p>Her room was warm and lightsome. A huge doll sat with
			her legs apart in the copious easychair beside the bed. He tried
			to bid his tongue speak that he might seem at ease, watching
			her as she undid her gown, noting the proud conscious movements
			of her perfumed head. </p>
		<p>As he stood silent in the middle of the room she came over
			to him and embraced him gaily and gravely. Her round arms
			held him firmly to her and he, seeing her face lifted to him in
			serious calm and feeling the warm calm rise and fall of her
			breast, all but burst into hysterical weeping. Tears of joy and
			relief shone in his delighted eyes and his lips parted though
			they would not speak. </p>
		<p>She passed her tinkling hand through his hair, calling him a
			little rascal. </p>
		<p>—Give me a kiss, she said. </p>
		<p>His lips would not bend to kiss her. He wanted to be held
			firmly in her arms, to be caressed slowly, slowly, slowly. In her
			arms he felt that he had suddenly become strong and fearless
			and sure of himself. But his lips would not bend to kiss her. </p>
		<p>With a sudden movement she bowed his head and joined
			her lips to his and he read the meaning of her movements in
			her frank uplifted eyes. It was too much for him. He closed his
			eyes, surrendering himself to her, body and mind, conscious of
			nothing in the world but the dark pressure of her softly parting
			lips. They pressed upon his brain as upon his lips as though
			they were the vehicle of a vague speech; and between them he
			felt an unknown and timid pressure, darker than the swoon of
			sin, softer than sound or odour. </p>

		<head><l>III</l></head>

		<p>The swift December dusk had come tumbling clownishly
			after its dull day and, as he stared through the dull
			square of the window of the schoolroom, he felt his belly crave
			for its food. He hoped there would be stew for dinner, turnips
			and carrots and bruised potatoes and fat mutton pieces to be
			ladled out in thick peppered flourfattened sauce. Stuff it into
			you, his belly counselled him. </p>
		<p>It would be a gloomy secret night. After early nightfall the
			yellow lamps would light up, here and there, the squalid
			quarter of the brothels. He would follow a devious course up
			and down the streets, circling always nearer and nearer in a
			tremor of fear and joy, until his feet led him suddenly round a
			dark corner. The whores would be just coming out of their
			houses making ready for the night, yawning lazily after their
			sleep and settling the hairpins in their clusters of hair. He
			would pass by them calmly waiting for a sudden movement of
			his own will or a sudden call to his sinloving soul from their
			soft perfumed flesh. Yet as he prowled in quest of that call, his
			senses, stultified only by his desire, would note keenly all that
			wounded or shamed them; his eyes, a ring of porter froth on a
			clothless table or a photograph of two soldiers standing to
			attention or a gaudy playbill; his ears, the drawling jargon of
			greeting: </p>
		<p>—Hello, Bertie, any good in your mind? </p>
		<p>—Is that you, pigeon? </p>
		<p>—Number ten. Fresh Nelly is waiting on you. </p>
		<p>—Goodnight, husband! Coming in to have a short time? </p>
		<p>The equation on the page of his scribbler began to spread
			out a widening tail, eyed and starred like a peacock's; and,
			when the eyes and stars of its indices had been eliminated,
			began slowly to fold itself together again. The indices appearing
			and disappearing were eyes opening and closing; the eyes
			opening and closing were stars being born and being
			quenched. The vast cycle of starry life bore his weary  mind
			outward to its verge and inward to its centre, a distant music
			accompanying him outward and inward. What music? The
			music came nearer and he recalled the words, the words of
			Shelley's fragment upon the moon wandering companionless,
			pale for weariness. The stars began to crumble and a cloud of
			fine stardust fell through space. </p>
		<p>The dull light fell more faintly upon the page whereon
			another equation began to unfold itself slowly and to spread
			abroad its widening tail. It was his own soul going forth to
			experience, unfolding itself sin by sin, spreading abroad the
			balefire of its burning stars and folding back upon itself, fading
			slowly, quenching its own lights and fires. They were
			quenched: and the cold darkness filled chaos. </p>
		<p>A cold lucid indifference reigned in his soul. At his first
			violent sin he had felt a wave of vitality pass out of him and
			had feared to find his body or his soul maimed by the excess.
			Instead the vital wave had carried him on its bosom out of
			himself and back again when it receded: and no part of body
			or soul had been maimed but a dark peace had been established
			between them. The chaos in which his ardour extinguished
			itself was a cold indifferent knowledge of himself. He
			had sinned mortally not once but many times and he knew
			that, while he stood in danger of eternal damnation for the
			first sin alone, by every succeeding sin he multiplied his guilt
			and his punishment. His days and works and thoughts could
			make no atonement for him, the fountains of sanctifying grace
			having ceased to refresh his soul. At most, by an alms given to
			a beggar whose blessing he fled from, he might hope wearily
			to win for himself some measure of actual grace. Devotion
			had gone by the board. What did it avail to pray when he
			knew that his soul lusted after its own destruction? A certain
			pride, a certain awe, withheld him from offering to God even
			one prayer at night though he knew it was in God's power to
			take away his life while he slept and hurl his soul hellward ere
			he could beg for mercy. His pride in his own sin, his loveless
			awe of God, told him that his offence was too grievous to be
			atoned for in whole or in part by a false homage to the Allseeing
			and Allknowing. </p>
		<p>—Well now, Ennis, I declare you have a head and so has
			my stick! Do you mean to say that you are not able to tell
			me what a surd is? </p>
		<p>The blundering answer stirred the embers of his contempt
			of his fellows. Towards others he felt neither shame nor fear.
			On Sunday mornings as he passed the churchdoor he glanced
			coldly at the worshippers who stood bareheaded, four deep,
			outside the church, morally present at the mass which they
			could neither see nor hear. Their dull piety and the sickly smell
			of the cheap hairoil with which they had anointed their heads
			repelled him from the altar they prayed at. He stooped to the
			evil of hypocrisy with others, sceptical of their innocence
			which he could cajole so easily. </p>
		<p>On the wall of his bedroom hung an illuminated scroll, the
			certificate of his prefecture in the college of the sodality of the
			Blessed Virgin Mary. On Saturday mornings when the sodality
			met in the chapel to recite the little office his place was a
			cushioned kneelingdesk at the right of the altar from which he
			led his wing of boys through the responses. The falsehood of
			his position did not pain him. If at moments he felt an impulse
			to rise from his post of honour and, confessing before them all
			his unworthiness, to leave the chapel, a glance at their faces
			restrained him. The imagery of the psalms of prophecy
			soothed his barren pride. The glories of Mary held his soul
			captive: spikenard and myrrh and frankincense, symbolising
			the preciousness of God's gifts to her soul, rich garments,
			symbolising her royal lineage, her emblems, the lateflowering
			plant and lateblossoming tree, symbolising the agelong gradual
			growth of her cultus among men. When it fell to him to
			read the lesson towards the close of the office he read it in a
			veiled voice, lulling his conscience to its music. </p>
		<lg>
			<l>Quasi cedrus exaltata sum in Libanon et quasi cupressus in </l>
			<l>monte Sion. Quasi palma exaltata sum in Gades et quasi </l>
			<l>plantatio rosae in Jericho. Quasi uliva speciosa in campis et </l>
			<l>quasi platanus exaltata sum juxta aquam in plateis. Sicut </l>
			<l>cinnamomum et balsamum aromatizans odorem dedi et quasi </l>
			<l>myrrha electa dedi suavitatem odoris.</l>
		</lg>
		<p>His sin, which had covered him from the sight of God, had
			led him nearer to the refuge of sinners. Her eyes seemed to
			regard him with mild pity; her holiness, a strange light glowing
			faintly upon her frail flesh, did not humiliate the sinner who
			approached her. If ever he was impelled to cast sin from him
			and to repent the impulse that moved him was the wish to be
			her knight. If ever his soul, reentering her dwelling shyly after
			the frenzy of his body's lust had spent itself, was turned towards
			her whose emblem is the morning star, <emph>bright and
			musical, telling of heaven and infusing peace</emph>, it was when her
			names were murmured softly by lips whereon there still lingered
			foul and shameful words, the savour itself of a lewd kiss. </p>
		<p>That was strange. He tried to think how it could be but the
			dusk, deepening in the schoolroom, covered over his thoughts.
			The bell rang. The master marked the sums and cuts to be
			done for the next lesson and went out. Heron, beside Stephen,
			began to hum tunelessly. </p>
		<l><emph>My excellent friend Bombados.</emph> </l>
		<p>Ennis, who had gone to the yard, came back, saying: </p>
		<p>—The boy from the house is coming up for the rector. </p>
		<p>A tall boy behind Stephen rubbed his hands and said: </p>
		<p>—That's game ball. We can scut the whole hour. He won't
			be in till after half two. Then you can ask him questions on the
			catechism, Dedalus. </p>
		<p>Stephen, leaning back and drawing idly on his scribbler,
			listened to the talk about him which Heron checked from time
			to time by saying: </p>
		<p>—Shut up, will you. Don't make such a bally racket! </p>
		<p>It was strange too that he found an arid pleasure in following
			up to the end the rigid lines of the doctrines of the church
			and penetrating into obscure silences  only to hear and feel the
			more deeply his own condemnation. The sentence of saint
			James which says that he who offends against one commandment
			becomes guilty of all had seemed to him first a swollen
			phrase until he had begun to grope in the darkness of his own
			state. From the evil seed of lust all other deadly sins had
			sprung forth: pride in himself and contempt of others, covetousness
			in using money for the purchase of unlawful pleasure,
			envy of those whose vices he could not reach to and
			calumnious murmuring against the pious, gluttonous  enjoyment
			of food, the dull glowering anger amid which he brooded
			upon his longing, the swamp of spiritual and bodily sloth in
			which his whole being had sunk. </p>
		<p>As he sat in his bench gazing calmly at the rector's shrewd
			harsh face his mind wound itself in and out of the curious
			questions proposed to it. If a man had stolen a pound in his
			youth and had used that pound to amass a huge fortune
			how much was he obliged to give back, the pound he had
			stolen only or the pound together with the compound interest
			accruing upon it or all his huge fortune? If a layman in giving
			baptism pour the water before saying the words is the child
			baptised? Is baptism with a mineral water valid? How comes
			it that while the first beatitude promises the kingdom of
			heaven to the poor of heart the second beatitude promises also
			to the meek that they shall possess the land? Why was the
			sacrament of the eucharist instituted under the two species of
			bread and wine if Jesus Christ be present body and blood, soul
			and divinity, in the bread alone and in the wine alone? Does a
			tiny particle of the consecrated bread contain all the body and
			blood of Jesus Christ or a part only of the body and blood? If
			the wine change into vinegar and the host crumble  into corruption
			after they have been consecrated is Jesus Christ still
			present under their species as God and as man? </p>
		<p>—Here he is! Here he is! </p>
		<p>A boy from his post at the window had seen the rector
			come from the house. All the catechisms were opened and all
			heads bent upon them silently. The rector entered and took
			his seat on the dais. A gentle kick from the tall boy in the
			bench behind urged Stephen to ask a difficult question. </p>
		<p>The rector did not ask for a catechism to hear the lesson
			from. He clasped his hands on the desk and said: </p>
		<p>—The retreat will begin on Wednesday afternoon in honour
			of saint Francis Xavier whose feast day is Saturday. The
			retreat will go on from Wednesday to Friday. On Friday
			confession will be heard all the afternoon after beads. If any
			boys have special confessors perhaps it will be better for them
			not to change. Mass will be on Saturday morning at nine
			o'clock and general communion for the whole college. Saturday
			will be a free day. Sunday of course. But Saturday and
			Sunday being free days some boys might be inclined to think
			that Monday is a free day also. Beware of making that mistake.
			I think you, Lawless, are likely to make that mistake. </p>
		<p>—I, sir? Why,  sir? </p>
		<p>A little wave of quiet mirth broke forth over the class of
			boys from the rector's grim smile. Stephen's heart began
			slowly to fold and fade with fear like a withering flower. </p>
		<p>The rector went on gravely: </p>
		<p>—You are all familiar with the story of the life of saint
			Francis Xavier, I suppose, the patron of your college. He
			came of an old and illustrious Spanish family and you remember
			that he was one of the first followers of saint Ignatius.
			They met in Paris where Francis Xavier was professor of
			philosophy at the university. This young and brilliant nobleman
			and man of letters entered heart and soul into the ideas of
			our glorious founder, and you know that he, at his own desire,
			was sent by saint Ignatius to preach to the Indians. He is
			called, as you know, the apostle of the Indies. He went from
			country to country in the east, from Africa to India, from
			India to Japan, baptising  the people. He is said to have baptised
			as many as ten thousand idolaters in one month. It is said
			that his right arm had grown powerless from having been
			raised so often over the heads of those whom he baptised. He
			wished then to go to China to win still more souls for God but
			he died of fever on the island of Sancian. A great saint, saint
			Francis Xavier! A great soldier of God! </p>
		<p>The rector paused and then, shaking his clasped hands
			before him, went on: </p>
		<p>—He had the faith in him that moves mountains. Ten
			thousand souls won for God in a single month! That is a true
			conqueror, true to the motto of our order: <seg xml:lang="la">ad majorem Dei
				gloriam</seg>! A saint who has great power in heaven, remember:
			power to intercede for us in our grief, power to obtain whatever
			we pray for if it be for the good of our souls, power
			above all to obtain for us the grace to repent if we be in sin. A
			great saint, saint Francis Xavier! A great fisher of souls! </p>
		<p>He ceased to shake his clasped hands and, resting them
			against his forehead, looked right and left of them keenly at
			his listeners out of his dark stern eyes. </p>
		<p>In the silence their dark fire kindled the dusk into a tawny
			glow. Stephen's heart had withered up like a flower of the
			desert that feels the simoom  coming from afar. </p>

		<p>—<emph>Remember only thy last things and thou shalt not sin for
			ever</emph> -  words taken, my dear little brothers in Christ, from the
			book of Ecclesiastes, seventh chapter, fortieth verse. In the
			name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.
			Amen. </p>
		<p>Stephen sat in the front bench of the chapel. Father Arnall
			sat at a table to the left of the altar. He wore about his shoulders
			a heavy cloak; his pale face was drawn and his voice
			broken with rheum. The figure of his old master, so strangely
			rearisen, brought back to Stephen's mind his life at Clongowes:
			the wide playgrounds, swarming with boys, the square
			ditch, the little cemetery off the main avenue of limes where
			he had dreamed of being buried, the firelight on the wall of the
			infirmary where he lay sick, the sorrowful face of Brother
			Michael. His soul, as these memories came back to him,
			became again a child's soul. </p>
		<p>—We are assembled here today, my dear little brothers in
			Christ, for one brief moment far away from the busy bustle of
			the outer world to celebrate and to honour one of the greatest
			of  saints, the apostle of the Indies, the patron saint also of
			your college, saint Francis Xavier. Year after year for much
			longer than any of you, my dear little boys, can remember or
			than I can remember the boys of this college have met in this
			very chapel to make their annual retreat before the feast day
			of their patron saint. Time has gone on and brought with it its
			changes. Even in the last few years what changes can most of
			you not remember? Many of the boys who sat in those front
			benches a few years ago are perhaps now in distant lands, in
			the burning tropics or immersed in professional duties or in
			seminaries or voyaging over the vast expanse of the deep or, it
			may be, already called by the great God to another life and to
			the rendering up of their stewardship. And still as the years
			roll by, bringing with them changes for good and bad, the
			memory of the great saint is honoured by the boys of his
			college who make every year their annual retreat on the days
			preceding the feast day set apart by our holy mother  the
			church to transmit to all the ages the name and fame of one of
			the greatest sons of catholic Spain. </p>
		<p>—Now what is the meaning of this word <emph>retreat</emph> and why is
			it allowed on all hands to be a most salutary practice for all
			who desire to lead before God and in the eyes of men a truly
			christian life? A retreat, my dear boys, signifies a withdrawal
			for a while from the cares of our life, the cares of this workaday
			world, in order to examine the state of our conscience, to
			reflect on the mysteries of holy religion and to understand
			better why we are here in this world. During these few days I
			intend to put before you some thoughts concerning the four
			last things. They are, as you know from your catechism,
			death, judgment,  hell and heaven. We shall try to understand
			them fully during these few days so that we may derive from
			the understanding of them a lasting benefit to our souls. And
			remember, my dear boys, that we have been sent into this
			world for one thing and for one thing alone: to do God's holy
			will and to save our immortal souls. All else is worthless. One
			thing alone is needful, the salvation of one's soul. What doth it
			profit a man to gain the whole world if he suffer the loss of his
			immortal soul? Ah, my dear boys, believe me there is nothing
			in this wretched world that can make up for such a loss. </p>
		<p>—I will ask you therefore, my dear boys, to put away from
			your minds during these few days all worldly thoughts,
			whether of study or pleasure or ambition, and to give all your
			attention to the state of your souls. I need hardly remind you
			that during the days of the retreat all boys are expected to
			preserve a quiet and pious demeanour and to shun all loud
			unseemly pleasure. The elder boys, of course, will see that this
			custom is not infringed and I look especially to the prefects
			and officers of the sodality of Our Blessed Lady and of the
			sodality of the holy angels to set a good example to their
			fellowstudents. </p>
		<p>—Let us try therefore to make this retreat in honour of
			saint Francis with our whole heart and our whole mind. God's
			blessing will then be upon all your year's studies. But, above
			and beyond all, let this retreat be one to which you can look
			back in after years when maybe you are far from this college
			and among very different surroundings, to which you can look
			back with joy and thankfulness and give thanks to God for
			having granted you this occasion of laying the first foundation
			of a pious honourable zealous christian life. And if, as may so
			happen, there be at this moment in these benches any poor
			soul who has had the unutterable misfortune to lose God's
			holy grace and to fall into grievous sin I fervently trust and
			pray that this retreat may be the turningpoint in the life of that
			soul. I pray to God  through the merits of its zealous servant
			Francis Xavier that such a soul may be led to sincere repentance
			and that  the holy communion on saint Francis' day of
			this year may be a lasting covenant between God and that
			soul. For just and unjust, for saint and sinner alike, may this
			retreat be a memorable one. </p>
		<p>—Help me, my dear little brothers in Christ. Help me by
			your pious attention, by your own devotion, by your outward
			demeanour. Banish from your minds all worldly thoughts and
			think only of the last things, death, judgment, hell and heaven.
			He who remembers these things, says Ecclesiastes, shall not
			sin for ever. He who remembers the last things will act and
			think with them always before his eyes. He will live a good life
			and die a good death, believing and knowing that, if he has
			sacrificed  much in this earthly life, it will be given to him a
			hundredfold and a thousandfold more in the life to come, in
			the kingdom without end - a blessing, my dear boys, which I
			wish you from my heart, one and all, in the name of the Father
			and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost. Amen. </p>
		<p>As he walked home with silent companions a thick fog
			seemed to compass his mind. He waited in stupor of mind till
			it should lift and reveal what it had hidden. He ate his dinner
			with surly appetite and, when the meal was over and the
			greasestrewn plates lay abandoned on the table, he rose and
			went to the window, clearing the thick scum from his mouth
			with his tongue and licking it from his lips. So he had sunk to
			the state of a beast that licks his chaps after meat. This was
			the end; and a faint glimmer of fear began to pierce the fog of
			his mind. He pressed his face against the pane of the window
			and gazed out into the darkening street. Forms passed this
			way and that through the dull light. And that was life. The
			letters of the name of Dublin lay heavily upon his mind, pushing
			one another surlily hither and thither with slow boorish
			insistence. His soul was fattening and congealing into a gross
			grease, plunging ever deeper in its dull fear into a sombre
			threatening dusk, while the body that was his stood, listless
			and dishonoured, gazing out of darkened eyes, helpless, perturbed
			and human for a bovine god to stare upon. </p>
		<p>The next day brought death and judgment, stirring his soul
			slowly from its listless despair. The faint glimmer of fear
			became a terror of spirit as the hoarse voice of the preacher
			blew death into his soul. He suffered its agony. He felt the
			deathchill touch the extremities and creep onward towards the
			heart, the film of death veiling the eyes, the bright centres of
			the brain extinguished one by one like lamps, the last sweat
			oozing upon the skin, the powerlessness of the dying limbs,
			the speech thickening and wandering and failing, the heart
			throbbing faintly and more faintly, all but vanquished, the
			breath, the poor breath, the poor helpless human spirit, sobbing
			and sighing,  gurgling  and rattling in the throat. No help!
			No help! He, he himself, his body to which he had yielded was
			dying. Into the grave with it! Nail it down into a wooden box,
			the corpse. Carry it out of the house on the shoulders of
			hirelings. Thrust it out of men's sight into a long hole in the
			ground, into the grave, to rot, to feed the mass of its creeping
			worms and to be devoured by scuttling plumpbellied rats. </p>
		<p>And while the friends were still standing in tears by the
			bedside the soul of the sinner was judged. At the last moment
			of consciousness the whole earthly life passed before the
			vision of the soul and, ere it had time to reflect, the body had
			died and the soul stood terrified before the judgmentseat.
			God, who had long been merciful, would then be just. He had
			long been patient, pleading with the sinful soul, giving it time
			to repent, sparing it yet awhile. But that time had gone. Time
			was to sin and to enjoy, time was to scoff at God and at  the
			warnings of His holy church, time was to defy His majesty, to
			disobey his commands, to hoodwink one's fellow men, to
			commit sin after sin and sin after sin and to hide one's corruption
			from the sight of men. But that time was over. Now it was
			God's turn: and He was not to be hoodwinked or deceived.
			Every sin would then come forth from its lurkingplace, the
			most rebellious against the divine will and the most degrading
			to our poor corrupt nature, the tiniest imperfection and the
			most heinous atrocity. What did it avail then to have been a
			great emperor, a great general, a marvellous inventor, the
			most learned of the learned? All were as one before the judgmentseat
			of God. He would reward the good and punish the
			wicked. One single instant was enough for the trial of a man's
			soul. One single instant after the body's death, the soul had
			been weighed in the balance. The particular judgment was
			over and the soul had passed to the abode of bliss or to the
			prison of purgatory or had been hurled howling into hell. </p>
		<p>Nor was that all. God's justice had still to be vindicated
			before men: after the particular there still remained the general
			judgment. The last day had come. Doomsday was at
			hand. The stars of heaven were falling upon the earth like the
			figs cast by the figtree which the wind has shaken. The sun, the
			great luminary of the universe, had become as sackcloth of
			hair. The moon was bloodred. The firmament was as a scroll
			rolled away. The archangel Michael, the prince of the
			heavenly host, appeared glorious and terrible against the sky.
			With one foot on the sea and one foot on the land he blew
			from the archangelical trumpet the brazen death of time. The
			three blasts of the angel filled all the universe. Time is, time
			was but time shall be no more. At the last blast the souls of
			universal humanity throng towards the valley of Jehoshaphat,
			rich and poor, gentle and simple, wise and foolish, good and
			wicked. The soul of every human being that has ever existed,
			the souls of all those who shall yet be born, all the sons and
			daughters of Adam, all are assembled on that supreme day.
			And lo the supreme judge is coming! No longer the lowly
			Lamb of God, no longer the meek Jesus of Nazareth, no
			longer the Man of Sorrows, no longer the Good Shepherd,  He
			is seen now coming upon the clouds, in great power and
			majesty, attended by nine choirs of angels, angels and archangels,
			principalities, powers and virtues, thrones and dominations,
			cherubim and seraphim, God Omnipotent, God Everlasting.
			He speaks: and His voice is heard even at the farthest
			limits of space, even in the bottomless abyss. Supreme Judge,
			from His sentence there will be and can be no appeal. He calls
			the just to His side, bidding them enter into the kingdom, the
			eternity of bliss, prepared for them. The unjust He casts from
			Him, crying in His offended majesty: <emph>Depart from me, ye
			cursed, into everlasting fire which was prepared for the devil
			and his angels.</emph> O what agony then for the miserable sinners!
			Friend is torn apart from friend, children are torn from their
			parents, husbands from their wives. The poor sinner holds out
			his arms to those who were dear to him in this earthly world,
			to those whose simple piety perhaps he made a mock of, to
			those who counselled him and tried to lead him on the right
			path, to a kind brother, to a loving sister, to the mother and
			father who loved him so dearly. But it is too late: the just turn
			away from the wretched damned souls which now appear
			before the eyes of all in their hideous and evil character. O
			you hypocrites, O you whited sepulchres, O you who present a
			smooth smiling face to the world while your soul within is a
			foul swamp of sin, how will it fare with you in that terrible
			day? </p>
		<p>And this day will come, shall come, must come; the day of
			death and the day of judgment. It is appointed unto man to
			die and after death the judgment. Death is certain. The time
			and  manner are uncertain,  whether from long disease or from
			some unexpected accident; the Son of God cometh at an hour
			when you little expect Him. Be therefore ready every moment,
			seeing that you may die at any moment. Death is the end of us
			all. Death and judgment, brought into the world by the sin of
			our first parents, are the dark portals that close our earthly
			existence, the portals that open into the unknown and the
			unseen, portals through which every soul must pass, alone,
			unaided save by its good works, without friend or  brother or
			parent or master to help it, alone and trembling. Let that
			thought be ever before our minds and then we cannot sin.
			Death, a cause of terror to the sinner, is a blessed moment for
			him who has walked in the right path, fulfilling the duties of
			his station in life, attending to his morning and evening
			prayers, approaching the holy sacrament frequently and performing
			good and merciful works. For the pious and believing
			catholic, for the just man, death is no cause of terror. Was it
			not Addison, the great English writer, who, when on his
			deathbed, sent for the wicked young earl of Warwick to let
			him see how a christian can meet his end. He it is and he alone,
			the pious and believing christian, who can say in his heart: </p>
		<lg>
			<l>O grave, where is thy victory? </l>
			<l>O death, where is thy sting? </l>
		</lg>
		<p>Every word of it was for him. Against his sin, foul and
			secret, the whole wrath of God was aimed. The preacher's
			knife had probed deeply into his diseased conscience and he
			felt now that his soul was festering in sin. Yes, the preacher
			was right. God's turn had come. Like a beast in its lair his soul
			had lain down in its own filth but the blasts of the angel's
			trumpet had driven him forth from the darkness of sin into the
			light. The words of doom cried by the angel shattered in an
			instant his presumptuous peace. The wind of the last day blew
			through his mind; his sins, the jeweleyed harlots of his imagination,
			fled before the hurricane, squeaking like mice in their
			terror and huddled under a mane of hair. </p>
		<p>As he crossed the square, walking homeward, the light
			laughter of a girl reached his burning ear. The frail gay sound
			smote his heart more strongly than a trumpetblast, and, not
			daring to lift his eyes, he turned aside and gazed, as he walked,
			into the shadow of the tangled shrubs. Shame rose from his
			smitten heart and flooded his whole being. The image of
			Emma appeared before him and, under her eyes, the flood of
			shame rushed forth anew from his heart. If she knew to what
			his mind had subjected her or how his brutelike lust had torn
			and trampled upon her innocence! Was that boyish love? Was
			that chivalry? Was that poetry? The sordid details of his orgies
			stank under his very nostrils: the sootcoated packet of pictures
			which he had hidden in the flue of the fireplace and in
			the presence of whose shameless or bashful  wantonness he lay
			for hours sinning in thought and deed; his monstrous dreams,
			peopled by apelike creatures and by harlots with gleaming
			jewel eyes; the foul long letters he had written in the joy of
			guilty confession and carried secretly for days and days only
			to throw them under cover of night among the grass in the
			corner of a field or beneath some hingeless door or in some
			niche in the hedges where a girl might come upon them as she
			walked by and read them secretly. Mad! Mad! Was it possible
			he had done these things? A cold sweat broke out upon his
			forehead as the foul memories condensed within his brain. </p>
		<p>When the agony of shame had passed from him he tried to
			raise his soul from its abject powerlessness. God and the
			Blessed Virgin were too far from him: God was too great and
			stern and the Blessed Virgin too pure and holy. But he imagined
			that he stood near Emma in a wide land and,  humbly  and
			in tears, bent and kissed the elbow of her sleeve. </p>
		<p>In the wide land under a tender lucid evening sky, a cloud
			drifting westward amid a pale green sea of heaven, they stood
			together, children that had  erred. Their error had offended
			deeply God's majesty though it was the error of two children,
			but it had not offended her whose beauty <emph>is not like earthly
			beauty, dangerous to look upon, but like the morning star
			which is its emblem, bright and musical</emph>. The eyes were not
			offended which she turned upon them nor reproachful. She
			placed their hands together, hand in hand, and said, speaking
			to their hearts: </p>
		<p>—Take hands, Stephen and Emma. It is a beautiful evening
			now in heaven. You have erred but you are always my children.
			It is one heart that loves another heart. Take hands
			together,  my  dear children, and you  will  be happy together
			and your hearts will love each other. </p>
		<p>The chapel was flooded by the dull scarlet light that filtered
			through the lowered blinds; and through the fissure between
			the last blind and the sash a shaft of wan light entered like a
			spear and touched the embossed brasses of the candlesticks
			upon the altar that gleamed like the battleworn mail armour of
			angels. </p>
		<p>Rain was falling on the chapel, on the garden, on the college.
			It would rain for ever, noiselessly. The water would rise
			inch by inch, covering the grass and shrubs, covering the trees
			and houses, covering the monuments and the mountain tops.
			All life would be choked off, noiselessly: birds, men, elephants,
			pigs, children: noiselessly floating corpses amid the
			litter of the wreckage of the world. Forty days and forty nights
			the rain would fall till the waters covered the face of the earth. </p>
		<p>It might be. Why not? </p>
		<p>—<emph>Hell has enlarged its soul and opened its mouth without
			any limits</emph> - words taken, my dear little brothers in Christ
			Jesus, from the book of Isaias, fifth chapter, fourteenth verse.
			In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy
			Ghost. Amen. </p>
		<p>The preacher took a chainless watch from a pocket within
			his soutane and, having considered its dial for a moment in
			silence, placed it silently before him on the table. </p>
		<p>He began  to speak in a quiet tone. </p>
		<p>—Adam  and Eve, my dear boys, were, as you know, our
			first parents and you will remember that they were created by
			God in order that the seats in heaven left vacant by the fall of
			Lucifer and his rebellious angels might be filled again. Lucifer,
			we are  told, was a son of the morning, a radiant and mighty
			angel; yet he fell: he fell and there fell with him a third part of
			the host of heaven: he fell and was hurled with his rebellious
			angels into hell. What his sin was we cannot say. Theologians
			consider that it was the sin of pride, the sinful thought conceived
			in an instant: <emph>non serviam: I will not serve</emph>. That
			instant was his ruin. He offended the majesty of God by the
			sinful thought of one instant and God cast him out of heaven
			into hell for ever. </p>
		<p>—Adam and Eve were then created by God and placed in
			Eden, in the plain of Damascus, that lovely garden resplendent
			with sunlight and colour, teeming with luxuriant vegetation.
			The fruitful earth gave them her bounty: beasts and birds
			were their willing servants: they knew not the ills our flesh is
			heir to, disease and poverty and death: all that a great and
			generous God could do for them was done. But there was one
			condition imposed on them by God: obedience to His word.
			They were not to eat of the fruit of the forbidden tree. </p>
		<p>—Alas, my dear little boys, they too fell. The devil, once a
			shining angel, a son of the morning, now a foul fiend, came in
			the shape of a serpent, the subtlest of all the beasts of the field.
			He envied them. He, the fallen great one, could not bear to
			think that man, a being of clay, should possess the inheritance
			which he by his sin had forfeited for ever. He came to the
			woman, the weaker vessel, and poured the poison of his
			eloquence into her ear, promising her - O, the blasphemy of
			that promise! - that if she and Adam ate of the forbidden fruit
			they would become as gods, nay as God Himself. Eve yielded
			to the wiles of the archtempter. She ate the apple and gave it
			also to Adam who had not the moral courage to resist her.
			The poison tongue of Satan had done its work. They fell. </p>
		<p>—And then the voice of God was heard in that garden,
			calling His creature man to account: and Michael, prince of
			the heavenly host, with a sword of flame in his hand appeared
			before the guilty pair and drove them forth from Eden into the
			world, the world of sickness and striving, of cruelty and
			disappointment, of labour and hardship, to earn their bread in
			the sweat of their brow. But even then how merciful was God!
			He took pity on our poor degraded parents and promised that
			in the fulness of time He would send down from heaven One
			who would redeem them, make them once more children of
			God and heirs to the kingdom of heaven: and that One, that
			Redeemer of fallen man, was to be God's onlybegotten  Son,
			the Second Person of the Most Blessed Trinity, the Eternal
			Word. </p>
		<p>—He came. He was born of a virgin pure, Mary the virgin
			mother. He was born in a poor cowhouse in Judea and lived
			as a humble carpenter for thirty years until the hour of His
			mission had come. And then, filled with love for men, He went
			forth and called to men to hear the new gospel. </p>
		<p>—Did they listen? Yes, they listened but would not hear.
			He was seized and bound like a common criminal, mocked at
			as a fool, set aside to give place to a public robber, scourged
			with five thousand lashes, crowned with a crown of thorns,
			hustled through the streets by the jewish rabble and the Roman
			soldiery, stripped of his garments and hanged upon a
			gibbet and His side was pierced with a lance and from the
			wounded body of Our Lord water and blood issued continually. </p>
		<p>—Yet even then, in that hour of supreme agony, Our
			Merciful Redeemer had pity for mankind. Yet even there, on
			the hill of Calvary, He founded the holy catholic church
			against which, it is promised, the gates of hell shall not prevail.
			He founded it upon the rock of ages and endowed it with His
			grace, with sacraments and sacrifice, and promised that if men
			would obey the word of His church they would still enter into
			eternal life but if, after all that had been done for them, they
			still persisted in their wickedness there  remained for them an
			eternity of torment: hell. </p>
		<p>The preacher's voice sank. He paused, joined his palms for
			an instant, parted them. Then he resumed: </p>
		<p>—Now let us try for a moment to realise, as far as we can,
			the nature of that abode of the damned which the justice of an
			offended God has called into existence for the eternal punishment
			of sinners. Hell is a strait and dark and foulsmelling
			prison, an abode of demons and lost souls, filled with fire and
			smoke. The straitness of this prisonhouse is expressly designed
			by God to punish those who refused to be bound by
			His laws. In earthly prisons the poor captive has at least
			some liberty of movement, were it only within the four walls
			of his cell or in the gloomy yard of his prison. Not so in hell.
			There, by reason of the great number of the damned, the
			prisoners are heaped together in their awful prison, the walls
			of which are said to be four thousand miles thick: and the
			damned are so utterly bound and helpless that, as a blessed
			saint, saint Anselm, writes in his book on similitudes, they are
			not even able to remove from the eye a worm that gnaws it. </p>
		<p>—They lie in exterior darkness. For, remember, the fire of
			hell gives forth no light. As, at the command of God, the fire
			of the Babylonian furnace lost its heat but not its light so, at
			the command of God, the fire of hell, while retaining the
			intensity of its heat, burns eternally in darkness. It is a
			neverending storm of darkness, dark flames and dark smoke of
			burning brimstone, amid which the bodies are heaped one
			upon another without even a glimpse of air. Of all the plagues
			with which the land of the Pharaohs was smitten one plague
			alone, that of darkness, was called horrible. What name, then,
			shall we give to the darkness of hell which is to last not for
			three days alone but for all eternity? </p>
		<p>—The horror of this strait and dark prison is increased by
			its awful stench. All the filth of the world, all the offal and
			scum of the world, we are told, shall run there as to a vast
			reeking sewer when the terrible conflagration of the last day
			has purged the world. The brimstone too which burns there in
			such prodigious  quantity fills all hell with its intolerable
			stench; and the bodies of the damned themselves exhale such
			a pestilential odour that as saint Bonaventure says, one of
			them alone would suffice to infect the whole world. The very
			air of this world, that pure element, becomes foul and unbreathable
			when it has been long enclosed. Consider then
			what must be the foulness of the air of hell. Imagine some foul
			and putrid corpse that has lain rotting and decomposing in the
			grave, a jellylike mass of liquid corruption. Imagine such a
			corpse a prey to  flames, devoured by the fire of burning brimstone
			and giving off dense choking fumes of nauseous loathsome
			decomposition. And then imagine this sickening stench,
			multiplied a millionfold and a millionfold again from the
			millions upon millions of fetid carcasses massed together in
			the reeking darkness,  a huge and rotting human fungus. Imagine
			all this and you will have some idea of the horror of the
			stench of hell. </p>
		<p>—But this stench is not, horrible though it is, the greatest
			physical torment to which the damned are subjected. The
			torment of fire is the greatest torment to which the tyrant has
			ever subjected his fellowcreatures. Place your finger for a
			moment in the flame of a candle and you will feel the pain of
			fire. But our earthly fire was created by God for the benefit of
			man, to maintain in him the spark of life and to help him in
			the useful arts whereas the fire of hell is of another quality
			and was created by God to torture and punish the unrepentant
			sinner. Our earthly fire also consumes more or less rapidly
			according as the object which it attacks is more or less combustible
			so that human ingenuity has even succeeded in inventing
			chemical preparations to check or frustrate its action.
			But the sulphurous brimstone which burns in hell is a substance
			which is specially designed to burn for ever and for
			ever with unspeakable fury. Moreover our earthly fire destroys
			at the same time as it burns so that the more intense it is
			the shorter is its duration: but the fire of hell has this property
			that it preserves that which it burns and though it rages with
			incredible intensity it rages for ever. </p>
		<p>—Our earthly fire again, no matter how fierce or widespread
			it may be, is always of a limited extent: but the lake of
			fire in hell is boundless, shoreless and bottomless. It is on
			record that the devil himself, when asked the question by a
			certain soldier, was obliged to confess that if a whole mountain
			were thrown into the burning ocean of hell it would be
			burned up in an instant like a piece of wax. And this terrible
			fire will not afflict the bodies of the damned only from without
			but each lost soul will be a hell unto itself, the boundless
			fire raging in its very vitals. O, how terrible is the lot of those
			wretched beings! The blood seethes and boils in the veins, the
			brains are boiling in the skull, the heart in the breast glowing
			and bursting, the bowels a redhot mass of burning pulp, the
			tender eyes flaming like molten balls. </p>
		<p>—And yet what I have said as to the strength and quality
			and boundlessness of this fire is as nothing when compared to
			its intensity, an intensity which it has as being the instrument
			chosen by divine design for the punishment of soul and body
			alike. It is a fire which proceeds directly from the ire of God,
			working not of its own activity but as an instrument of divine
			vengeance. As the waters of baptism cleanse the soul with the
			body so do the fires of punishment torture the spirit with the
			flesh. Every sense of the flesh is tortured and every faculty of
			the soul therewith: the eyes with impenetrable utter darkness,
			the nose with noisome odours, the ears with yells and howls
			and execrations, the taste with foul matter, leprous corruption,
			nameless suffocating filth, the touch with redhot goads and
			spikes, with cruel tongues of flame. And through the several
			torments of the senses the immortal soul is tortured eternally
			in its very essence amid the leagues upon leagues of glowing
			fires kindled in the abyss by the offended majesty of the Omnipotent
			God and fanned into everlasting and ever increasing
			fury by the breath of the anger of the Godhead. </p>
		<p>—Consider finally that the torment of this infernal prison is
			increased by the company of the damned themselves. Evil
			company on earth is so noxious that even the plants, as if by
			instinct, withdraw from the company of whatsoever is deadly
			or hurtful to them. In hell all laws are overturned: there is no
			thought of family or country, of ties, of relationships. The
			damned howl and scream at one another, their torture and
			rage intensified by the presence of beings tortured and raging
			like themselves. All sense of humanity is forgotten. The yells
			of the suffering sinners fill the remotest corners of the vast
			abyss. The mouths of the damned are full of blasphemies
			against God and of hatred for their fellowsufferers and of
			curses against those souls which were their  accomplices in sin.
			In olden times it was the custom to punish the parricide, the
			man who had raised his murderous hand against his father, by
			casting him into the depths of the sea in a sack in which were
			placed a cock, a monkey and a serpent. The intention of those
			lawgivers who framed such a law, which seems cruel in our
			times, was to punish the criminal by the company of hateful
			and hurtful beasts. But what is the fury of those dumb beasts
			compared with the fury of execration which bursts from the
			parched lips and aching throats of the damned in hell when
			they behold in their companions in misery those who aided
			and abetted them in sin, those whose words sowed the
			first seeds of evil thinking and evil living in their minds, those
			whose immodest suggestions led them on to sin, those whose
			eyes tempted and allured them from the path of virtue. They
			turn upon those accomplices and upbraid them and curse
			them. But they are helpless and hopeless: it is too late now for
			repentance. </p>
		<p>—Last of all consider the frightful torment to those damned
			souls, tempters and tempted alike,  of the company of the
			devils. These devils will afflict the damned in two ways, by
			their presence and by their reproaches. We can have no idea
			of how horrible these devils are. Saint Catherine of Siena once
			saw a devil and she has written that, rather than look again for
			one single instant on such a frightful monster, she would
			prefer to walk until the end of her life along a track of red
			coals. These devils, who were once beautiful angels, have
			become as hideous and ugly as they once were beautiful. They
			mock and  jeer at the lost souls whom they dragged down to
			ruin. It is they, the foul demons, who are made in hell the
			voices of conscience. Why did you sin? Why did you lend an
			ear to the temptings of fiends? Why did you turn aside from
			your pious practices and good works? Why did you not shun
			the occasions of sin? Why did you not leave that evil companion?
			Why did you not give up that lewd habit, that impure
			habit? Why did you not listen to the counsels of your confessor?
			Why did you not, even after you had fallen the first or the
			second or the third or the fourth or the hundredth time, repent
			of your evil ways and turn to God who only waited for your
			repentance to absolve you of your sins? Now the time for
			repentance has gone by. Time is, time was, but time shall be
			no more! Time was to sin in secrecy, to indulge in that sloth
			and pride, to covet the unlawful, to yield to the promptings of
			your lower nature, to live like the beasts of the field, nay worse
			than the beasts of the field for they, at least, are but brutes
			and have not reason to guide them: time was but time shall be
			no more. God spoke to you by so many voices but you would
			not hear. You would not crush out that pride and anger in
			your heart, you would not restore those illgotten goods, you
			would not obey the precepts of your holy church nor attend to
			your religious duties, you would not abandon those wicked
			companions, you would not avoid those dangerous temptations.
			Such is the language of those fiendish tormentors, words
			of taunting and of reproach, of hatred and of disgust. Of
			disgust, yes! For even they, the very devils, when they sinned
			sinned by such a sin as alone was compatible with such angelical
			natures, a rebellion of the intellect: and they, even they,
			the foul devils must turn away, revolted and disgusted, from
			the contemplation of those unspeakable sins by which degraded
			man outrages and defiles the temple of the Holy Ghost,
			defiles and pollutes himself. </p>
		<p>—O, my dear little brothers in Christ, may it never be our
			lot to hear that language! May it never be our lot, I say! In the
			last day of terrible reckoning I pray fervently to God that not
			a single soul of those who are in this chapel today may be
			found among those miserable beings whom the Great Judge
			shall command to depart for ever from His sight, that not one
			of us may ever hear ringing in his ears the awful sentence of
			rejection: <emph>Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire
			which was prepared for the devil and his angels!</emph> </p>
		<p>He came down the aisle of the chapel, his legs shaking and
			the scalp of his head trembling as though it had been touched
			by ghostly fingers. He passed up the staircase and into the
			corridor along the walls of which the overcoats and waterproofs
			hung like gibbeted malefactors, headless and dripping
			and shapeless. And at every step he feared that he had already
			died, that his soul had been wrenched forth of the sheath of
			his body, that he was plunging headlong through space. </p>
		<p>He could not grip the floor with his feet and sat heavily at
			his desk, opening one of his books at random and poring over
			it. Every word for him! It was true. God was almighty. God
			could call him now, call him as he sat at his desk, before he
			had time to be conscious of the summons. God had called
			him. Yes? What? Yes? His flesh shrank together as it felt the
			approach of the ravenous tongues of flames, dried up as it felt
			about it the swirl of stifling air. He had died. Yes. He was
			judged. A wave of fire swept through his body: the first. Again
			a wave. His brain began to glow. Another. His brain was
			simmering and bubbling within the cracking tenement of the
			skull. Flames burst forth from his skull like a corolla, shrieking
			like voices: </p>
		<p>—Hell! Hell! Hell! Hell! Hell! </p>
		<p>Voices spoke near him: </p>
		<p>—On hell. </p>
		<p>—I suppose he rubbed it into you well. </p>
		<p>—You bet he did. He put us all into a blue funk. </p>
		<p>—That's what you fellows want: and plenty of it to make
			you work. </p>
		<p>He leaned back weakly in his desk. He had not died. God
			had spared him still. He was still in the familiar world of the
			school. Mr Tate and Vincent Heron stood at the window,
			talking, jesting, gazing out at the bleak rain, moving their
			heads. </p>
		<p>—I wish it would clear up. I had arranged to go for a spin
			on the bike with some fellows out by Malahide. But the roads
			must be kneedeep. </p>
		<p>—It might clear up, sir. </p>
		<p>The voices that he knew so well, the common words, the
			quiet of the classroom when the voices paused and the silence
			was filled by the sound of softly browsing cattle as the other
			boys munched their lunches tranquilly, lulled his aching soul. </p>
		<p>There was still time. O Mary, refuge of sinners, intercede
			for him! O Virgin Undefiled, save him from the gulf of death! </p>
		<p>The English lesson began with the hearing of the history.
			Royal persons, favourites, intriguers, bishops, passed like
			mute phantoms behind their veil of names. All had died: all
			had been judged. What did it profit a man to gain the whole
			world if he lost his soul? At last he had understood: and
			human life lay around him, a plain of peace whereon antlike
			men laboured in brotherhood, their dead sleeping under quiet
			mounds. The elbow of his companion touched him and his
			heart was touched: and when he spoke to answer a question
			of his master he heard his own voice full of the quietude of
			humility and contrition. </p>
		<p>His soul sank back deeper into depths of contrite peace, no
			longer able to suffer the pain of dread, and sending forth, as
			she sank, a faint prayer. Ah yes, he would still be spared; he
			would repent in his heart and be forgiven; and then those
			above, those in heaven, would see what he would do to make
			up for the past: a whole life, every hour of life. Only wait. </p>
		<p>—All, God! All, all! </p>
		<p>A messenger came to the door to say that confessions were
			being heard in the chapel. Four boys left the room; and he
			heard others passing down the corridor. A tremulous chill
			blew round his heart, no stronger than a little wind, and yet,
			listening and suffering silently, he seemed to have laid an ear
			against the muscle of his own heart, feeling it close and quail,
			listening to the flutter of its ventricles. </p>
		<p>No escape. He had to confess, to speak out in words what
			he had done and thought, sin after sin. How? How? </p>
		<p>—Father, I ... </p>
		<p>The thought slid like a cold shining rapier into his tender
			flesh: confession. But not there in the chapel of the college.
			He would confess all, every sin of deed and thought, sincerely:
			but not there among his school companions. Far away from
			there in some dark place he would murmur out his own
			shame: and he besought God humbly not to be offended with
			him if he did not dare to confess in the college chapel: and in
			utter abjection of spirit he craved forgiveness mutely of the
			boyish hearts about him. </p>
		<p>Time passed. </p>
		<p>He sat again in the front bench of the chapel. The daylight
			without was already failing and, as it fell slowly through the
			dull red blinds, it seemed that the sun of the last day was going
			down and that all souls were being gathered for the judgment. </p>
		<p>—<emph>I am cast away from the sight of Thine eyes:</emph> words
			taken, my dear little brothers in Christ, from the Book of
			Psalms, thirtieth chapter, twentythird verse. In the name of
			the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost. Amen. </p>
		<p>The preacher began to speak in a quiet friendly tone. His
			face was kind and he joined gently the fingers of each hand,
			forming a frail cage by the union of their tips. </p>
		<p>—This morning we endeavoured, in our reflection upon
			hell, to make what our holy founder calls in his book of spiritual
			exercises, the composition of place. We endeavoured, that
			is, to imagine with the senses of the mind, in our imagination,
			the material character of that awful place and of the physical
			torments which all who are in hell endure. This evening we
			shall consider for a few moments the nature of the spiritual
			torments of hell. </p>
		<p>—Sin, remember, is a twofold enormity. It is a base consent
			to the promptings of our corrupt nature to the lower instincts,
			to that which is gross and beastlike; and it is also a turning
			away from the counsel of our higher nature, from all that is
			pure and holy, from the Holy God Himself. For this reason
			mortal sin is punished in hell by two different forms of punishment,
			physical and spiritual. </p>
		<p>—Now  of all these spiritual pains by far the greatest is the
			pain of loss, so great, in fact, that in itself it is a torment
			greater than all the others. Saint Thomas, the greatest doctor
			of the church, the angelic doctor, as he is called, says that the
			worst damnation consists in this that the understanding of
			man is totally deprived of divine light and his affection obstinately
			turned away from the goodness of God. God, remember,
			is a being infinitely good and therefore the loss of such a
			being must be a loss infinitely painful. In this life we have not
			a very clear idea of what such a loss must be but the damned
			in hell, for their greater torment, have a full understanding of
			that which they have lost and understand  that they have lost it
			through their own sins and have lost it for ever. At the very
			instant of death the bonds of the flesh are broken asunder and
			the soul at once flies towards God. The soul tends towards
			God as towards the centre of her existence. Remember, my
			dear little boys, our souls long to be with God. We come from
			God, we live by God, we belong to God: we are His, inalienably
			His. God loves with a divine love every human soul and
			every human soul lives in that love. How could it be otherwise?
			Every breath that we draw, every thought of our brain,
			every instant of life proceed from God's inexhaustible goodness.
			And if it be pain for a mother to be parted from her
			child, for a man to be exiled from hearth and home, for friend
			to be sundered from friend, O think what pain, what anguish,
			it must be for the poor soul to be spurned from the presence
			of the supremely good and loving Creator Who has called that
			soul into existence from nothingness and sustained it in life
			and loved it with an immeasurable love. This, then, to be
			separated for ever from its greatest good, from God, and to
			feel the anguish of that separation, knowing full well that it is
			unchangeable, this is the greatest torment which the created
			soul is capable of bearing, <seg xml:lang="la">poena damni</seg>, the pain of loss. </p>
		<p>—The second pain which will afflict the souls of the damned
			in hell is the pain of conscience. Just as in dead bodies worms
			are engendered by putrefaction so in the souls of the lost there
			arises a perpetual remorse from the putrefaction of sin, the
			sting of conscience, the worm, as Pope Innocent the Third
			calls it, of the triple sting. The first sting inflicted by this
			cruel worm will be the memory of past pleasures. O what a dreadful
			memory will that be! In the lake of alldevouring flame the
			proud king will remember the pomps of his court, the wise but
			wicked man his libraries and instruments of research, the lover
			of artistic pleasures his marbles and pictures and other art
			treasures, he who delighted in the pleasures of the table his
			gorgeous feasts, his dishes prepared with such delicacy, his
			choice wines; the miser will remember his hoard of gold, the
			robber his illgotten wealth, the angry and revengeful and
			merciless murderers their deeds of blood and violence in
			which they revelled, the impure and adulterous the unspeakable
			and filthy pleasures in which they delighted. They will
			remember all this and loathe themselves and their sins. For
			how miserable will all those pleasures seem to the soul condemned
			to suffer in hellfire for ages and ages. How they will
			rage and fume to think that they have lost the bliss of heaven
			for the dross of earth, for a few pieces of metal, for vain
			honours, for bodily comforts, for a tingling of the nerves.
			They will repent indeed: and this is the second sting of the
			worm of conscience, a late and fruitless sorrow for sins committed.
			Divine justice insists that the understanding of those
			miserable wretches be fixed continually on the sins of which
			they were guilty and moreover, as saint Augustine points out,
			God will impart to them His own knowledge of sin so that sin
			will appear to them in all its hideous malice as it appears to
			the eyes of God Himself. They will behold their sins in all
			their foulness and repent but it will be too late and then they
			will bewail the good occasions which they neglected. This is
			the last and deepest and most cruel sting of the worm of
			conscience. The conscience will say: You had time and
			opportunity to repent and would not. You were brought up
			religiously by your parents. You had the sacraments and
			graces and indulgences of the church to aid you. You had the
			minister of God to preach to you, to call you back when you
			had strayed, to forgive you your sins, no matter how many,
			how abominable, if only you had confessed and repented. No.
			You would not. You flouted the ministers of holy religion, you
			turned your back on the confessional, you wallowed deeper
			and deeper in the mire of sin. God appealed to you, threatened
			you, entreated you to return to Him. O what shame, what
			misery! The Ruler of the universe entreated you, a creature
			of clay, to love Him Who  made you and to keep His law. No.
			You would not. And now, though you were to flood all hell
			with your tears if you could still weep, all that sea of repentance
			would not gain for you what a single tear of true repentance
			shed during your mortal life would have gained for you.
			You implore now a moment of earthly life wherein to repent:
			in vain. That time is gone: gone for ever. </p>
		<p>—Such is the threefold sting of conscience, the viper which
			gnaws the very heart's core of the wretches in hell so that filled
			with hellish fury they curse themselves for their folly and curse
			the evil companions who have brought them to such ruin and
			curse the devils who tempted them in life and now mock them
			and torture them in eternity and even revile and curse the
			Supreme Being Whose goodness and patience they scorned
			and slighted but Whose justice and power they cannot evade. </p>
		<p>—The next spiritual pain to which the damned are subjected
			is the pain of extension. Man, in this earthly life, though
			he be capable of many evils, is not capable of them all at once
			inasmuch as one evil corrects and counteracts  another just as
			one poison frequently corrects another. In hell on the contrary
			one torment, instead of counteracting another, lends it still
			greater force: and moreover as the internal faculties are more
			perfect than the external senses, so are they more capable of
			suffering. Just as every sense is afflicted with a fitting torment
			so is every spiritual faculty; the fancy with horrible images, the
			sensitive faculty with alternate longing and rage, the mind and
			understanding with an interior darkness more terrible even
			than the exterior darkness which reigns in that dreadful
			prison. The malice, impotent though it be, which possesses
			these demon souls is an evil of boundless extension, of limitless
			duration, a frightful state of wickedness which we can
			scarcely realise unless we bear in mind the enormity of sin and
			the hatred God bears to it. </p>
		<p>—Opposed to this pain of extension and yet coexistent with
			it we have the pain of intensity. Hell is the centre of evils and,
			as you know, things are more intense at their centres than at
			their remotest points. There are no contraries or admixtures of
			any kind to temper or soften in the least the pains of hell. Nay,
			things which are good in themselves become evil in hell.
			Company, elsewhere a source of comfort to the afflicted, will
			be there a continual torment: knowledge, so much longed for
			as the chief good of the intellect, will there be hated worse
			than ignorance: light, so much coveted by all creatures from
			the lord of creation down to the humblest plant in the forest,
			will be loathed intensely. In this life our sorrows are either not
			very long or not very great because nature either overcomes
			them by habits or puts an end to them by sinking under their
			weight. But in hell the torments cannot be overcome by habit.
			For while they are of terrible intensity they are at the same
			time of continual variety, each pain, so to speak, taking fire
			from another and reendowing that which has enkindled it with
			a still fiercer flame. Nor can nature escape from these intense
			and various tortures by succumbing to them for the soul is
			sustained and maintained in evil so that its suffering may be
			the greater. Boundless extension of torment, incredible intensity
			of suffering, unceasing variety of torture - this is what the
			divine majesty, so outraged by sinners, demands, this is what
			the holiness of heaven, slighted and set aside for the lustful
			and low pleasures of the corrupt flesh, requires, this is what the
			blood of the innocent Lamb of God, shed for the redemption
			of sinners, trampled upon by the vilest of the vile, insists upon. </p>
		<p>—Last and crowning torture of all the tortures of that awful
			place is the eternity of hell. Eternity! O, dread and dire word.
			Eternity! What mind of man can understand it? And, remember,
			it is an eternity of pain. Even though the pains of hell
			were not so terrible as they are yet they would become infinite
			as they are destined to last for ever. But while they are everlasting
			they are at the same time, as you know, intolerably
			intense,  unbearably extensive. To bear even the sting of an
			insect for  all eternity would be a dreadful torment. What must
			it be, then, to bear the manifold tortures of hell for ever? For
			ever! For all eternity! Not for a year or for an age but for ever.
			Try to imagine the awful meaning of this. You have often seen
			the sand on the seashore. How fine are its tiny grains! And
			how many of those tiny little grains go to make up the small
			handful which a child grasps in its play. Now imagine a mountain
			of that sand, a million miles high, reaching from the earth
			to the farthest heavens, and a million miles broad, extending
			to remotest space, and a million miles in thickness: and imagine
			such an enormous mass of countless particles of sand
			multiplied as often as there are leaves in the forest, drops of
			water in the mighty ocean, feathers on birds, scales on fish,
			hairs on animals, atoms in the vast expanse of the air: and
			imagine that at  the end of every million years a little bird came
			to that mountain and carried away in its beak a tiny grain of
			that sand. How many millions upon millions of centuries
			would pass before that bird had carried away even a square
			foot of that mountain, how many eons upon eons of ages
			before it had carried away all. Yet at the end of that immense
			stretch of time not even one instant of eternity could be said to
			have ended. At the end of all those billions and trillions of
			years eternity would have scarcely begun. And if that mountain
			rose again after it had been all carried away and if the
			bird came again and carried it all away again grain by grain:
			and if it so rose and sank as many times as there are stars in
			the sky, atoms in the air, drops of water in the sea, leaves on
			the trees, feathers upon birds, scales upon fish, hairs upon
			animals, at the end of all those innumerable risings and sinkings
			of that immeasurably vast mountain not one single instant
			of eternity could be said to have ended; even then, at the end
			of such a period, after that eon of time the mere thought of
			which makes our very brain reel dizzily, eternity would have
			scarcely begun. </p>
		<p>—A holy saint (one of our own fathers I believe it was)
			was once vouchsafed a vision of hell. It seemed to him that he
			stood in the midst of a great hall, dark and silent save for the
			ticking of a great clock. The ticking went on unceasingly; and
			it seemed to this saint that the sound of the ticking was the
			ceaseless repetition of the words: ever, never; ever, never.
			Ever to be in hell, never to be in heaven; ever to be shut off
			from the presence of God, never to enjoy the beatific vision;
			ever to be eaten with flames, gnawed by vermin, goaded with
			burning spikes, never to be free from those pains; ever to have
			the conscience upbraid one, the memory enrage, the mind
			filled with darkness and despair, never to escape; ever to curse
			and revile the foul demons who gloat fiendishly over the
			misery of their dupes, never to behold the shining raiment of
			the blessed spirits; ever to cry out of the abyss of fire to God
			for an instant, a single instant, of respite from such awful
			agony, never to receive, even for an instant, God's pardon;
			ever to suffer, never to enjoy; ever to be damned, never to be
			saved; ever, never; ever, never. O what a dreadful punishment!
			An eternity of endless agony, of endless bodily and spiritual
			torment, without one ray of hope, without one moment of
			cessation, of agony limitless in extent, limitless in intensity, of
			torment infinitely lasting, infinitely varied, of torture that
			sustains eternally that which it eternally devours, of anguish that
			everlastingly preys upon the spirit while it racks the flesh, an
			eternity, every instant of which is itself an eternity, and that
			eternity an eternity of woe. Such is the terrible punishment
			decreed for those who die in mortal sin by an almighty and
			a just God. </p>
		<p>—Yes, a just God! Men, reasoning always as men, are
			astonished that God should mete out an everlasting and
			infinite punishment in the fires of hell for a single grievous sin.
			They reason thus because, blinded by the gross illusion of the
			flesh and the darkness of human understanding, they are
			unable to comprehend the hideous malice of mortal sin. They
			reason thus because they are unable to comprehend that even
			venial sin is of such a foul and hideous nature that even if the
			omnipotent Creator could end all the evil and misery in the
			world, the wars, the diseases, the robberies, the crimes, the
			deaths, the murders, on condition that he allowed a single
			venial sin to pass unpunished, a single venial sin, a lie, an
			angry look, a moment of wilful sloth, He, the great omnipotent
			God, could not do so because sin, be it in thought or deed,
			is a transgression of His law and God would not be God if He
			did not punish the transgressor. </p>
		<p>—A sin, an instant of rebellious pride of the intellect, made
			Lucifer and a third part of the cohorts of angels fall from their
			glory. A sin, an instant of folly and weakness, drove Adam
			and Eve out of Eden and brought death and suffering into the
			world. To retrieve the consequences of that sin the Only
			Begotten Son of God came down to earth, lived and suffered
			and died a most painful death, hanging for three hours on the
			cross. </p>
		<p>—O, my dear little brethren in Christ Jesus, will we then
			offend that good Redeemer and provoke His anger? Will we
			trample again upon that torn and mangled corpse? Will we
			spit upon that face so full of sorrow and love? Will we too,
			like the cruel jews and the brutal soldiers, mock that gentle
			and compassionate Saviour Who trod alone for our sake the
			awful winepress of sorrow? Every word of sin is a wound in
			His tender side. Every sinful act is a thorn piercing His head.
			Every impure thought, deliberately yielded to, is a keen lance
			transfixing that sacred and loving heart. No, no. It is impossible
			for any human being to do that which offends so deeply
			the divine majesty, that which is punished by an eternity of
			agony, that which crucifies again the Son of God and makes
			a mockery of Him. </p>
		<p>—I pray to God that my poor words may have availed
			today to confirm in holiness those who are in a state of grace,
			to strengthen the wavering, to lead back to the state of grace
			the poor soul that has strayed if any such be among you. I
			pray to God, and do you pray with me, that we may repent of
			our sins. I will ask you now, all of you, to repeat after me the
			act of contrition, kneeling here in this humble chapel in the
			presence of God. He is there in the tabernacle burning with
			love for mankind, ready to comfort the afflicted. Be not
			afraid. No matter how many or how foul the sins if only you
			repent of them they will be forgiven you. Let no worldly
			shame hold you back. God is still the merciful Lord Who
			wishes not the eternal death of the sinner but rather that he be
			converted and live. </p>
		<p>—He calls you to Him. You are His. He made you out of
			nothing. He loved you as only a God can love. His arms are
			open to receive you even though you have sinned against Him.
			Come to Him, poor sinner, poor vain and erring sinner. Now
			is the acceptable time. Now is the hour. </p>
		<p>The priest rose and, turning towards the altar, knelt upon
			the step before the tabernacle in the fallen gloom. He waited
			till all in the chapel had knelt and every least noise was still.
			Then, raising his head, he repeated the act of contrition,
			phrase by phrase, with fervour. The boys answered him
			phrase by phrase. Stephen, his tongue cleaving to his palate,
			bowed his head, praying with his heart. </p>

	<div n="3.3" type="section">

		<p>He  went up to his room after dinner in order to be alone
			with his soul: and at every step his soul seemed  to sigh: at
			every step his soul mounted with his feet, sighing in the ascent,
			through a region of viscid gloom. </p>
		<p>He halted on the landing before the door  and then, grasping
			the porcelain knob, opened the door quickly. He waited in
			fear, his soul pining within him, praying silently that death
			might not touch his brow as he passed over the threshold,  that
			the fiends that inhabit darkness might not be given power over
			him. He waited still at the threshold  as at the entrance to some
			dark cave. Faces were there; eyes: they waited and watched. </p>
		<p>—We knew perfectly well of course that although it was
			bound to come to the light he would find considerable difficulty
			in endeavouring to try to induce himself to try to endeavour
			to ascertain the spiritual plenipotentiary and so we knew of
			course perfectly well - </p>
		<p>Murmuring faces waited and watched;  murmurous voices
			filled the dark shell of the cave. He feared intensely in spirit
			and in flesh but, raising his head bravely, he strode into the
			room firmly. A doorway, a room, the same room, same window.
			He told himself calmly that those words had absolutely
			no sense which had seemed to rise murmurously from the
			dark. He told himself that it was simply his room with the
			door open. </p>
		<p>He closed the door and, walking swiftly to the bed, knelt
			beside it and covered his face with his hands. His hands were
			cold and damp and his limbs ached with chill. Bodily unrest
			and chill and weariness beset him, routing his thoughts. Why
			was he kneeling there like a child saying his evening prayers?
			To be alone with his soul, to examine his conscience, to meet
			his sins face to face, to recall their times and manners and
			circumstances, to weep over them. He could not weep. He could
			not summon them to his memory. He felt only an ache of soul
			and body, his whole being, memory, will, understanding, flesh,
			benumbed and weary. </p>
		<p>That was the work of devils, to scatter his thoughts and
			overcloud his conscience, assailing him at the gates of the
			cowardly and sincorrupted flesh: and, praying God timidly to
			forgive him his weakness, he crawled up on to the bed and,
			wrapping the blankets closely about him, covered his face
			again with his hands. He had  sinned. He had sinned so deeply
			against heaven and before God that he was not worthy to be
			called God's child. </p>
		<p>Could it be that he, Stephen Dedalus, had done those
			things? His conscience sighed in answer. Yes, he had done
			them, secretly, filthily, time after time, and, hardened in sinful
			impenitence, he had dared to wear the mask of holiness before
			the tabernacle itself while his soul within was a living mass of
			corruption. How came it that God had not struck him dead?
			The leprous company of his sins closed about him, breathing
			upon him, bending over him from all sides. He strove to forget
			them in an act of prayer, huddling his limbs closer  together
			and binding down his eyelids: but the senses of his soul would
			not be bound and, though his eyes were shut fast, he saw the
			places where he had sinned and, though his ears were tightly
			covered, he heard. He desired with all his will not to hear or
			see. He desired till his frame shook under the strain of his
			desire and until the senses of his soul closed. They closed for
			an instant and then opened. He saw. </p>
		<p>A field of stiff weeds and thistles and tufted nettlebunches.
			Thick among the tufts of rank stiff growth lay battered canisters
			and clots and coils of solid excrement. A faint marshlight
			struggled upwards from all the ordure through the bristling
			greygreen weeds. An evil smell, faint and foul as the light,
			curled upwards sluggishly out of the canisters and from the
			stale crusted dung. </p>
		<p>Creatures were in the field; one, three, six: creatures were
			moving in the field, hither and thither. Goatish creatures with
			human faces, hornybrowed, lightly bearded and grey as indiarubber.
			The malice of evil glittered in their hard eyes, as they
			moved hither and thither, trailing their long tails behind them.
			A rictus of cruel malignity lit up greyly their old bony faces.
			One was clasping about his ribs a torn flannel waistcoat,
			another complained monotonously as his beard stuck in the
			tufted weeds. Soft language issued from their spittleless lips as
			they swished in slow circles round and round the field, winding
			hither and thither through the weeds, dragging their long tails
			amid the rattling canisters. They moved in slow circles, circling
			closer and closer to enclose, to  enclose, soft language
			issuing from their lips, their long swishing tails  besmeared
			with stale shite, thrusting upwards their terrific faces ... </p>
		<p>Help! </p>
		<p>He flung the blankets from him madly to free his face and
			neck. That was his hell. God had allowed him to see the hell
			reserved for his sins: stinking, bestial, malignant, a hell of
			lecherous goatish fiends. For him! For him! </p>
		<p>He sprang from the bed, the reeking odour pouring down
			his throat, clogging and revolting his entrails. Air! The air of
			heaven! He stumbled towards the window, groaning and
			almost fainting with sickness. At the washstand a convulsion
			seized him within; and, clasping his cold forehead wildly, he
			vomited profusely in agony. </p>
		<p>When the fit had spent itself he walked weakly to the window
			and, lifting the sash, sat in a corner of the embrasure and
			leaned his elbow upon the sill. The rain had drawn off; and
			amid the moving vapours from point to point of light the city
			was spinning about herself a soft cocoon of yellowish haze.
			Heaven was still and faintly luminous and the air sweet to
			breathe, as in a thicket drenched with showers: and amid
			peace and shimmering lights and quiet fragrance he made a
			covenant with his heart. </p>
		<p>He prayed: </p>
		<p>—<emph>He once had meant to come on earth in heavenly glory
			but we sinned: and then He could not safely visit us but with a
			shrouded majesty and a bedimmed radiance for He was God.
			So He came Himself in weakness not in power and He sent
			thee, a creature in His stead, with a creature's comeliness and
			lustre suited to our state. And now thy very face and form,
			dear mother, speak to us of the Eternal; not like earthly
			beauty, dangerous to look upon, but like the morning star
			which is thy emblem, bright and musical, breathing purity,
			telling of heaven and infusing peace. O harbinger of day! O
			light of the pilgrim! Lead us still as thou hast led. In the dark
			night, across the bleak wilderness guide us on to our Lord
			Jesus, guide us home.</emph> </p>
		<p>His eyes were dimmed with tears and, looking humbly up to
			heaven, he wept for the innocence he had lost. </p>
		<p>When evening had fallen he left the house and the first
			touch of the damp dark air and the noise of the door as it
			closed behind him made ache again his conscience, lulled by
			prayer and tears. Confess! Confess! It was not enough to lull
			the conscience with a tear and a prayer. He had to kneel
			before the minister of the Holy Ghost and tell over his hidden
			sins truly and repentantly. Before he heard again the footboard
			of the housedoor trail over the threshold  as it opened to
			let him in, before he saw again the table in the kitchen set for
			supper he would have knelt and confessed. It was quite simple. </p>
		<p>The ache of conscience ceased and he walked onward
			swiftly through the dark streets. There were so many flagstones
			on the footpath of that street and so many streets in that
			city and so many cities in the world. Yet eternity had no end.
			He was in mortal sin. Even once was a mortal sin. It could
			happen in an instant. But how so quickly? By seeing or by
			thinking of seeing. The eyes see the thing, without having
			wished first to see. Then in an instant it happens. But does
			that part of the body understand or what? The serpent, the
			most subtle beast of the field. It must understand when it
			desires in one instant and then prolongs its own desire instant
			after instant, sinfully. It feels and understands and desires.
			What a horrible thing! Who made it to be like that, a bestial
			part of the body able to understand bestially and desire
			bestially? Was that then he or an inhuman thing moved by a
			lower soul than his soul? His soul sickened at the thought of a
			torpid snaky life feeding itself out of the tender marrow of his
			life and fattening upon the slime of lust. O why was that so? O
			why? </p>
		<p>He cowered in the shadow of the thought, abasing himself
			in the awe of God  Who had made all things and all men.
			Madness. Who could think such a thought? And, cowering in
			darkness and abject, he prayed mutely to his angel guardian to
			drive away with his sword the demon that was whispering to
			his brain. </p>
		<p>The whisper ceased and he knew then clearly that his own
			soul had sinned in thought and word and deed wilfully
			through his own body. Confess! He had to confess every sin.
			How could he utter in words to the priest what he had done?
			Must, must. Or how could he explain without dying of
			shame? Or how could he have done such things without
			shame? A madman, a loathsome madman! Confess! O he
			would indeed to be free and sinless again! Perhaps the priest
			would know. O dear God! </p>
		<p>He walked on and on through illlit  streets, fearing to stand
			still for a moment lest it might seem that he held back from
			what awaited him, fearing to arrive at that towards which he
			still turned with longing. How beautiful must be a soul in the
			state of grace when God looked upon it with love! </p>
		<p>Frowsy girls sat along the curbstones before their baskets.
			Their dank hair hung trailed  over their brows. They
			were not beautiful to see as they crouched in the mire. But
			their souls were seen by God; and if their souls were in a state
			of grace they were radiant to see: and God loved them, seeing
			them. </p>
		<p>A wasting breath of humiliation blew bleakly over his soul
			to think of how he had fallen, to feel that those souls were
			dearer to God than his. The wind blew over him and passed
			on to the myriads and myriads of other souls on whom God's
			favour shone now  more and now less, stars now brighter and
			now dimmer, sustained  and failing. And the glimmering souls
			passed away, sustained and failing, merged in a moving
			breath. One soul was lost; a tiny soul: his. It flickered once
			and went out, forgotten, lost. The end: black cold void waste. </p>
		<p>Consciousness of place came ebbing back to him slowly
			over a vast tract of time unlit, unfelt, unlived. The squalid
			scene composed itself around him; the common accents, the
			burning gasjets in the shops, odours of fish and spirits and wet
			sawdust, moving men and women. An old woman was about
			to cross the street, an oilcan in her hand. He bent down and
			asked her was there a chapel near. </p>
		<p>—A chapel, sir? Yes, sir. Church Street chapel. </p>
		<p>—Church? </p>
		<p>She  shifted the can to her other hand and directed him:
			and, as she held out her reeking withered right hand under its
			fringe of shawl, he bent lower towards her, saddened and
			soothed by her voice. </p>
		<p>—Thank you. </p>
		<p>—You are quite  welcome, sir. </p>
		<p>The candles on the high altar had been extinguished but the
			fragrance of incense still floated down the dim nave. Bearded
			workmen with pious faces were guiding a canopy out through
			a sidedoor, the sacristan aiding them with quiet gestures and
			words. A few of the faithful still lingered, praying before one
			of the sidealtars or kneeling in the benches near the confessionals.
			He approached timidly and knelt at the last bench in
			the body, thankful for the peace and silence and fragrant
			shadow of the church. The board on which he knelt was
			narrow and worn and those who knelt near him were humble
			followers of Jesus. Jesus too had been born in poverty and had
			worked in the shop of a carpenter, cutting boards and planing
			them, and had first spoken of the kingdom of God to poor
			fishermen, teaching all men to be meek and humble of heart. </p>
		<p>He bowed his head upon his hands, bidding his heart be
			meek and humble that he might be like those who knelt beside
			him and his prayer as acceptable as theirs. He prayed beside
			them but it was hard. His soul was foul with sin and he dared
			not ask forgiveness with the simple trust of those whom Jesus,
			in the mysterious ways of God, had called first to His side, the
			carpenters, the fishermen, poor and simple people  following a
			lowly trade, handling and shaping the wood of trees, mending
			their nets with patience. </p>
		<p>A tall figure came down the aisle and the penitents stirred:
			and at the last moment, glancing up swiftly, he saw a long grey
			beard and the brown habit of a capuchin. The priest entered
			the box and was hidden. Two penitents rose and entered the
			confessional at either side. The wooden slide was drawn back
			and the faint murmur of a voice troubled the silence. </p>
		<p>His blood began to murmur in his veins, murmuring like a
			sinful city summoned from its sleep to hear its doom. Little
			flakes of fire fell and powdery ashes fell softly, alighting on the
			houses of men. They stirred, waking from sleep, troubled by
			the heated air. </p>
		<p>The slide was shot back. The penitent emerged from the
			side of the box. The farther slide was drawn. A woman entered
			quietly and deftly where the first penitent had knelt. The
			faint murmur began again. </p>
		<p>He could still leave the chapel. He could stand up, put one
			foot before the other and walk out softly and then run, run,
			run swiftly through the dark streets. He could still escape from
			the shame. Had it been any terrible crime but that one sin! Had
			it been murder! Little fiery flakes fell and touched him at all
			points, shameful thoughts, shameful words, shameful acts.
			Shame covered him wholly like fine glowing ashes falling
			continually. To say it in words! His soul, stifling and helpless,
			would cease to be. </p>
		<p>The slide was shot back. A penitent emerged from the
			farther side of the box. The near slide was drawn. A penitent
			entered where the other penitent had come out. A soft whispering
			noise floated in vaporous cloudlets out of the box. It
			was the woman: soft whispering cloudlets, soft whispering
			vapour, whispering and vanishing. </p>
		<p>He beat his breast with his fist humbly, secretly under cover
			of the wooden armrest. He would be at one with others and
			with God. He would love his neighbour. He would love God
			who had made and loved him. He would kneel and pray with
			others and be happy. God would look down on him and on
			them and would love them all. </p>
		<p>It was easy to be good. God's yoke was sweet and light. It
			was better never to have sinned, to have remained always a
			child, for God loved little children and suffered them to come
			to Him. It was a terrible and a sad thing to sin. But God was
			merciful to poor sinners who were truly sorry. How true that
			was! That was indeed goodness. </p>
		<p>The slide was shot to suddenly. The penitent came out. He
			was next. He stood up in terror and walked blindly into the
			box. </p>
		<p>At last it had come. He knelt in the silent gloom and raised
			his eyes to the white crucifix suspended above him. God
			could see that he was sorry. He would tell all his sins. His
			confession would be long, long. Everybody in the chapel
			would know then what a sinner he had been. Let them know.
			It was true. But God had promised to forgive him if he was
			sorry. He was sorry. He clasped his hands and raised them
			towards the white form, praying with his darkened eyes,
			praying with all his trembling body, swaying his head to and
			fro like a lost creature, praying with whimpering lips. </p>
		<p>—Sorry! Sorry! O sorry! </p>
		<p>The slide clicked back and his heart bounded in his breast.
			The face of an old priest was at the grating, averted from him,
			leaning upon a hand. He made the sign of the cross and
			prayed of the priest to bless him for he had sinned. Then,
			bowing his head, he repeated the <seg xml:lang="la">></seg> in fright. At the
			words <emph>my most grievous fault</emph> he ceased, breathless. </p>
		<p>—How long is it since your last confession, my child? </p>
		<p>—A long time, father. </p>
		<p>—A month, my child? </p>
		<p>—Longer, father. </p>
		<p>—Three months, my child? </p>
		<p>—Longer, father. </p>
		<p>—Six months? </p>
		<p>—Eight months, father. </p>
		<p>He had begun. The priest asked: </p>
		<p>—And what do you remember since that time? </p>
		<p>He began to confess his sins: masses missed,  prayers not
			said, lies. </p>
		<p>—Anything else, my child? </p>
		<p>Sins of anger, envy of  others, gluttony, vanity, disobedience. </p>
		<p>—Anything else, my child? </p>
		<p>—Sloth. </p>
		<p>—Anything else, my child? </p>
		<p>There was no help. He murmured: </p>
		<p>—I ... committed sins of impurity, father. </p>
		<p>The priest did not turn his head. </p>
		<p>—With yourself, my child? </p>
		<p>—And ... with others. </p>
		<p>—With women, my child? </p>
		<p>—Yes, father. </p>
		<p>—Were  they married women, my child? </p>
		<p>He did not know. His sins trickled from his lips, one by one,
			trickled in shameful drops from his soul festering and oozing
			like a sore, a squalid stream of vice. The last sins oozed
			forth, sluggish, filthy. There was no more to tell. He bowed his
			head, overcome. </p>
		<p>The priest was silent. Then he asked: </p>
		<p>—How old are you, my child? </p>
		<p>—Sixteen, father. </p>
		<p>The priest passed his hand several times over his face.
			Then, resting his forehead against his hand, he leaned towards
			the grating and, with eyes still averted, spoke slowly. His voice
			was weary and old. </p>
		<p>—You are very young, my child, he said, and let me implore
			of you to give up that sin. It is a terrible sin. It kills the
			body and it kills the soul. It is the cause of many crimes and
			misfortunes. Give it up, my child, for God's sake. It is
			dishonourable and unmanly. You cannot know where that wretched
			habit will lead you or where it will come against you. As long
			as you commit that sin, my poor child, you will never be worth
			one farthing to God. Pray to our mother Mary to help you.
			She will help you, my child. Pray to Our Blessed Lady when
			that sin comes into  your mind. I am sure you will do that, will
			you not? You repent of all those sins. I am sure you do. And
			you will promise God now that by His holy grace you will
			never offend Him any more by that wicked sin. You will make
			that solemn promise to God, will you not? </p>
		<p>—Yes, father. </p>
		<p>The old and weary voice fell like sweet rain upon his quaking
			parching heart. How sweet and sad! </p>
		<p>—Do so, my poor child. The devil has  led you astray. Drive
			him back to hell when he tempts you to dishonour your body
			in that way - the foul spirit who hates Our Lord. Promise God
			now that you will give up that sin, that wretched wretched sin. </p>
		<p>Blinded by his tears and by the light of God's mercifulness
			he bent his head and heard the grave words of absolution
			spoken and saw the priest's hand raised above him in token
			of forgiveness. </p>
		<p>—God bless you, my child. Pray for me. </p>
		<p>He knelt to say his penance, praying in a corner of the dark
			nave: and his prayers ascended to heaven from his purified
			heart like perfume streaming upwards from a heart of white
			rose. </p>
		<p>The  muddy streets were gay. He strode homeward, conscious
			of an  invisible grace pervading and making light his
			limbs. In spite of all he had done it. He had confessed and
			God had pardoned him. His soul was made fair and holy once
			more, holy and happy. </p>
		<p>It would be beautiful to die if God so willed. It was beautiful
			to live if God so willed, to live in grace a life of peace and
			virtue and forbearance with others. </p>
		<p>He sat by the fire in the kitchen, not daring to speak for
			happiness. Till that moment he had not known how beautiful
			and peaceful life could be. The green square of paper pinned
			round the lamp cast down a tender shade. On the dresser was
			a plate of sausages and white pudding and on the shelf there
			were eggs. They would be for the breakfast in the morning
			after the communion in the college chapel. White pudding and
			eggs and sausages and cups of tea. How simple and beautiful
			was life after all! And life lay all before him. </p>
		<p>In a dream he fell asleep. In a dream he rose and saw that it
			was morning. In a waking dream he went through the quiet
			morning  towards the college. </p>
		<p>The boys were all there, kneeling in their places. He knelt
			among them, happy and shy. The altar was heaped with
			fragrant masses of white flowers: and in the morning light the
			pale flames of the candles among the white flowers were clear
			and silent as his own soul. </p>
		<p>He knelt before the altar with his classmates, holding the
			altar cloth with them over a living rail of hands. His hands
			were trembling, and his soul trembled as he heard the priest
			pass with the ciborium from communicant to communicant. </p>

		<p>—<seg xml:lang="la">Corpus Domini nostri.</seg></p>

		<p>Could it be? He knelt there sinless and timid: and he would
			hold upon his tongue the host and God would enter his
			purified body. </p>
		<p>—<seg xml:lang="la">In vitam eternam. Amen.</seg> </p>
		<p>Another life! A life of grace and virtue and happiness! It
			was true. It was not a dream from which he would wake.  The
			past was past. </p>
		<p>—<seg xml:lang="la">Corpus Domini nostri.</seg> </p>
		<p>The ciborium had come to him. </p>

		<p>Sunday was dedicated to the mystery of the Holy
			Trinity, Monday to the Holy Ghost, Tuesday to the
			Guardian Angels, Wednesday to Saint Joseph, Thursday to
			the Most Blessed Sacrament of the Altar, Friday to the
			Suffering Jesus, Saturday to the Blessed Virgin Mary. </p>
		<p>Every morning he hallowed himself anew in the presence of
			some holy image or mystery. His day began with an heroic
			offering of its every moment of thought or action for the
			intentions of the sovereign pontiff and with an early mass. The
			raw morning air whetted his resolute piety; and often as he
			knelt among the few worshippers at the sidealtar, following
			with his interleaved prayerbook the murmur of the priest, he
			glanced up for an instant towards the vested figure standing in
			the gloom between the two candles which were the old and the
			new testaments and imagined that he was kneeling at mass in
			the catacombs. </p>
		<p>His daily life was laid out in devotional areas. By means of
			ejaculations and prayers he stored up ungrudgingly for the
			souls in purgatory centuries of days and quarantines and
			years; yet the spiritual triumph which he felt in achieving with
			ease so many fabulous ages of canonical penances did not
			wholly reward his zeal of prayer since he could never know
			how much temporal punishment he had remitted by way of
			suffrage for the agonising souls: and, fearful lest in the midst
			of the purgatorial fire, which differed from the infernal only in
			that it was not everlasting, his penance might avail no more
			than a drop of moisture, he drove his soul daily through an
			increasing circle of works of supererogation. </p>
		<p>Every part of his day, divided by what he regarded now as
			the duties of his station in life, circled about its own centre of
			spiritual energy. His life seemed to have drawn near to eternity;
			every thought, word and deed, every instance of consciousness
			could be made to revibrate radiantly in heaven:
			and at times his sense of such immediate repercussion was so
			lively that he seemed to feel his soul in devotion pressing like
			fingers the keyboard of a great cash register and to see the
			amount of his purchase start forth immediately in heaven, not
			as a number but as a frail column of incense or as a slender
			flower. </p>
		<p>The rosaries too which he said constantly - for he carried
			his beads loose in his trousers' pockets that he might tell them
			as he walked the streets - transformed themselves into coronals
			of flowers of such vague unearthly texture that they
			seemed to him as hueless and odourless as they were nameless.
			He offered up each of his three daily chaplets that his
			soul might grow strong in each of the three theological virtues,
			in faith in the Father, Who had created him, in hope in the
			Son Who had redeemed him, and in love of the Holy Ghost
			Who had sanctified him, and this thrice triple prayer he offered
			to the Three persons through Mary in the name of her
			joyful and sorrowful and glorious  mysteries. </p>
		<p>On each of the seven days of the week he further prayed
			that one of the seven gifts of the Holy Ghost might descend
			upon his soul and drive out of it day by day the seven deadly
			sins which had defiled it in the past; and he prayed for each
			gift on its appointed day, confident that it would descend upon
			him, though it seemed strange to him at times that wisdom
			and understanding and knowledge were so distinct in their
			nature that each should be prayed for apart from the others.
			Yet he believed that at some future stage of his spiritual
			progress this difficulty would be removed when his sinful soul
			had been raised up from its weakness and enlightened by the
			Third Person of the Most Blessed Trinity. He believed this all
			the more, and with trepidation, because of the divine gloom
			and silence wherein dwelt the unseen Paraclete, Whose symbols
			were a dove and a mighty wind, to sin against Whom was
			a sin beyond forgiveness, the eternal, mysterious secret Being
			to Whom, as God, the priests offered up mass once a year,
			robed in the scarlet of the tongues of fire. </p>
		<p>The imagery through which the nature and kinship of the
			Three Persons of the Trinity were darkly shadowed forth in
			the books of devotion which he read - the Father contemplating
			from all eternity as in a mirror His Divine Perfections and
			thereby begetting eternally the Eternal Son and the Holy Spirit
			proceeding out of Father and Son from all eternity - were
			easier of acceptance by his mind by reason of their august
			incomprehensibility than was the simple fact that God had
			loved his soul from all eternity, for ages before he had been
			born into the world, for ages before the world itself had existed. </p>
		<p>He had heard the names of the passions of love and hate
			pronounced solemnly on the stage and in the pulpit, had found
			them set forth solemnly in books, and had wondered why his
			soul was unable to harbour them for any time or to force his
			lips to utter their names with conviction. A brief anger had
			often invested him but he had never been able to make it an
			abiding passion and had always felt himself passing out of it as
			if his very body were being divested with ease of some outer
			skin or peel. He had felt a subtle, dark and murmurous presence
			penetrate his being and fire him with a brief iniquitous
			lust: it too had slipped beyond his grasp leaving his mind lucid
			and indifferent. This, it seemed, was the only love and that the
			only hate his soul would harbour. </p>
		<p>But he could no longer disbelieve in the reality of love since
			God Himself had loved his individual  soul with divine love
			from all eternity. Gradually, as his soul was enriched with
			spiritual knowledge, he saw the whole world forming one vast
			symmetrical expression of God's power and love. Life became
			a divine gift for every moment and sensation of which, were it
			even the sight of a single leaf hanging on the twig of a tree, his
			soul should praise and thank the Giver. The world for all its
			solid substance and complexity no longer existed for his soul
			save as a theorem of divine power and love and universality.
			So entire and unquestionable was this sense of the divine
			meaning in all nature granted to his soul that he could scarcely
			understand why it was in any way necessary that he should
			continue to live. Yet that was part of the divine purpose and
			he dared not question its use, he above all others who had
			sinned so deeply and so foully against the divine purpose.
			Meek and abased by this consciousness of the one eternal
			omnipresent perfect reality his soul took up again her burden
			of pieties, masses and prayers and sacraments and mortifications,
			and only then for the first time since he had
			brooded on the great mystery of love did he feel within him a
			warm movement like that of some newly born life or virtue of
			the soul itself. The attitude of rapture in sacred art, the raised
			and parted hands, the parted lips and eyes as of one about to
			swoon, became for him an image of the soul in prayer, humiliated
			and faint before her Creator. </p>
		<p>But he had been forewarned of the dangers of spiritual
			exaltation and did not allow himself to desist from even the
			least or lowliest devotion,  striving also by constant mortification
			to undo the sinful past rather than to achieve a
			saintliness fraught with peril. Each of his senses was brought
			under a rigorous discipline. In order to mortify the sense of
			sight he made it his rule to walk in the street with downcast
			eyes, glancing neither to right nor left and never behind him.
			His eyes shunned every encounter with the eyes of women.
			From time to time also he balked them by a sudden effort of
			the will, as by lifting them suddenly in the middle of an
			unfinished sentence and closing the book. To mortify his
			hearing he exerted no control over his voice which was then
			breaking, neither sang nor whistled and made no attempt to
			flee from noises which caused him painful nervous irritation
			such as the sharpening of knives on the knifeboard, the
			gathering of cinders on the fireshovel and the twigging of the
			carpet. To mortify his smell was more difficult as he found in
			himself no instinctive repugnance to bad odours, whether they
			were the odours of the outdoor world such as those of dung
			and tar or the odours of his own person among which he had
			made many curious comparisons and experiments. He found
			in the end that the only odour against which his sense of smell
			revolted was a certain stale fishy stink like that of longstanding
			urine: and whenever it was possible he subjected himself to
			this unpleasant odour. To mortify the taste he practised strict
			habits at table, observed to the letter all the fasts of the church
			and sought by distraction to divert his mind from the savours
			of different foods. But it was to the mortification of touch that
			he brought the most assiduous ingenuity of inventiveness. He
			never consciously changed his position in bed, sat in the most
			uncomfortable positions, suffered patiently every itch and
			pain, kept away from the fire, remained on his knees all
			through the mass except at the gospels, left parts of his neck
			and face undried so that air might sting them and, whenever
			he was not saying his beads, carried his arms stiffly at his
			sides like a runner and never in his pockets or clasped behind
			him. </p>
		<p>He had no temptations to sin mortally. It surprised him
			however to find that at the end of his course of intricate piety
			and selfrestraint he was so easily at the mercy of childish and
			unworthy imperfections. His prayers and fasts availed him
			little for the suppression of anger at hearing his mother sneeze
			or at being disturbed in his devotions. It needed an immense
			effort of his will to master the impulse which urged him to give
			outlet to such irritation. Images of the outbursts of trivial
			anger which he had often noted among his masters, their
			twitching mouths, closeshut lips and flushed cheeks, recurred
			to his memory, discouraging him, for all his practice of humility,
			by the comparison. To merge his life in the common tide
			of other lives was harder for him than any fasting or prayer,
			and it was his constant failure to do this to his own satisfaction
			which caused in his soul at last a sensation of spiritual dryness
			together with a growth of doubts and  scruples. His soul traversed
			a period of desolation in which the sacraments themselves
			seemed to have turned into dried up sources. His
			confession became a channel for the escape of scrupulous and
			unrepented imperfections. His actual reception of the eucharist
			did not bring him the same dissolving moments of
			virginal selfsurrender as did those spiritual communions made
			by him sometimes at the close of some visit to the Blessed
			Sacrament. The book which he used for these visits was an old
			neglected book written by saint Alphonsus Liguori, with
			fading characters and sere foxpapered leaves. A faded world
			of fervent love and virginal responses seemed to be evoked for
			his soul by the reading of its pages in which the imagery of the
			canticles was interwoven with the communicant's prayers. An
			inaudible voice seemed to caress the soul, telling her names
			and glories, bidding her arise as for espousal and come away,
			bidding her look forth, a spouse, from Amana and from the
			mountains of the leopards; and the soul seemed to answer
			with the same inaudible voice, surrendering herself: <seg xml:lang="la">Inter
				ubera mea commorabitur</seg>. </p>
		<p>This idea of surrender had a perilous attraction for his mind
			now that he felt his soul beset once again by the insistent
			voices of the flesh which began to murmur to him again during
			his prayers and meditations. It gave him an intense sense of
			power to know that he  could by a single act of consent, in a
			moment of thought, undo all that he had done. He seemed to
			feel a flood slowly advancing towards his naked feet and to be
			waiting for the first faint timid noiseless wavelet to touch his
			fevered skin. Then, almost at the instant of that touch, almost
			at the verge of sinful consent, he found himself standing far
			away from the flood upon a dry shore, saved by a sudden act
			of the will or a sudden ejaculation: and, seeing the silver line
			of the flood far away and beginning again its slow advance
			towards his feet, a new thrill of power and satisfaction shook
			his soul to know that he had not yielded nor undone all. </p>
		<p>When he had eluded the flood of temptation many times in
			this way he grew troubled and wondered whether the grace
			which he had refused to lose was not being filched from him
			little by little. The clear certitude of his own immunity grew
			dim and to it succeeded a vague fear that his soul had really
			fallen unawares. It was with difficulty that he won back his old
			consciousness of his state of grace by telling himself that he
			had prayed to God at every temptation and that the grace
			which he had prayed for must have been given to him inasmuch
			as God was obliged to give it. The very frequency and
			violence of temptations showed him at last the truth of what
			he had heard about the trials of the saints. Frequent and
			violent temptations were a proof that the citadel of the soul
			had not fallen and that the devil raged to make it fall. </p>
		<p>Often when he had confessed his doubts and scruples, some
			momentary inattention at prayer, a movement of trivial anger
			in his soul or a subtle wilfulness in speech or act, he was
			bidden by his confessor to name some sin of his past life
			before absolution was given him. He named it with humility
			and shame and repented of it once more. It humiliated and
			shamed him to think that he would never be freed from it
			wholly, however holily he might live or whatever virtues or
			perfections he might attain. A restless feeling of guilt would
			always be present with him: he would confess and repent and
			be absolved, confess and repent again and be absolved again,
			fruitlessly. Perhaps that first hasty confession wrung from him
			by the fear of hell had not been good? Perhaps, concerned
			only for his imminent doom, he had not had sincere sorrow
			for his sin? But the surest sign that his confession had been
			good and that he had had sincere sorrow for his sin was, he
			knew, the amendment of his life. </p>
		<p>—I have amended  my life, have I not? he asked himself. </p>

		<p>The director stood in the embrasure of the window, his
			back to the light, leaning an elbow on the brown crossblind
			and, as he spoke and smiled, slowly dangling and looping the
			cord of the other blind. Stephen stood before him, following
			for a moment with his eyes the waning of the long summer
			daylight above the roofs or the slow deft movements of the
			priestly fingers. The priest's face was in total shadow but the
			waning daylight from behind him touched the deeply grooved
			temples and the curves of the skull. Stephen followed also
			with his ears the accents and intervals of the priest's voice as
			he spoke gravely and cordially of indifferent themes, the
			vacation which had just ended, the colleges of the order
			abroad, the transference of masters. The grave and cordial
			voice went on easily with its tale, and in the pauses Stephen
			felt bound to set it on again with respectful questions. He knew
			that the tale was a prelude and his mind waited for the sequel.
			Ever since the message of summons had come for him from
			the director his mind had struggled to find the meaning of the
			message; and during the long restless time he had sat in the
			college parlour waiting for the director to come in his eyes had
			wandered from one sober picture to another around the walls
			and his mind wandered from one guess to another until the
			meaning of the summons had almost become clear. Then, just
			as he was wishing that some unforeseen cause might prevent
			the director from coming, he had heard the handle of the door
			turning and the swish of a soutane. </p>
		<p>The director had begun to speak of the dominican and
			franciscan orders and of the friendship between saint Thomas
			and saint Bonaventure. The capuchin dress, he thought, was
			rather too  ... </p>
		<p>Stephen's face gave back the priest's indulgent smile and, not
			being anxious to give an opinion, he made a slight dubitative
			movement with his lips. </p>
		<p>—I believe, continued the director, that there is some talk
			now among the capuchins themselves of doing away with it
			and following the example of the other franciscans. </p>
		<p>—I suppose they would retain it in the cloister, said Stephen. </p>
		<p>—O, certainly, said the director. For the cloister it is all
			right but for the street I really think it would be better to do
			away with, don't you? </p>
		<p>—It must be troublesome, I imagine? </p>
		<p>—Of course it is, of course. Just imagine when I was in
			Belgium I used to see them out cycling in all kinds of weather
			with this thing up about their knees! It was really ridiculous.
			<seg xml:lang="fr">Les jupes</seg>, they call them in Belgium. </p>
		<p>The vowel was so modified as to be indistinct. </p>
		<p>—What do they call them? </p>
		<p>—<seg xml:lang="fr">Les jupes.</seg> </p>
		<p>—O. </p>
		<p>Stephen smiled again in answer to the smile which he could
			not see on the priest's shadowed face, its image or spectre only
			passing rapidly across his mind as the low discreet accent fell
			upon his ear. He gazed calmly before him at the waning sky,
			glad of the cool of the evening and the faint yellow glow which
			hid the tiny flame kindling upon his cheek. </p>
		<p>The names of articles of dress worn by women or of certain
			soft and delicate stuffs used in their making brought always to
			his mind a delicate and sinful perfume. As a boy he had imagined
			the reins by which horses are driven as slender silken
			bands and it shocked him to feel at Stradbrook the greasy
			leather of harness. It had shocked him too when he had felt
			for the first time beneath his tremulous fingers the brittle
			texture of a woman's stocking for, retaining nothing of all he
			read save that which seemed to him an echo or a prophecy of
			his own state, it was only amid softworded phrases or within
			rosesoft stuffs that he dared to conceive of the soul or body of
			a woman moving with tender life. </p>
		<p>But the phrase on the priest's lips was disingenuous for he
			knew that a priest should not speak lightly on that theme. The
			phrase had been spoken lightly with design and he felt that his
			face was being searched by the eyes in the shadow. Whatever
			he had heard or read of the craft of jesuits he had put aside
			frankly as not borne out by his own experience. His masters,
			even when they had not attracted him, had seemed to him
			always intelligent and serious priests, athletic and highspirited
			prefects. He thought of them as men who washed their bodies
			briskly with cold water and wore clean cold linen. During all
			the years he had lived among them in Clongowes and in
			Belvedere he had received only two pandies and, though these
			had been dealt him in the wrong, he knew that he had often
			escaped punishment. During all those years he had never
			heard from any of his masters a flippant word: it was they
			who had taught him christian doctrine and urged him to live a
			good life and, when he had fallen into grievous sin, it was they
			who had led him back to grace. Their presence had made him
			diffident of himself when he was a muff in Clongowes and it
			had made him diffident of himself also while he had held his
			equivocal position in Belvedere. A constant sense of this had
			remained with him up to the last year of his school life. He
			had never once disobeyed or allowed turbulent companions to
			seduce him from his habit of quiet obedience: and, even when
			he doubted some statement of a master, he had never presumed
			to doubt openly. Lately some of their judgments had
			sounded a little childish in his ears and had made him feel a
			regret and pity as though he were slowly passing out of an
			accustomed world and were hearing its language for the last
			time. One day when some boys had gathered round a priest
			under the shed near the chapel, he had heard the priest say: </p>
		<p>—I believe that Lord Macaulay was a man who probably
			never committed a mortal sin in his life, that is to say, a
			deliberate mortal sin. </p>
		<p>Some of the boys had then asked the priest if Victor Hugo
			were not the greatest French writer. The priest had answered
			that Victor Hugo had never written half so well when he had
			turned against the church as he had written when he was a
			catholic. </p>
		<p>—But there are many eminent French critics, said the
			priest, who consider that even Victor Hugo, great as he certainly
			was, had not so pure a French style as Louis Veuillot. </p>
		<p>The tiny flame which the priest's allusion had kindled upon
			Stephen's cheek had sunk down again and his eyes were still
			fixed calmly on the colorless sky. But an unresting doubt flew
			hither and thither before his mind. Masked memories passed
			quickly before him: he recognised scenes and persons yet he
			was conscious that he had failed to perceive some vital circumstance
			in them. He saw himself walking about the grounds
			watching the sports in Clongowes and eating slim jim out of
			his cricketcap. Some jesuits were walking round the cycletrack
			in the company of ladies. The echoes of certain expressions
			used in Clongowes sounded in remote caves of his mind. </p>
		<p>His ears were listening to these distant echoes amid the
			silence of the parlour when he became aware that the priest
			was addressing him in a different voice. </p>
		<p>—I sent for you today, Stephen, because I wished to speak
			to you on a very important subject. </p>
		<p>—Yes, sir. </p>
		<p>—Have you ever felt that you had a vocation? </p>
		<p>Stephen parted his lips to answer yes and then withheld the
			word suddenly. The priest waited for the answer and added: </p>
		<p>—I mean have you ever felt within yourself, in your soul, a
			desire to join the order. Think. </p>
		<p>—I have sometimes thought of it, said Stephen. </p>
		<p>The priest let the blindcord fall to one side and, uniting his
			hands, leaned his chin gravely upon them, communing with
			himself. </p>
		<p>—In a college like this, he said at length, there is one boy or
			perhaps two or three boys whom God calls to the religious
			life. Such a boy is marked off from his companions by his
			piety, by the good example he shows to others. He is looked
			up to by them; he is chosen perhaps as prefect by his fellow
			sodalists. And you, Stephen, have been such a boy in this
			college, prefect of Our Blessed Lady's sodality. Perhaps you
			are the boy in this college whom God designs to call to Himself. </p>
		<p>A strong note of pride reinforcing the gravity of the priest's
			voice made Stephen's heart quicken in response. </p>
		<p>—To receive that call, Stephen, said the priest, is the greatest
			honour that the Almighty God can bestow upon a man.
			No king or emperor on this earth has the power of the priest of
			God. No angel or archangel in heaven, no saint, not even the
			Blessed Virgin herself has the power of a priest of God: the
			power of the keys, the power to bind and to loose from sin,
			the power of exorcism, the power to cast out from the creatures
			of God the evil spirits that have power over them, the
			power, the authority, to make the great God of Heaven come
			down upon the altar and take the form of bread and wine.
			What an awful power, Stephen! </p>
		<p>A flame began to flutter again on Stephen's cheek as he
			heard in this proud address an echo of his own proud musings.
			How often had he seen himself as a priest wielding calmly and
			humbly the awful power of which angels and saints stood in
			reverence! His soul had loved to muse in secret on this desire.
			He had seen himself, a young and silentmannered priest,
			entering a confessional swiftly, ascending the altarsteps,
			incensing, genuflecting, accomplishing the vague acts of the
			priesthood which pleased him by reason of their semblance of
			reality and of their distance from it. In that dim life which he
			had lived through in his musings he had assumed the voices
			and gestures which he had noted with various priests. He had
			bent his knee sideways like such a one, he had shaken the
			thurible only slightly like such a one, his chasuble had swung
			open like that of such another as he had turned to the altar
			again after having blessed the people. And above all it had
			pleased him to fill the second place in those dim scenes of his
			imagining. He shrank from the dignity of celebrant because it
			displeased him to imagine that all the vague pomp should end
			in his own person or that the ritual should assign to him so
			clear and final an office. He longed for the minor sacred
			offices, to be vested with the tunicle of subdeacon at high
			mass, to stand aloof from the altar, forgotten by the people,
			his shoulders covered with a humeral veil, holding the paten
			within its folds, or, when the sacrifice had  been accomplished,
			to stand as deacon in a dalmatic of cloth of gold on the step
			below the celebrant, his hands joined and his face towards the
			people, and sing the chant <seg xml:lang="la">Ite, missa est</seg>. If ever he had seen
			himself celebrant it was as in the pictures of the mass in his
			child's massbook, in a church without worshippers, save for
			the angel of the sacrifice, at a bare altar and served by an
			acolyte scarcely more boyish than himself. In vague sacrificial
			or sacramental acts alone his will seemed drawn to go forth to
			encounter reality: and it was partly the absence of an appointed
			rite which had always constrained him to inaction
			whether he had allowed silence to cover his anger or pride or
			had suffered only an embrace he longed to give. </p>
		<p>He listened in reverent silence now to the priest's appeal
			and through the words he heard even more distinctly a voice
			bidding him approach, offering him secret knowledge and
			secret power. He would know then what was the sin  of Simon
			Magus and what the sin against the Holy Ghost for which
			there was no forgiveness. He would know obscure things,
			hidden from others, from those who  were conceived and born
			children of wrath. He would know the sins, the sinful longings
			and sinful thoughts and sinful acts, of others, hearing them
			murmured into his ears in the confessional under the shame of
			a darkened chapel by the lips of women and of girls: but
			rendered immune mysteriously at his ordination by the imposition
			of hands his soul would pass again uncontaminated to
			the white peace of the altar. No touch of sin would linger upon
			the hands with which he would elevate and break the host; no
			touch of sin would linger on his lips in prayer to make him eat
			and drink damnation to himself, not discerning the body of the
			Lord. He would hold his secret knowledge and secret power,
			being as sinless as the innocent: and he would be a priest for
			ever according to the order of Melchisedec. </p>
		<p>—I will offer up my mass tomorrow morning, said the
			director, that Almighty God may reveal to you His holy will.
			And let you, Stephen, make a novena to your holy patron
			saint, the first martyr, who is very powerful with God, that
			God may enlighten your mind. But you must be quite sure,
			Stephen, that you have a vocation because it would be terrible
			if you found afterwards that you had none. Once a priest
			always a priest, remember. Your catechism tells you that the
			sacrament of Holy Orders is one of those which can be received
			only once because it imprints on the soul an indelible
			spiritual mark which can never be effaced. It is before you
			must weigh well, not after. It is a solemn question, Stephen,
			because on it may depend the salvation of your eternal soul.
			But we will pray to God together. </p>
		<p>He held open the heavy hall door and gave his hand as if
			already to a companion in the spiritual life. Stephen passed
			out on to  the wide platform above the steps and was conscious
			of the caress of mild evening air. Towards Findlater's church a
			quartet of young men were striding along with linked arms,
			swaying their heads and stepping to the agile melody of their
			leader's concertina. The music passed in an instant, as the first
			bars of sudden music always did, over the fantastic fabrics of
			his mind, dissolving them painlessly and noiselessly as a
			sudden wave dissolves the sandbuilt turrets of children. Smiling
			at the trivial air he raised his eyes to the priest's face and,
			seeing in it a mirthless reflection of the sunken day, detached
			his hand slowly which had acquiesced  faintly in that companionship. </p>
		<p>As he descended the steps the impression which effaced his
			troubled selfcommunion was that of a mirthless mask
			reflecting a sunken day from the threshold of the college. The
			shadow, then, of the life of the college passed gravely over his
			consciousness. It was a grave and ordered and passionless life
			that awaited him, a life without material cares. He wondered
			how he would pass the first night in the novitiate and with
			what dismay he would wake the first morning in the dormitory.
			The troubling odour of the long corridors of Clongowes
			came back to him and he heard the discreet murmur of the
			burning gasflames. At once from every part of his being unrest
			began to irradiate. A feverish quickening of his pulses followed
			and a din of meaningless words drove his reasoned
			thoughts hither and thither confusedly. His lungs dilated and
			sank as if he were inhaling a warm moist unsustaining air and
			he smelt again the warm moist air which hung in the bath in
			Clongowes above the sluggish turfcoloured water. </p>
		<p>Some instinct, waking at these memories, stronger than
			education or piety, quickened within him at every near approach
			to that life, an instinct subtle and hostile, and armed
			him against acquiescence. The chill and order of the life
			repelled him. He saw himself rising in the cold of the morning
			and filing down with the others to early mass and trying vainly
			to struggle with his prayers against the fainting sickness of his
			stomach. He saw himself sitting at dinner with the community
			of a college. What, then, had become of that deeprooted
			shyness of his which had made him loth to eat or drink under
			a strange roof? What had come of the pride of his spirit which
			had always made him conceive himself as a being apart in every
			order? </p>
		<p>The Reverend Stephen Dedalus, S.J. </p>
		<p>His name in that new life leaped into characters before his
			eyes and to it there followed a mental sensation of an
			undefined face or colour of a face. The colour faded and
			became strong like a changing glow of pallid brick red. Was it
			the raw reddish glow he had so often seen on wintry mornings
			on the shaven gills of the priests? The face was eyeless and
			sourfavoured and devout, shot with pink tinges of suffocated
			anger. Was it not a mental spectre of the face of one of the
			jesuits whom some of the boys called Lantern Jaws and others
			Foxy Campbell? </p>
		<p>He was passing at that moment before the jesuit house in
			Gardiner Street, and wondered vaguely which window would
			be his if he ever joined the order. Then he wondered at the
			vagueness of his wonder, at the remoteness of his soul from
			what he had hitherto imagined her sanctuary, at the frail hold
			which so many years of order and obedience had of him when
			once a definite and irrevocable act of his threatened to end for
			ever, in time and in eternity, his freedom. The voice of the
			director urging upon him the proud claims of the church and
			the mystery and power of the priestly office repeated itself
			idly in his memory. His soul was not there to hear and greet it
			and he knew now that the exhortation he had listened to had
			already fallen into an idle formal tale. He would never swing
			the thurible  before the tabernacle as priest. His destiny was to
			be elusive of social or religious orders. The wisdom of the
			priest's appeal did not touch him to the quick. He was destined
			to learn his own wisdom apart from others or to learn
			the wisdom of others himself wandering among the snares of
			the world. </p>
		<p>The snares of the world were its ways of sin. He would fall.
			He had not yet fallen but he would fall silently, in an instant.
			Not to fall was too hard, too hard: and he felt the silent lapse
			of his soul, as it would be at some instant to come, falling,
			falling but not yet fallen, still unfallen but about to fall. </p>
		<p>He crossed the bridge over the stream of the Tolka and
			turned his eyes coldly for an instant towards the faded blue
			shrine of the Blessed Virgin which stood fowlwise on a pole in
			the middle of a hamshaped encampment of poor cottages.
			Then, bending to the left, he followed the lane which led up to
			his house. The faint sour stink of rotted cabbages came towards
			him from the kitchengardens on the rising ground
			above the river. He smiled to think that it was this disorder,
			the misrule and confusion of his father's house and the stagnation
			of vegetable life, which was to win the day in his soul.
			Then a short laugh broke from his lips as he thought of that
			solitary farmhand in the kitchengardens behind their house
			whom they had nicknamed the man with the hat. A second
			laugh, taking rise from the first after a pause, broke from him
			involuntarily as he thought of how the man with the hat
			worked, considering in turn the four points of the sky and then
			regretfully plunging his spade in the earth. </p>
		<p>He pushed open the latchless door of the porch and passed
			through the naked hallway into the kitchen. A group of his
			brothers and sisters was sitting round the table. Tea was
			nearly over and only the last of the second watered tea remained
			in the bottoms of the small glassjars and jampots
			which did service for teacups. Discarded crusts and lumps of
			sugared bread, turned brown by the tea which had been
			poured over them, lay scattered on the table. Little wells of
			tea lay here and there on the board and a knife with a broken
			ivory handle was stuck through the pith of a ravaged turnover. </p>
		<p>The sad quiet greyblue glow of the dying day came through
			the window and the open door, covering over and allaying
			quietly a sudden instinct of remorse in Stephen's heart. All
			that had been denied them had been freely given to him, the
			eldest: but the quiet glow of evening showed him in their faces
			no sign of rancour. </p>
		<p>He sat near them at the table and asked where his father
			and mother were. One answered: </p>
		<p>—Goneboro toboro lookboro atboro aboro houseboro. </p>
		<p>Still another removal! A boy named Fallon in Belvedere
			had often asked him with a silly laugh why they moved so
			often. A frown of scorn darkened quickly his forehead as he
			heard again the silly laugh of the questioner. </p>
		<p>He asked: </p>
		<p>—Why are we on the move again, if it's a fair question? </p>
		<p>The same sister answered: </p>
		<p>—Becauseboro theboro landboro lordboro willboro putboro
			usboro outboro. </p>
		<p>The voice of his youngest brother from the farther side of
			the fireplace began to sing the air <emph>Oft in the Stilly Night</emph>. One
			by one the others took up the air until a full choir of voices
			was singing. They would sing so for hours, melody after
			melody, glee after glee, till the last pale light died down on the
			horizon, till the first dark nightclouds came forth and night
			fell. </p>
		<p>He waited for some moments, listening, before he too took
			up the air with them. He was listening with pain of spirit to the
			overtone of weariness behind their frail fresh innocent voices.
			Even before they set out on life's journey they seemed weary
			already of the way. </p>
		<p>He heard the choir of voices in the kitchen echoed and
			multiplied through an endless reverberation of the choirs of
			endless generations of children: and heard in all the echoes an
			echo also of the recurring note of weariness and pain. All
			seemed weary of life even before entering upon it. And he
			remembered that Newman had heard this note also in the
			broken lines of Virgil <emph>giving utterance, like the voice of Nature
				herself, to that pain and weariness yet hope of better things
				which has been the experience of her children in every time.</emph></p>

		<p>He could wait no longer. </p>
		<p>From the door of Byron's publichouse to the gate of Clontarf
			Chapel, from the gate of Clontarf Chapel to the door of
			Byron's publichouse and then back again to the chapel and
			then back again to the publichouse he had paced slowly at
			first, planting his steps scrupulously in the spaces of the patchwork
			of the footpath, then timing their fall to the fall of verses.
			A full hour had passed since his father had gone in with Dan
			Crosby, the tutor, to find out for him something about the
			university. For a full hour he had paced up and down,
			waiting: but he could wait no longer. </p>
		<p>He set off abruptly for the Bull, walking rapidly lest his
			father's shrill whistle might call him back; and in a few moments
			he had rounded the curve at the police barrack and was
			safe. </p>
		<p>Yes, his mother was hostile to the idea, as he  had read from
			her listless silence. Yet her mistrust pricked him more keenly
			than his father's pride and he thought coldly how he had
			watched the faith which was fading down in his soul aging and
			strengthening in her eyes. A dim antagonism gathered force
			within him and darkened his mind as a cloud against her
			disloyalty:  and when it  passed, cloudlike, leaving his mind
			serene and dutiful towards her again, he was made aware
			dimly and without regret of a first noiseless sundering of their
			lives. </p>
		<p>The university! So he had passed beyond the challenge of
			the  sentries who had stood as guardians of his boyhood and
			had sought to keep him among them that he might be subject
			to them and serve their ends. Pride after satisfaction uplifted
			him like long slow waves. The end he had been born to serve
			yet did not see had led him to escape by an unseen path: and
			now it beckoned to him once more and a new adventure was
			about to be opened to him. It seemed to him that he heard
			notes of fitful music leaping upwards a tone and downwards a
			diminished fourth, upwards a tone and downwards a major
			third, like triplebranching flames leaping fitfully, flame after
			flame, out of a midnight wood. It was an elfin prelude, endless
			and formless; and, as it grew wilder and faster, the flames
			leaping out of time, he seemed to hear from under the boughs
			and grasses wild creatures racing, their feet pattering like rain
			upon the leaves. Their feet passed in pattering tumult over his
			mind, the feet of hares and rabbits, the feet of harts and hinds
			and antelopes, until he heard them no more and remembered
			only a proud cadence from Newman: <emph>Whose feet are as the
			feet of harts and underneath the everlasting arms.</emph> </p>
		<p>The pride of that dim image brought back to his mind the
			dignity of the office he had refused. All through his boyhood
			he had mused upon that which he had so often thought to be
			his destiny and when the moment had come for him to obey
			the call he had turned aside, obeying a wayward instinct. Now
			time lay between: the oils of ordination would never anoint
			his body. He had refused. Why? </p>
		<p>He turned seaward  from the road at  Dollymount and as he
			passed on to the thin wooden bridge he felt the planks shaking
			with the tramp of heavily shod feet. A squad of christian
			brothers was on its way back from the Bull and had begun to
			pass, two by two, across the bridge. Soon the whole bridge
			was trembling and resounding. The uncouth faces passed him
			two by two, stained yellow or red or livid by the sea, and as
			he strove to look at them with ease and indifference, a faint
			stain of personal shame and commiseration rose to his own
			face. Angry with himself he tried to hide his face from their
			eyes by gazing down sideways into the shallow swirling water
			under the bridge but he still saw a reflection therein of their
			topheavy silk hats, and humble tapelike collars and loosely
			hanging clerical clothes. </p>
		<p>—Brother Hickey. </p>
		<p>Brother Quaid. </p>
		<p>Brother MacArdle. </p>
		<p>Brother Keogh. </p>
		<p>Their piety would be like their names, like their faces, like
			their clothes, and it was idle for him to tell himself that their
			humble and contrite hearts, it might be, paid a far richer
			tribute of devotion than his had ever been, a gift tenfold more
			acceptable than his elaborate adoration. It was idle for him to
			move himself to be generous towards them, to tell himself that
			if he ever came to their gates, stripped of his pride, beaten and
			in beggar's weeds, that they would be generous towards him,
			loving him as themselves. Idle and embittering, finally,  to
			argue, against his own dispassionate certitude, that the commandment
			of love bade us not to love our neighbour  as ourselves
			with the same amount and intensity of love but to love
			him as ourselves with the same kind of love. </p>
		<p>He drew forth a phrase from his treasure and spoke it softly
			to himself: </p>
		<p>—A day of dappled seaborne clouds. </p>
		<p>The phrase and the day and the scene harmonised in a
			chord. Words. Was it their colours? He allowed them to glow
			and fade, hue after hue: sunrise gold, the russet and green of
			apple orchards, azure of waves, the greyfringed fleece of
			clouds. No, it was not their colours: it was the poise and
			balance of the period itself. Did he then love the rhythmic rise
			and fall of words better than their associations of legend and
			colour? Or was it that, being as weak of sight as he was shy of
			mind, he drew less pleasure from the reflection of the glowing
			sensible world through the prism of a language manycoloured
			and richly storied than from the contemplation of an inner
			world of individual emotions mirrored perfectly in a lucid
			supple periodic prose? </p>
		<p>He passed from the trembling bridge on to firm land again.
			At that instant, as it seemed to him, the air was chilled and
			looking askance towards the water he saw a flying squall
			darkening and crisping suddenly the tide. A faint click at his
			heart, a faint throb in his throat told him once more of how his
			flesh dreaded the cold infrahuman odour of the sea: yet he did
			not strike across the downs on his left but held straight on
			along the spine of rocks that pointed against the river's mouth. </p>
		<p>A veiled sunlight lit up faintly the grey sheet of water where
			the river was embayed. In the distance along the course of the
			slowflowing Liffey slender masts flecked the sky and, more
			distant still, the dim fabric of the city lay prone in haze. Like a
			scene on some vague arras, old as man's weariness, the image
			of the seventh city of christendom was visible to him across the
			timeless air, no older nor more weary nor less patient of subjection
			than in the days of the thingmote. </p>
		<p>Disheartened, he raised his eyes towards the slowdrifting
			clouds, dappled and seaborne. They were voyaging across the
			deserts of the sky, a host of nomads on the march, voyaging
			high over Ireland, westward bound. The Europe they had
			come from lay out there beyond the Irish Sea, Europe of
			strange tongues and valleyed and woodbegirt and citadelled
			and of entrenched and marshalled races. He heard a confused
			music within him as of memories and names which he was
			almost conscious of but could not capture even for an instant;
			then the music seemed to recede, to  recede, to recede: and
			from each receding trail of nebulous music there fell always
			one longdrawn calling note, piercing like a star the dusk of
			silence. Again! Again! Again! A voice from beyond the world
			was calling. </p>
		<p>—Hello, Stephanos! </p>
		<p>—Here comes The Dedalus! </p>
		<p>—Ao! ... Eh, give it over, Dwyer, I'm telling you or I'll
			give you a stuff in the kisser for yourself .... Ao! </p>
		<p>—Good man, Towser! Duck him! </p>
		<p>—Come along, Dedalus! Bous Stephanoumenos! Bous
			Stephaneforos! </p>
		<p>—Duck him! Guzzle him now, Towser! </p>
		<p>—Help! Help! ... Ao! </p>
		<p>He recognised their speech collectively before he distinguished
			their faces. The mere sight of that medley of wet
			nakedness chilled him to the bone. Their bodies, corpsewhite
			or suffused with a pallid golden light or rawly tanned by the
			suns, gleamed with the wet of the sea. Their divingstone,
			poised on its rude supports and rocking under their plunges,
			and the roughhewn stones of the sloping breakwater over
			which they scrambled in their horseplay, gleamed with cold wet
			lustre. The towels with which they smacked their bodies were
			heavy with cold seawater: and drenched with cold brine was
			their matted hair. </p>
		<p>He stood still in deference to their calls and parried their
			banter with easy words. How characterless they looked:
			Shuley without his deep unbuttoned collar, Ennis without his
			scarlet belt with the snaky clasp, and Connolly  without his
			Norfolk coat with the flapless sidepockets!  It was a pain to see
			them and a swordlike pain to see the signs of adolescence that
			made repellent their pitiable nakedness. Perhaps they had
			taken refuge in number and noise from the secret dread in
			their souls. But he, apart from them and in silence, remembered
			in what dread he stood of the mystery of his own body. </p>
		<p>—Stephanos Dedalos! Bous Stephanoumenos! Bous Stephaneforos! </p>
		<p>Their banter was not new to him and now it flattered his
			mild proud sovereignty. Now, as never before, his strange
			name seemed to him a prophecy. So timeless seemed the grey
			warm air, so fluid and impersonal his own mood, that all ages
			were as one to him. A moment before the ghost of the ancient
			kingdom of the Danes had looked forth through the vesture of
			the hazewrapped city. Now, at the name of the fabulous
			artificer, he seemed to hear the noise of dim waves and to see
			a winged form flying above the waves and slowly climbing the
			air. What did it mean? Was it a quaint device opening a page
			of some medieval book of prophecies and symbols, a hawklike
			man flying sunward above the sea, a prophecy of the end he
			had been born to serve and had been following through the
			mists of childhood and boyhood, a symbol of the artist forging
			anew in his workshop out of the sluggish matter of the
			earth a new soaring impalpable imperishable being? </p>
		<p>His heart trembled;  his breath came faster and a wild spirit
			passed over his limbs as though he were soaring sunward. His
			heart trembled in an ecstasy of fear and his soul was in flight.
			His soul was soaring in an air beyond the world and the body
			he knew was purified in a breath and delivered of incertitude
			and made radiant and commingled with the element of the
			spirit. An ecstasy of flight made radiant his eyes and wild his
			breath  and tremulous and wild and radiant his windswept
			limbs. </p>
		<p>—One! Two! ... Look out! </p>
		<p>—O, cripes, I'm drownded! </p>
		<p>—One! Two! Three and away! </p>
		<p>—Me next! Me next! </p>
		<p>—One! ... Uk! </p>
		<p>—Stephaneforos! </p>
		<p>His throat ached with a desire to cry aloud, the cry of a
			hawk or eagle on high, to cry piercingly of his deliverance to
			the winds. This was the call of life to his soul not the dull gross
			voice of the world of duties and despair, not the inhuman
			voice that had called him to the pale service of the altar. An
			instant of wild flight had delivered him and the cry of triumph
			which his lips withheld cleft his brain. </p>
		<p>—Stephaneforos! </p>
		<p>What were they now but cerements shaken from the
			body of death - the fear he had walked in night and day, the
			incertitude that had ringed him round, the shame that had
			abased him within and without - cerements, the linens of the
			grave? </p>
		<p>His soul had arisen from the grave of boyhood, spurning
			her graveclothes.  Yes! Yes! Yes! He would create proudly out
			of the freedom and power of his soul, as the great artificer
			whose name he bore, a living thing, new and soaring and
			beautiful, impalpable, imperishable. </p>
		<p>He started up nervously from the stoneblock for he could
			no longer quench the flame in his blood. He felt his cheeks
			aflame and his throat throbbing with song. There was a lust of
			wandering in his feet that burned to set out for the ends of the
			earth. On! On! his heart seemed to cry. Evening would deepen
			above the sea, night fall upon the plains, dawn glimmer before
			the wanderer and show him strange fields and hills and faces.
			Where? </p>
		<p>He looked northward towards Howth. The sea had fallen
			below the line of seawrack on the shallow side of the breakwater
			and already the tide was running out fast along the
			foreshore. Already one long oval bank of sand lay warm and
			dry amid the wavelets. Here and there warm isles of sand
			gleamed above the shallow tide, and about the isles and
			around the long bank and amid the shallow currents of the
			beach were lightclad gayclad figures, wading and delving. </p>
		<p>In a few moments he was barefoot, his stockings folded in
			his pockets and his canvas shoes dangling by their knotted
			laces over his shoulders: and, picking a pointed salteaten stick
			out of the jetsam among the rocks, he clambered down the
			slope of the breakwater. </p>
		<p>There was a long rivulet in the strand: and, as he waded
			slowly up its course, he wondered at the endless drift of seaweed.
			Emerald and black and russet and olive, it moved beneath
			the current, swaying and turning. The water of the
			rivulet was dark with endless drift and mirrored the highdrifting
			clouds. The clouds were drifting above him silently
			and silently the seatangle was drifting below him; and the grey
			warm air was still: and a new wild life was singing in his veins. </p>
		<p>Where was his boyhood now? Where was the soul that had
			hung back from her destiny, to brood alone upon the shame of
			her wounds and in her house of squalor and subterfuge to
			queen it in faded cerements and in wreaths that withered at
			the touch? Or where was he? </p>
		<p>He was alone. He was unheeded, happy and near to the
			wild heart of life. He was alone and young and wilful and
			wildhearted, alone amid a waste of wild air and brackish
			waters and the seaharvest of shells and tangle and veiled grey
			sunlight and gayclad lightclad figures, of children and girls and
			voices childish and girlish in the air. </p>
		<p>A girl stood before him in midstream, alone and still, gazing
			out to sea. She seemed like one whom magic had changed into
			the likeness of a strange and beautiful seabird. Her long slender
			bare legs were delicate as a crane's and pure save where an
			emerald trail of seaweed had fashioned itself as a sign upon
			the flesh. Her thighs, fuller and softhued as ivory, were bared
			almost to the hips where the white fringes of her drawers were
			like featherings of soft white down. Her slateblue skirts were
			kilted boldly about her waist and dovetailed behind her. Her
			bosom was as  a bird's soft and slight, slight and soft as the
			breast of some darkplumaged dove. But her long fair hair was
			girlish: and girlish, and touched with the wonder of mortal
			beauty, her face. </p>
		<p>She was alone and still, gazing out to sea; and when she felt
			his presence and the worship of his eyes her eyes turned to
			him in quiet sufferance of his gaze, without shame or wantonness.
			Long, long she suffered his gaze and then quietly withdrew
			her eyes from his and bent them towards the stream,
			gently stirring the water with her foot hither and thither. The
			first faint noise of gently moving water broke the silence, low
			and faint and whispering, faint as the bells of sleep; hither and
			thither, hither and thither: and a faint flame trembled on her
			cheek. </p>
		<p>—Heavenly God! cried Stephen's soul, in an outburst of
			profane joy. </p>
		<p>He turned away from her suddenly and set off across the
			strand. His cheeks  were aflame; his body was aglow; his limbs
			were trembling. On and on and on and on he strode, far out
			over the sands, singing wildly to the sea, crying to greet the
			advent of the life that had cried to him. </p>
		<p>Her image had passed into his soul for ever and no word
			had broken the holy silence of his ecstasy. Her eyes had called
			him and his soul had leaped at the call. To live, to err, to fall,
			to triumph, to recreate life out of life! A wild angel had appeared
			to him, the angel of mortal youth and beauty, an envoy
			from the fair courts of life, to throw open before him in an
			instant of ecstasy the gates of all the ways of error and glory.
			On and on and on and on! </p>
		<p>He halted suddenly and heard his heart in the silence. How
			far had he walked? What hour was it? </p>
		<p>There was no human figure near him nor any sound borne
			to him over the air. But the tide was near the turn and already
			the day was on the wane. He turned landward and ran towards
			the shore and, running up the sloping beach, reckless of the
			sharp shingle, found a sandy nook amid a ring of tufted sandknolls
			and lay down there that the peace and silence of the
			evening might still the riot of his blood. </p>
		<p>He  felt above him the vast indifferent dome and the calm
			processes of the heavenly bodies; and the earth beneath him,
			the earth that had borne him, had taken him to her breast. </p>
		<p>He closed his eyes in the languor of sleep. His eyelids
			trembled as if they felt the vast cyclic movement of the earth
			and her watchers, trembled as if they felt the strange light of
			some new world. His soul was swooning into some new world,
			fantastic, dim, uncertain as under sea, traversed by cloudy
			shapes and beings. A world, a glimmer, or a flower? Glimmering
			and trembling, trembling and unfolding, a breaking light,
			an opening flower, it spread in endless succession to itself,
			breaking in full crimson and unfolding and fading to palest
			rose, leaf by leaf and wave of light by wave of light, flooding
			all the heavens with its soft flushes, every flush deeper than
			other. </p>
		<p>Evening had fallen when he woke and the sand and arid
			grasses of his bed glowed no longer. He rose slowly and,
			recalling the rapture of his sleep, sighed at its joy. </p>
		<p>He climbed to the crest of the sandhill and gazed about
			him. Evening had fallen. A rim of the young moon cleft the
			pale waste of sky like the rim of a silver hoop embedded in
			grey sand; and the tide was flowing in fast to the land with a
			low whisper of her waves, islanding a few last figures in distant
			pools. </p>

		<p>He drained his third cup of watery tea to the dregs and
			set to chewing the crusts of fried bread that were scattered
			near him, staring into the dark pool of the jar. The
			yellow dripping had been scooped out like a boghole and the
			pool under it brought back to his memory the dark turfcoloured
			water of the bath in Clongowes. The box of pawn-tickets
			at his elbow had just been rifled and he took up idly
			one after another in his greasy fingers the blue and white
			dockets, scrawled and sanded and creased and bearing the
			name of the pledger as Daly or MacEvoy. </p>

		<p>1 Pair Buskins. </p>
		<p>1 D. Coat. </p>
		<p>3 Articles and White. </p>
		<p>1 Man's Pants. </p>

		<p>Then he put them aside and gazed thoughtfully at the lid of
			the box, speckled with lousemarks, and asked vaguely: </p>
		<p>—How much is the clock fast now? </p>
		<p>His mother straightened the battered alarmclock that was
			lying on its side in the middle of the kitchen mantelpiece until
			its dial showed a quarter to twelve and then laid it once more
			on its side. </p>
		<p>—An hour and twentyfive minutes, she said. The right time
			now is  twenty past ten. The dear knows you might try to be in
			time for your lectures. </p>
		<p>—Fill out the place for me to wash, said Stephen. </p>
		<p>—Katey, fill out the place for Stephen to wash. </p>
		<p>—Boody, fill out the place for Stephen to wash. </p>
		<p>—I can't, I'm going for blue. Fill it out, you, Maggie. </p>
		<p>When the enamelled basin had  been fitted into the well of
			the sink and the old washingglove flung on the side of it he
			allowed his mother to scrub his neck and root into the folds of
			his ears and into the interstices at the wings of his nose. </p>
		<p>—Well, it's a poor case, she said, when a university student
			is so dirty that his mother has to wash him. </p>
		<p>—But it gives you pleasure, said Stephen calmly. </p>
		<p>An earsplitting whistle was heard from upstairs and his
			mother thrust  a damp overall into his hands, saying: </p>
		<p>—Dry yourself and hurry out for the love of goodness. </p>
		<p>A second shrill whistle, prolonged angrily, brought one of
			the girls to the foot of the staircase. </p>
		<p>—Yes, father? </p>
		<p>—Is your lazy bitch of a brother gone out yet? </p>
		<p>—Yes, father. </p>
		<p>—Sure? </p>
		<p>—Yes, father. </p>
		<p>—Hm! </p>
		<p>The girl came back making signs  to him to be quick and go
			out quietly by the back. Stephen laughed and said: </p>
		<p>—He has  a curious idea of genders if he thinks a bitch is
			masculine. </p>
		<p>—Ah, it's a scandalous shame for you, Stephen, said his
			mother, and you'll live to rue the day you set your foot in that
			place. I know how it has changed you. </p>
		<p>—Good morning, everybody, said Stephen, smiling and
			kissing the tips of his fingers in adieu. </p>
		<p>The lane  behind the terrace was waterlogged and as he
			went down it slowly, choosing his steps amid heaps of wet
			rubbish, he heard a mad nun screeching in the nuns' madhouse
			beyond the wall. </p>
		<p>—Jesus! O Jesus! Jesus! </p>
		<p>He shook the sound out of his ears by an angry toss of his
			head and hurried on, stumbling through the mouldering offal,
			his heart already bitten by an ache of loathing and bitterness.
			His father's whistle, his mother's mutterings, the screech of an
			unseen maniac were to him now so many voices offending and
			threatening to humble the pride of his youth. He drove their
			echoes even out of his heart with an execration: but, as he
			walked down the avenue and felt the grey morning light falling
			about him through the dripping trees and smelt the strange
			wild smell of the wet leaves and bark, his soul was loosed of
			her miseries. </p>
		<p>The rainladen trees of the avenue evoked in him, as always,
			memories of the girls and women in the plays of Gerhart
			Hauptmann; and the memory of their pale sorrows and the
			fragrance falling from the wet branches mingled in a mood of
			quiet joy. His morning walk across the city had begun, and he
			foreknew that as he passed the sloblands of Fairview he would
			think of the cloistral silverveined prose of Newman, that as he
			walked along the North Strand Road, glancing idly at the
			windows of the provision shops, he would recall the dark
			humour of Guido Cavalcanti and smile, that as he went by
			Baird's stonecutting works in Talbot Place the spirit of Ibsen
			would blow through him like a keen wind, a spirit of wayward
			boyish beauty, and that passing a grimy marinedealer's shop
			beyond the Liffey he would repeat the song by Ben Jonson
			which begins: </p>
		<l><emph>I was not wearier where I lay.</emph> </l>
		<p>His mind, when wearied of its search for the essence of
			beauty amid the spectral words of Aristotle or Aquinas,
			turned often for its pleasure to the dainty songs of the Elizabethans.
			His mind, in the vesture of a doubting monk, stood
			often in shadow under the windows of that age, to hear the
			grave and mocking music of the lutenists or the frank laughter
			of waistcoateers until a laugh too low, a phrase, tarnished by
			time, of chambering and false honour, stung his monkish pride
			and drove him on from his lurkingplace. </p>
		<p>The lore which he was believed to pass his days brooding
			upon so that it had rapt him from the companionships of
			youth was only a garner of slender sentences from Aristotle's
			poetics and psychology and a <seg xml:lang="la">Synopsis Philosophiae Scholasticae ad mentem divi Thomae</seg>. His thinking was a dusk
			of doubt and selfmistrust lit up at moments by the lightnings of
			intuition, but lightnings of so clear a splendour that in those
			moments the world perished about his feet as if it had been
			fireconsumed: and thereafter his tongue grew heavy and he
			met the eyes of others with unanswering eyes for he felt that
			the spirit of beauty had folded him round like a mantle and
			that in revery at least he had been acquainted with nobility.
			But, when this brief pride of silence upheld him no longer, he
			was glad to find himself still in the midst of common lives,
			passing on his way amid the squalor and noise and sloth of the
			city fearlessly and with a light heart. </p>
		<p>Near the hoardings on the canal he met the consumptive
			man with the doll's face and the brimless hat coming towards
			him down the slope of the bridge with little steps, tightly
			buttoned into his chocolate overcoat,  and holding his furled
			umbrella a span or two from him like a diviningrod. It must
			be eleven, he thought, and peered into a dairy to see the time.
			The clock in the dairy told him that it was five minutes to five
			but, as he turned away, he heard a clock somewhere near him,
			but unseen, beating eleven strokes in swift precision. He
			laughed as he heard it for it made him think of MacCann and
			he saw him a squat figure in a shooting jacket and breeches
			and with a fair goatee, standing in the wind at Hopkins' corner,
			and heard him say: </p>
		<p>—Dedalus, you're an antisocial being, wrapped up in
			yourself. I'm not. I'm a democrat: and I'll work and act for
			social liberty and equality among all classes and sexes in the
			United States of the Europe of the future. </p>
		<p>Eleven! Then he was late for that lecture too. What day of
			the week was it? He stopped at a newsagent's to read the
			headline of a placard. Thursday.  Ten to eleven, English;
			eleven to twelve, French;  twelve to one, physics. He fancied to
			himself the English lecture and felt, even at that distance,
			restless and helpless. He saw the heads of his classmates
			meekly bent as they wrote in their notebooks the points they
			were bidden to note, nominal definitions, essential definitions
			and examples or dates of birth or death, chief works, a favourable
			and an unfavourable criticism side by side. His own
			head was unbent for his thoughts wandered abroad and
			whether he looked around the little class of students or out of
			the window across the desolate gardens of the green an odour
			assailed him of cheerless cellardamp and decay. Another head
			than his, right before him in the first benches, was poised
			squarely above its bending fellows like the head of a priest
			appealing without humility to the tabernacle for the humble
			worshippers about him. Why was it that when he thought of
			Cranly he could never raise before his mind the entire image
			of his body but only the image of the head and face? Even
			now against the grey curtain of the morning he saw it before
			him like the phantom of a dream, the face of a severed head or
			deathmask, crowned on the brows by its stiff black upright
			hair as by an iron crown. It was a priestlike face, priestlike in
			its pallor, in the widewinged nose, in the shadowings below the
			eyes and along the jaws, priestlike in the lips that were long
			and bloodless and faintly smiling: and Stephen, remembering
			swiftly how he had told Cranly of all the tumults and unrest
			and longings in his soul, day after day and night by night, only
			to be answered by his friend's listening silence, would have
			told himself that it was the face of a guilty priest who heard
			confessions of those whom  he had not  power to absolve but
			that he felt again in memory the gaze of its dark womanish
			eyes. </p>
		<p>Through this image he had a glimpse of a strange dark
			cavern of speculation but at once turned away from it, feeling
			that it was not yet the hour  to enter it. But the nightshade of
			his friend's listlessness seemed to be diffusing in the air around
			him a tenuous and deadly exhalation and he found himself
			glancing from one casual word to another on his right or left
			in stolid wonder that they had been so silently emptied of
			instantaneous sense until every mean shop legend bound his
			mind like the words of a spell and his soul shrivelled up, sighing
			with age as he walked on in a lane among heaps of dead
			language. His own consciousness of language was ebbing from
			his brain and trickling into the very words themselves which
			set to band and disband themselves in wayward rhythms: </p>
		<lg>
			<l>The ivy whines upon the wall </l>
			<l>And whines and twines upon the wall </l>
			<l>The ivy whines upon the wall </l>
			<l>The yellow ivy on the wall </l>
			<l>Ivy, ivy up the wall. </l>
		</lg>
		<p>Did any one ever hear such drivel? Lord Almighty! Who
			ever heard of ivy whining on a wall? Yellow ivy: that was all
			right. Yellow ivory also. And what about ivory ivy? </p>
		<p>The word now shone in his brain, clearer and brighter than
			any ivory sawn from the mottled tusks of elephants. <emph>Ivory,
				<seg xml:lang="fr">ivoire</seg>, <seg xml:lang="ita">avorio</seg>, <seg xml:lang="la">ebur</seg>.</emph> One of the first examples that he had
			learnt in Latin had run: <seg xml:lang="la">India mittit ebur</seg>; and he recalled the
			shrewd northern face of the rector who had taught him to
			construe the Metamorphoses of Ovid in a courtly English,
			made whimsical by the mention of porkers and potsherds and
			chines of bacon. He had learnt what little he knew of the laws
			of Latin verse from a ragged book written by a Portuguese
			priest. </p>
		<l><seg xml:lang="la">Contrahit orator, variant in carmine vates.</seg> </l>
		<p>The crises and victories and secessions in Roman history were
			handed on to him in the trite words <seg xml:lang="la">in tanto discrimine</seg> and he
			had tried to peer into the social life of the city of cities through
			the words <seg xml:lang="la">implere ollam denariorum</seg> which the rector had
			rendered sonorously as the filling of a pot with denaries.  The
			pages of his timeworn Horace never felt cold to the touch even
			when his own fingers were cold:  they were human pages: and
			fifty years before they had been turned by the human fingers
			of John Duncan Inverarity and by his brother, William Malcolm
			Inverarity. Yes, those were noble names on the dusky
			flyleaf and, even for so poor a Latinist as he, the dusky verses
			were as fragrant as though they had lain all those years in
			myrtle and lavender and vervain; but yet it wounded him to
			think that he would never be but a shy guest at the feast of the
			world's culture and that the monkish learning, in terms of
			which he was striving to forge out an esthetic philosophy, was
			held no higher by the age he lived in than the subtle and
			curious jargons of heraldry and falconry. </p>
		<p>The grey block of Trinity on his left, set heavily in the city's
			ignorance like a great dull stone set in a cumbrous ring, pulled
			his mind downward; and while he was striving this way and
			that to free his feet from the fetters of the reformed conscience
			he came upon the droll statue of the national poet of Ireland. </p>
		<p>He looked at it without anger: for, though sloth of the body
			and of  the soul crept over it like unseen vermin, over the
			shuffling feet and up the folds of the cloak and around the
			servile head, it seemed humbly conscious of its indignity. It
			was a Firbolg in the borrowed cloak of a Milesian; and he
			thought of his friend Davin, the peasant student. It was a
			jesting name between them but the young peasant bore with it
			lightly saying: </p>
		<p>—Go on, Stevie,  I have a hard head, you tell me. Call me
			what you will. </p>
		<p>The homely version of his christian name on the lips of his
			friend had touched Stephen pleasantly when first heard for he
			was as formal in speech with others as they were with him.
			Often, as he sat in Davin's rooms in Grantham Street, wondering
			at his friend's wellmade boots that flanked the wall pair by
			pair and repeating for his friend's simple ear the verses and
			cadences of others which were the veils of his own longing and
			dejection, the rude Firbolg mind of his listener had drawn his
			mind towards it and flung it back again, drawing it by a quiet
			inbred courtesy of attention or by a quaint turn of old English
			speech or by the force of its delight in rude bodily skill - for
			Davin had sat at the feet of Michael Cusack, the Gael -
			repelling swiftly and suddenly by a grossness of intelligence or
			by a bluntness of feeling or by a dull stare of terror in the eyes,
			the terror of soul of a starving Irish village in which the curfew
			was still a nightly fear. </p>
		<p>Side by side with his memory of the deeds of prowess of his
			uncle Mat Davin, the athlete, the young peasant worshipped
			the sorrowful legend of Ireland. The gossip of his fellowstudents
			which strove to render the flat life of the college
			significant at any cost loved to think of him as a young fenian.
			His nurse had taught him Irish and shaped his rude imagination
			by the broken lights of Irish myth. He stood towards this
			myth upon which no individual mind had ever drawn out a
			line of beauty and to its unwieldy  tales that divided themselves
			as they moved down the cycles in the same attitude as towards
			the Roman catholic religion, the attitude of a dullwitted loyal
			serf. Whatsoever of thought or of feeling came to him from
			England or by way of English culture his mind stood armed
			against in obedience to a password: and of the world that lay
			beyond England he knew only the foreign legion of France in
			which he spoke of serving. </p>
		<p>Coupling  this ambition with the young man's humour
			Stephen had often called him one of the tame geese: and there
			was even a point of irritation in the name pointed against that
			very reluctance of speech and deed in his friend which seemed
			so often to stand between Stephen's mind, eager of speculation,
			and the hidden ways of Irish life. </p>
		<p>One night the young peasant, his spirit stung by the violent
			or luxurious language in which Stephen escaped from the cold
			silence of intellectual revolt, had called up before Stephen's
			mind a strange vision. The two were walking slowly towards
			Davin's room through the dark narrow streets of the poorer
			jews. </p>
		<p>—A thing happened to myself, Stevie, last autumn, coming
			on winter, and I never told it to a living soul and you are the
			first person now I ever told it to. I disremember if it was
			October or November. It was October because it was before  I
			came up here to join the matriculation class. </p>
		<p>Stephen had turned his smiling eyes towards his friend's
			face, flattered by his confidence and won over to sympathy by
			the speaker's simple accent. </p>
		<p>—I was away all that day from my own place over in Buttevant
			- I don't know if you know where that is - at a hurling
			match between the Croke's Own Boys and the Fearless
			Thurles and by God, Stevie, that was the hard fight. My first
			cousin, Fonsy Davin, was stripped to his buff that day minding
			cool for the Limericks but he was up with the forwards half
			the time and shouting like mad. I never will forget that day.
			One of the Crokes made a woeful wipe at him one time with
			his camaun and I declare to God he was within an aim's ace of
			getting it at the side of the temple. Oh, honest to God, if the
			crook of it caught him that time he was done for. </p>
		<p>—I am glad he escaped, Stephen had  said with a laugh, but
			surely that's not the strange thing  that happened you? </p>
		<p>—Well, I suppose that doesn't interest you but leastways
			there was such noise after the match that I missed the train
			home and I couldn't get any kind of a yoke to give me a lift for,
			as luck would have it, there was a mass meeting that same day
			over in Castletownroche and all the cars in the country were
			there. So there was nothing for it only to stay the night or to
			foot it out. Well, I started to walk and on I went and it was
			coming on night when I got into the Ballyhoura hills; that's
			better than ten miles from Kilmallock and there's a long lonely
			road after that.  You wouldn't see the sign of a christian house
			along the road or hear a sound. It was pitch dark almost. Once
			or twice I stopped by the way under a bush to redden my pipe
			and only for the dew was thick I'd have stretched out there
			and slept. At last, after a bend of the road, I spied a little
			cottage with a light in the window. I went up and knocked at
			the door. A voice asked who was there and I answered I was
			over at the match in Buttevant and was walking back and that
			I'd be thankful for a glass of water. After a while a young
			woman opened the door and brought me out a big mug of
			milk. She was half undressed as if she was going to bed when I
			knocked and she had her hair hanging; and I thought by her
			figure and by something in the look of her eyes that she must
			be carrying a child. She kept me in talk a long while at the
			door and I thought it strange because her breast and her
			shoulders were bare. She asked me was I tired and would I
			like to stop the night there. She said she was all alone in the
			house and that her husband had gone that morning to Queenstown
			with his sister to see her off. And all the time she was
			talking, Stevie,  she had her eyes fixed on my face and she
			stood so close to me I could hear her breathing. When I
			handed her back the mug at last she took my hand to draw me
			in over the threshold and said: <emph>Come in and stay the night
			here. You've no call to be frightened. There's no one in it but
			ourselves</emph> .... I didn't go in, Stevie.  I thanked her and went
			on my way again, all in a fever. At the first bend of the road I
			looked back and she was standing at the door. </p>
		<p>The last words of Davin's story sang in his memory  and the
			figure of the woman in the story stood forth, reflected in other
			figures of the peasant women whom he had seen standing in
			the doorways at Clane as the college cars drove by, as a type
			of her race and his own, a batlike soul waking to the consciousness
			of itself in darkness and secrecy and loneliness and,
			through the eyes and voice and gesture of a woman without
			guile, calling the stranger to her bed. </p>
		<p>A hand was laid on his arm and a young voice cried: </p>
		<p>—Ah, gentleman, your own girl, sir! The first handsel
			today, gentleman. Buy  that lovely bunch. Will you, gentleman? </p>
		<p>The blue flowers which she lifted towards him and her
			young blue eyes seemed to him at that instant images of guilelessness;
			and he halted till the image had vanished and he saw
			only her ragged dress and damp coarse hair and  hoydenish
			face. </p>
		<p>—Do, gentleman! Don't forget your own girl, sir! </p>
		<p>—I have no money, said Stephen. </p>
		<p>—Buy them lovely ones, will you, sir? Only a penny. </p>
		<p>—Did you hear what I said? asked Stephen, bending towards
			her. I told you I had no money. I tell you again now. </p>
		<p>—Well, sure, you will some day, sir, please God, the girl
			answered after an instant. </p>
		<p>—Possibly, said Stephen, but I don't think it likely. </p>
		<p>He left her quickly, fearing that her intimacy might turn to
			gibing and wishing to be out of the way before she offered her
			ware to another, a tourist from England or a student of Trinity.
			Grafton Street, along which he walked, prolonged that
			moment of discouraged poverty. In the roadway at the head of
			the street a slab was set to the memory of Wolfe Tone and he
			remembered having been present with his father at its laying.
			He remembered with bitterness that scene of tawdry tribute.
			There were four French delegates in a brake and one, a plump
			smiling young man, held, wedged on a stick,  a card on which
			were printed the words: <seg xml:lang="fr">Vive l'Irlande!</seg></p>
		<p>But the trees in Stephen's Green were fragrant of rain and
			the rainsodden earth gave forth its mortal odour, a faint
			incense rising upward through the mould from many hearts.
			The soul of the gallant venal city which his elders had told him
			of had shrunk with time to a faint mortal odour rising from the
			earth and he knew that in a moment when he entered the
			sombre college he would be conscious of a corruption other
			than that of Buck Egan and Burnchapel Whaley. </p>
		<p>It was too late to go upstairs to the French class. He
			crossed the hall and took the corridor to the left which led to
			the physics theatre. The corridor was dark and silent but not
			unwatchful. Why did he feel that it was not unwatchful? Was
			it because he had heard that in Buck Whaley's time there was
			a secret staircase there? Or was the jesuit house extraterritorial
			and was he walking among aliens? The Ireland of Tone
			and of Parnell seemed to have receded in space. </p>
		<p>He opened the door of the theatre and halted in the chilly
			grey light that struggled through the dusty windows. A figure
			was crouching before the large grate and by its leanness and
			greyness he knew that it was the dean of studies lighting the
			fire. Stephen closed the door quietly and approached the
			fireplace. </p>
		<p>—Good morning, sir! Can I help you? </p>
		<p>The priest looked up quickly and said: </p>
		<p>—One moment now, Mr Dedalus, and you will see. There
			is an art in lighting a fire. We have the liberal arts and we have
			the useful arts. This is one of the useful arts. </p>
		<p>—I will try to learn it, said Stephen. </p>
		<p>—Not too much coal, said the dean, working briskly at his
			task, that is one of the secrets. </p>
		<p>He produced four candlebutts from the sidepockets of his
			soutane and placed them deftly among the coals and twisted
			papers. Stephen watched him in silence. Kneeling thus on the
			flagstone to kindle the fire and busied with the disposition of
			his wisps of paper and candlebutts he seemed more than ever
			a humble server making ready the place of sacrifice in an
			empty temple, a levite of the Lord. Like a levite's robe of
			plain linen the faded worn soutane draped the kneeling figure
			of one whom the canonicals or the  bellbordered ephod would
			irk and trouble. His very body had waxed old in lowly service
			of the Lord - in tending the fire upon the altar, in bearing
			tidings secretly, in waiting upon worldlings, in striking swiftly
			when bidden - and yet had remained ungraced by aught of
			saintly or of prelatic beauty. Nay, his very soul had waxed old
			in that service without growing towards light and beauty or
			spreading abroad a sweet odour of her sanctity - a mortified
			will no more responsive to the thrill of its obedience than was
			to the thrill of love or combat his aging body, spare and sinewy,
			greyed with a silverpointed down. </p>
		<p>The dean rested back on his hunkers and watched the sticks
			catch. Stephen, to fill the silence, said: </p>
		<p>—I am sure I could not light a fire. </p>
		<p>—You are an artist, are you not, Mr Dedalus? said the
			dean, glancing up and blinking his pale eyes. The object of the
			artist is the creation of the beautiful. What the beautiful is is
			another question. </p>
		<p>He rubbed his hands slowly and drily over the difficulty. </p>
		<p>—Can you solve that question now? he asked. </p>
		<p>—Aquinas, answered Stephen, says <seg xml:lang="la">Pulcra
			sunt quae visa placent</seg>.</p>
		<p>—This fire before us, said the dean, will be pleasing to the
			eye. Will it therefore be beautiful? </p>
		<p>—In so far as it is apprehended by the sight, which I suppose
			means here esthetic intellection, it will be beautiful. But
			Aquinas also says <seg xml:lang="la">Bonum est in quod tendit appetitus</seg>. In so
			far as it satisfies the animal craving for warmth fire is a good.
			In hell however it is an evil. </p>
		<p>—Quite so, said the dean, you have certainly hit the nail on
			the head. </p>
		<p>He rose nimbly and went towards the door, set it ajar and
			said: </p>
		<p>—A draught is said to be a help in these matters. </p>
		<p>As he came back to the hearth, limping slightly but with a
			brisk step, Stephen saw the silent soul of a jesuit look out at
			him from the pale loveless eyes. Like Ignatius he was lame but
			in his eyes burned no spark of Ignatius' enthusiasm. Even the
			legendary craft of the company, a craft subtler and more
			secret than its fabled books of secret subtle wisdom, had not
			fired his soul with the energy of apostleship. It seemed as if
			he used the shifts and lore and cunning of the world, as bidden
			to do, for the greater glory of God, without joy in their
			handling or hatred of that in them which was evil but turning
			them, with a firm gesture of obedience, back upon themselves:
			and for all this silent service it seemed as if he loved not at all
			the master and little, if at all, the ends he served. <seg xml:lang="la">Similiter
			atque senis baculus</seg>, he was, as the founder would have had
			him, like a staff in an old man's hand, to be left in a corner, to
			be leaned on in the road at nightfall or in stress of weather,  to
			lie with a lady's nosegay on a garden seat, to be raised in
			menace. </p>
		<p>The dean returned to the hearth and began to stroke his
			chin. </p>
		<p>—When may we expect to have something from you on the
			esthetic question? he asked. </p>
		<p>—From me! said Stephen in astonishment. I stumble on  an
			idea once a fortnight if I am lucky. </p>
		<p>—These questions are very profound, Mr Dedalus, said the
			dean. It is like looking down from the cliffs of Moher into the
			depths. Many go down into the depths and never come up.
			Only the trained diver can go down into those depths and
			explore them and come to the surface again. </p>
		<p>—If you mean speculation, sir, said Stephen, I also am sure
			that there is no such thing  as free thinking inasmuch as all
			thinking must be bound by its own laws. </p>
		<p>—Ha! </p>
		<p>—For my purpose I can work on at present by the light of
			one or two ideas of Aristotle and Aquinas. </p>
		<p>—I see. I quite see your point. </p>
		<p>—I need them only for my own use and guidance until I
			have done something for myself by their light. If the lamp
			smokes or smells I shall try to trim it. If it does not give light
			enough I shall sell it and buy another. </p>
		<p>—Epictetus also had a lamp, said the dean, which was sold
			for a fancy price after his death. It was the lamp he wrote his
			philosophical dissertations by. You know Epictetus? </p>
		<p>—An old gentleman, said Stephen coarsely, who said that
			the soul is very like a bucketful of water. </p>
		<p>—He tells us in his homely way, the dean went on, that
			he put an iron lamp before a statue of one of the gods and that
			a thief stole the lamp. What did the philosopher do? He reflected
			that it was in the character of a thief to steal and
			determined to buy an earthen lamp next day instead of the
			iron lamp. </p>
		<p>A smell  of molten  tallow came up from the dean's candle-butts
			and fused itself in Stephen's consciousness with the
			jingle of the words, bucket and lamp and lamp and bucket. The
			priest's voice too had a hard jingling tone. Stephen's mind
			halted by instinct, checked by the strange tone and the  imagery
			and by the priest's face which seemed like an unlit lamp
			or a reflector  hung in a false focus. What lay behind it or
			within it? A dull torpor of the soul or the dullness of the
			thundercloud, charged with intellection and capable of the
			gloom of God? </p>
		<p>—I meant a different kind of lamp, sir, said Stephen. </p>
		<p>—Undoubtedly, said the dean. </p>
		<p>—One difficulty, said Stephen, in esthetic discussion is to
			know whether words are being used according to the literary
			tradition or according to the tradition of the marketplace. I
			remember a sentence of Newman's in which he says of the
			Blessed Virgin that she was detained in the full company of the
			saints. The use of the word in the marketplace is quite
			different. <emph>I hope I am not detaining you.</emph> </p>
		<p>—Not in the least, said the dean politely. </p>
		<p>—No, no, said Stephen, smiling, I mean ... </p>
		<p>—Yes, yes: I see, said the dean quickly, I quite catch the
			point: <emph>detain</emph>. </p>
		<p>He thrust forward his under jaw and uttered a dry short
			cough. </p>
		<p>—To return to the lamp, he said, the feeding of it is also a
			nice problem. You must choose the pure oil and you must be
			careful when you pour it in not to overflow it, not to pour in
			more than the funnel can hold. </p>
		<p>—What funnel? asked Stephen. </p>
		<p>—The funnel through which you pour the  oil into your
			lamp. </p>
		<p>—That? said Stephen. Is that called a funnel? Is it not a
			tundish? </p>
		<p>—What is a tundish? </p>
		<p>—That. The ... the funnel. </p>
		<p>—Is that called a tundish in Ireland? asked the dean. I
			never heard the word in my life. </p>
		<p>—It is called a tundish in Lower Drumcondra, said Stephen
			laughing, where they speak the best English. </p>
		<p>—A tundish, said the dean reflectively. That is a most
			interesting word. I must look that word up. Upon my word I
			must. </p>
		<p>His courtesy of manner rang a little false, and Stephen
			looked at the English convert with the same eyes as the elder
			brother in the parable may have turned on the prodigal. A
			humble follower in the wake of clamorous conversions,  a
			poor Englishman in Ireland, he seemed to have entered on the
			stage of jesuit history when that strange play of intrigue and
			suffering and envy and struggle and indignity had been all but
			given through - a late comer, a tardy spirit.  From what had he
			set out? Perhaps he had been born and bred among serious
			dissenters, seeing salvation in Jesus only and abhorring the
			vain pomps of the establishment. Had he felt the need of an
			implicit faith amid the welter of sectarianism and the jargon of
			its turbulent schisms, six principle men, peculiar people, seed
			and snake baptists, supralapsarian dogmatists? Had he found
			the true church all of a sudden in winding up to the end like
			a reel of cotton some finespun line of reasoning upon insufflation
			or the imposition of hands or the procession of the
			Holy Ghost? Or had Lord Christ touched him and bidden him
			follow, like that disciple who had sat at the receipt of custom,
			as he sat by the door of some zincroofed chapel, yawning and
			telling over his church pence? </p>
		<p>The dean repeated the word yet again. </p>
		<p>—Tundish! Well now, that is interesting! </p>
		<p>—The question you asked me a moment ago seems to me
			more interesting. What is that beauty which the artist struggles
			to express from lumps of earth, said Stephen coldly. </p>
		<p>The little word seemed to have turned a rapier point of his
			sensitiveness against this courteous and vigilant foe. He felt
			with a smart of dejection that the man to whom he was speaking
			was a countryman of Ben Jonson. He thought: </p>
		<p>—The language in which we are speaking is his before it is
			mine. How different are the words <emph>home, Christ, ale, master</emph>,
			on his lips and on mine! I cannot speak or write these words
			without unrest of spirit. His language, so familiar and so
			foreign, will always be for me an acquired speech. I have not
			made or accepted its words. My voice holds them at bay. My
			soul frets in the shadow of his language. </p>
		<p>—And to distinguish between the beautiful and the sublime,
			the dean added. To distinguish between moral beauty and
			material beauty. And to inquire what kind of  beauty is proper
			to each of the various arts. These are some interesting points
			we might take up. </p>
		<p>Stephen, disheartened suddenly by the dean's firm dry tone,
			was silent. The dean also was silent: and through the silence a
			distant noise of many boots and confused voices came up the
			staircase. </p>
		<p>—In pursuing  these speculations, said the dean conclusively,
			there is however the danger of perishing of inanition.
			First you must take your degree. Set that before you as your
			first aim. Then little by little, you will see your way. I mean in
			every sense, your way in life and in thinking. It may be uphill
			pedalling at first. Take Mr Moonan. He was a long time before
			he got to the top. But he got there. </p>
		<p>—I may not have his talent, said Stephen quietly. </p>
		<p>—You never know, said the dean brightly. We never can
			say what is in us. I most certainly should not be despondent.
			<seg xml:lang="la">Per aspera ad astra.</seg> </p>
		<p>He left the hearth quickly and went towards the landing to
			oversee the arrival of the first arts' class. </p>
		<p>Leaning against the fireplace Stephen heard him greet
			briskly and impartially every student of the class and could
			almost see the frank smiles of the coarser students. A desolating
			pity began to fall like a dew upon his easily embittered
			heart for this faithful servingman of the knightly Loyola, for
			this halfbrother of the clergy, more venal than they in speech,
			more steadfast of soul than they, one whom he would never
			call his ghostly father: and he thought how this man and his
			companions had earned the name of worldlings at the hands
			not of the unworldly only but of the worldly also for having
			pleaded, during all their history, at the bar of God's justice for
			the souls of the lax and the lukewarm and the prudent. </p>
		<p>The entry of the professor was signalled by a few rounds of
			Kentish fire from the heavy boots of those students who sat on
			the highest tier of the gloomy theatre under the grey cobwebbed
			windows. The calling of the roll began and the responses
			to the names were given out in all tones until the name
			of Peter Byrne was reached. </p>
		<p>—Here! </p>
		<p>A deep base note in response came from the upper tier,
			followed by coughs of protest along the other benches. </p>
		<p>The professor paused in his reading and called the next
			name: </p>
		<p>—Cranly! </p>
		<p>No answer. </p>
		<p>—Mr Cranly! </p>
		<p>A smile flew across Stephen's face as he thought of his
			friend's studies. </p>
		<p>—Try Leopardstown! said a voice from the bench behind. </p>
		<p>Stephen glanced up quickly but Moynihan's snoutish face,
			outlined on the grey light, was impassive. A formula was given
			out. Amid the rustling of the notebooks Stephen turned back
			again and said: </p>
		<p>—Give me some paper for God's sake. </p>
		<p>—Are you as bad as that? asked Moynihan with a broad
			grin. </p>
		<p>He tore a sheet from his scribbler and passed it down,
			whispering: </p>
		<p>—In case of necessity any layman or woman can do it. </p>
		<p>The formula which he wrote obediently on the sheet of
			paper, the coiling and uncoiling calculations of the professor,
			the spectrelike symbols of force and velocity fascinated and
			jaded Stephen's mind. He had heard some say that the old
			professor was an atheist freemason. O the grey dull day! It
			seemed a limbo of painless patient consciousness through
			which souls of mathematicians might wander, projecting long
			slender fabrics from plane to plane of ever rarer and paler
			twilight, radiating swift eddies to the last verges of a universe
			ever vaster, farther and more impalpable. </p>
		<p>—So we must distinguish between elliptical and ellipsoidal.
			Perhaps some of you gentlemen may be familiar with the
			works of Mr W. S. Gilbert. In one of his songs he speaks of
			the billiard sharp who is condemned to play: </p>
		<lg type="song">
			<l>On a cloth untrue </l>
			<l>With a twisted cue </l>
			<l>And elliptical billiard balls. </l>
		</lg>
		<p>—He means a ball having the form of the ellipsoid of the
			principal axes of which I spoke a moment ago. </p>
		<p>Moynihan leaned down towards Stephen's ear and murmured: </p>
		<p>—What price ellipsoidal balls! Chase me, ladies, I'm in the
			cavalry! </p>
		<p>His fellowstudent's rude humour ran like a gust through the
			cloister of Stephen's mind, shaking into gay life limp priestly
			vestments that hung upon the walls, setting them to sway and
			caper in a sabbath of misrule. The forms of the community
			emerged from the gustblown vestments, the dean of studies,
			the portly florid bursar with his cap of grey hair, the president,
			the little priest with feathery hair who wrote devout verses, the
			squat peasant form of the professor of economics, the tall
			form of the young professor of mental science discussing on
			the landing a case of conscience with his class like a giraffe
			cropping high leafage among a herd of antelopes, the grave
			troubled prefect of the sodality, the plump roundheaded
			professor of Italian with his rogue's eyes. They came ambling
			and stumbling, tumbling and capering, kilting their gowns for
			leap frog, holding one another back, shaken with deep fast
			laughter, smacking one another behind and laughing at their
			rude malice, calling to one another by familiar nicknames,
			protesting  with sudden dignity at some rough usage, whispering
			two and two behind their hands. </p>
		<p>The professor had gone to the glass cases on the sidewall
			from a shelf of which he took down a set of coils, blew away
			the dust from many points and, bearing it carefully to the
			table, held a finger on it while he proceeded with his lecture.
			He explained that the wires in modern coils were of a compound
			called platinoid lately discovered by F. W. Martino. </p>
		<p>He spoke clearly the initials and surname of the discoverer.
			Moynihan whispered from behind: </p>
		<p>—Good old Fresh Water Martin! </p>
		<p>—Ask him, Stephen whispered back with weary humour, if
			he wants a subject for electrocution. He can have me. </p>
		<p>Moynihan, seeing the professor bend over the coils, rose in
			his bench and, clacking noiselessly the fingers of his right
			hand, began to call with the voice of a slobbering urchin: </p>
		<p>—Please, teacher! Please, teacher! This boy is after saying a
			bad word, teacher. </p>
		<p>—Platinoid, the professor said solemnly, is preferred to
			German silver because it has a lower coefficient of resistance
			variation by changes of temperature. The platinoid wire is
			insulated and the covering of silk that insulates it is wound on
			the ebonite bobbins just where my finger is. If it were wound
			single an extra current would be induced in the coils. The
			bobbins are saturated in hot paraffin wax ... </p>
		<p>A sharp Ulster voice said from the bench below Stephen: </p>
		<p>—Are we  likely to be asked questions on applied science? </p>
		<p>The professor began to juggle gravely with the terms pure
			science and applied science. A heavybuilt student wearing
			gold spectacles stared with some wonder at the questioner.
			Moynihan murmured from behind in his natural voice: </p>
		<p>—Isn't MacAlister a devil for his pound of flesh? </p>
		<p>Stephen looked down coldly on the oblong skull beneath
			him overgrown with tangled twinecoloured hair. The voice,
			the accent, the mind of the questioner offended him and he
			allowed the offence to carry  him towards wilful unkindness,
			bidding his mind think that the student's father would have
			done better had he sent his son to Belfast to study and have
			saved something on the train fare by so doing. </p>
		<p>The oblong skull beneath did not turn to meet this shaft of
			thought and yet the shaft came back to its bowstring: for he
			saw in a moment the student's wheypale face. </p>
		<p>—That thought is not mine, he said to himself quickly. It
			came from the comic Irishman in the bench behind. Patience.
			Can you say with certitude by whom the soul of your race was
			bartered and its elect betrayed - by the questioner or  by the
			mocker? Patience. Remember Epictetus. It is probably in his
			character to ask such a question at such a moment in such a
			tone and to pronounce the word <emph>science</emph> as a monosyllable. </p>
		<p>The droning voice of the professor continued to wind itself
			slowly round and round the coils it spoke of, doubling, trebling,
			quadrupling its somnolent energy as the coil multiplied
			its ohms of resistance. </p>
		<p>Moynihan's voice called from behind in echo to a distant
			bell: </p>
		<p>—Closing time, gents! </p>
		<p>The entrance hall was crowded and loud with talk. On a
			table near the door were two photographs in frames and
			between them a long roll of paper bearing an irregular tail of
			signatures. MacCann went briskly to and fro among the students,
			talking rapidly, answering rebuffs and leading one after
			another to the table. In the inner hall the dean of studies stood
			talking to a young professor, stroking his chin gravely and
			nodding his head. </p>
		<p>Stephen,  checked by the crowd at the door, halted irresolutely.
			From under the wide falling leaf of a soft hat Cranly's
			dark eyes were watching him. </p>
		<p>—Have you signed? Stephen asked. </p>
		<p>Cranly closed his long thinlipped mouth, communed with
			himself an instant and answered: </p>
		<p>—<seg xml:lang="la">Ego habeo.</seg> </p>
		<p>—What is it for? </p>
		<p>—<seg xml:lang="la">Quod?</seg> </p>
		<p>—What is it for? </p>
		<p>Cranly turned his pale face to Stephen and said blandly and
			bitterly: </p>
		<p>—<seg xml:lang="la">Per pax universalis.</seg> </p>
		<p>Stephen pointed to the Csar's photograph and said: </p>
		<p>—He has the face of a besotted Christ. </p>
		<p>The scorn and anger in his voice brought Cranly's eyes back
			from a calm survey of the walls of the hall. </p>
		<p>—Are you annoyed? he asked. </p>
		<p>—No, answered Stephen. </p>
		<p>—Are you in bad humour? </p>
		<p>—No. </p>
		<p>—<seg xml:lang="la">Credo ut vos sanguinarius mendax estis</seg>, said Cranly, <seg xml:lang="la">quia
					facies vostra monstrat ut vos in damno malo humore estis.</seg></p>
		<p>Moynihan, on his way to the table, said in Stephen's ear: </p>
		<p>—MacCann is in tiptop form. Ready to shed the last drop.
			Brandnew world. No stimulants and votes for the bitches. </p>
		<p>Stephen smiled at the manner of this confidence and, when
			Moynihan had passed, turned again to meet Cranly's eyes. </p>
		<p>—Perhaps you can tell me, he said, why he pours his soul
			so freely into my ear. Can you? </p>
		<p>A dull scowl appeared on Cranly's forehead. He stared at
			the table where Moynihan had bent to write his name on the
			roll, and then said flatly: </p>
		<p>—A sugar! </p>
		<p>—<seg xml:lang="la">Quis est in malo humore</seg>, said Stephen, <seg xml:lang="la">ego aut vos?</seg></p>
		<p>Cranly did not take up the taunt. He brooded sourly on his
			judgment and repeated with the same flat force: </p>
		<p>—A flaming bloody sugar, that's what he is! </p>
		<p>It was his epitaph for all dead friendships and Stephen
			wondered whether it would ever be spoken in the same tone
			over his memory. The heavy lumpish phrase sank slowly out
			of hearing like a stone through a quagmire. Stephen saw it
			sink as he had seen many another, feeling its heaviness depress
			his heart. Cranly's speech, unlike that of Davin, had
			neither rare phrases of Elizabethan English nor quaintly turned
			versions of Irish idioms. Its drawl was an echo of the quays of
			Dublin given back by a bleak decaying seaport, its energy an
			echo of the sacred eloquence of Dublin given back flatly by a
			Wicklow pulpit. </p>
		<p>The heavy scowl faded from Cranly's face as MacCann
			marched briskly towards them from the other side of the hall. </p>
		<p>—Here you are! said MacCann cheerily. </p>
		<p>—Here I am! said Stephen. </p>
		<p>—Late as usual. Can you not combine the progressive
			tendency with a respect for punctuality? </p>
		<p>—That question is out of order, said Stephen. Next business. </p>
		<p>His smiling eyes were fixed on a silverwrapped tablet of
			milk chocolate which peeped out of the propagandist's breastpocket.
			A little ring of listeners closed round to hear the war
			of wits. A lean student with olive skin and lank black hair
			thrust his face between the two, glancing from one to the other
			at each phrase and seeming to try to catch each flying phrase
			in his open moist mouth. Cranly took a small grey handball
			from his pocket and began to examine it closely, turning it
			over and over. </p>
		<p>—Next business? said MacCann. Hom! </p>
		<p>He gave a loud cough of laughter, smiled broadly and
			tugged twice at  the strawcoloured goatee which hung from his
			blunt chin. </p>
		<p>—The next business is to sign the testimonial. </p>
		<p>—Will you pay me anything if I sign? asked Stephen. </p>
		<p>—I thought you were an idealist, said MacCann. </p>
		<p>The gipsylike student looked about him and addressed the
			onlookers in an indistinct bleating voice. </p>
		<p>—By hell, that's a queer notion. I consider that notion to be
			a mercenary notion. </p>
		<p>His voice faded into silence. No heed was paid to his words.
			He turned his olive face, equine in expression, towards Stephen,
			inviting him to speak again. </p>
		<p>MacCann began to speak with fluent energy of the Csar's
			rescript, of Stead, of general disarmament, arbitration in cases
			of international disputes, of the signs of the times, of the new
			humanity and the new gospel of life which would make it the
			business of the community to secure as cheaply as possible
			the greatest possible happiness of the greatest possible number. </p>
		<p>The gipsy student responded to the close of the period by
			crying: </p>
		<p>—Three cheers for universal brotherhood! </p>
		<p>—Go on, Temple, said a stout ruddy student near him. I'll
			stand you a pint after. </p>
		<p>—I'm a believer in universal brotherhood, said Temple,
			glancing about him out of his dark, oval eyes. Marx is only a
			bloody cod. </p>
		<p>Cranly gripped his arm tightly to check his tongue, smiling
			uneasily, and repeated: </p>
		<p>—Easy, easy, easy! </p>
		<p>Temple struggled to free his arm but continued, his mouth
			flecked by a thin foam: </p>
		<p>—Socialism was founded by an Irishman and the first man
			in Europe who preached the freedom of thought was Collins.
			Two hundred years ago. He denounced priestcraft, the philosopher
			of Middlesex. Three cheers for John Anthony Collins! </p>
		<p>A thin voice from the verge of the ring replied: </p>
		<p>—Pip! pip! </p>
		<p>Moynihan murmured beside Stephen's ear: </p>
		<p>—And what about John Anthony's poor little sister: </p>
		<lg>
			<l>Lottie Collins lost her drawers; </l>
			<l>Won't you kindly lend her yours? </l>
		</lg>
		<p>Stephen laughed and Moynihan, pleased with the result,
			murmured again: </p>
		<p>—We'll have five bob each way on John Anthony Collins. </p>
		<p>—I am waiting for your answer, said MacCann briefly. </p>
		<p>—The affair doesn't interest me in the least, said Stephen
			wearily. You know that well. Why do you make a scene about
			it? </p>
		<p>—Good!  said MacCann, smacking his lips. You are a
			reactionary then? </p>
		<p>—Do you think you impress me, Stephen asked, when you
			flourish your wooden sword? </p>
		<p>—Metaphors! said MacCann bluntly. Come to facts. </p>
		<p>Stephen blushed and turned aside. MacCann stood his
			ground and said with hostile humour: </p>
		<p>—Minor poets, I suppose, are above such trivial questions
			as the question of universal peace. </p>
		<p>Cranly raised his head and held the handball between the
			two students by way of a peaceoffering, saying: </p>
		<p>—<seg xml:lang="la">Pax super totum sanguinarium globum.</seg> </p>
		<p>Stephen, moving away the bystanders, jerked his shoulder
			angrily in the direction of the Csar's image, saying: </p>
		<p>—Keep your icon. If we must have a Jesus, let us have a
			legitimate Jesus. </p>
		<p>—By hell, that's a good one! said the gipsy student to those
			about him. That's a fine expression. I like that expression
			immensely. </p>
		<p>He gulped down the spittle in his throat as if he were gulping
			down the phrase and, fumbling at the peak of his tweed
			cap, turned to Stephen, saying: </p>
		<p>—Excuse me, sir, what do you mean by that expression you
			uttered just now? </p>
		<p>Feeling himself jostled by the students near him, he said to
			them: </p>
		<p>—I am curious to know now what he meant by that expression. </p>
		<p>He turned again to Stephen and said in a whisper: </p>
		<p>—Do you believe in Jesus? I believe in man. Of course, I
			don't know if you believe in man. I admire you, sir. I admire
			the mind of man independent of all religions. Is that your
			opinion about the mind of Jesus? </p>
		<p>—Go on, Temple, said the stout ruddy student, returning,
			as was his wont, to his first idea, that pint is waiting for you. </p>
		<p>—He thinks I'm an imbecile, Temple explained to Stephen,
			because I'm a  believer in the power of mind. </p>
		<p>Cranly linked his arms into those of Stephen and his admirer
			and said: </p>
		<p>—<seg xml:lang="la">Nos ad manum ballum jocabimus.</seg></p>
		<p>Stephen, in the act of being led away, caught sight of MacCann's
			flushed bluntfeatured face. </p>
		<p>—My signature is of no account, he said politely. You are
			right to go your way. Leave me to go mine. </p>
		<p>—Dedalus, said MacCann crisply, I believe you're a good
			fellow but you have yet to learn the dignity of altruism and the
			responsibility of the human individual. </p>
		<p>A voice said: </p>
		<p>—Intellectual crankery is better out of this movement than
			in it. </p>
		<p>Stephen, recognising  the harsh tone of MacAlister's voice,
			did not turn in the direction of the voice. Cranly pushed solemnly
			through the throng of students, linking Stephen and
			Temple like a celebrant attended by his ministers on his way
			to the altar. </p>
		<p>Temple bent eagerly across Cranly's breast and said: </p>
		<p>—Did you hear MacAlister what he said? That youth is
			jealous of you. Did you see that? I bet Cranly didn't see that.
			By hell, I saw that at once. </p>
		<p>As they crossed the inner hall the dean of studies was in  the
			act of escaping from the student with whom he had been
			conversing. He stood at the foot of the staircase, a foot on the
			lowest step, his threadbare  soutane gathered about him for the
			ascent with womanish care, nodding his head often and repeating: </p>
		<p>—Not a doubt of it, Mr Hackett! Very fine! Not a doubt of
			it! </p>
		<p>In the middle of the hall the prefect of the college sodality
			was speaking earnestly, in a soft querulous voice, with a
			boarder. As he spoke he wrinkled a little his freckled brow
			and bit, between his phrases, at a tiny bone pencil. </p>
		<p>—I hope the matric men will all come. The first arts men
			are pretty sure. Second arts too. We must make sure of the
			newcomers. </p>
		<p>Temple bent again across Cranly, as they were passing
			through the doorway, and said in a swift whisper: </p>
		<p>—Do you know that he is a married man? He was a married
			man before they converted him. He has a wife and children
			somewhere. By hell, I think that's the queerest notion I
			ever heard! Eh? </p>
		<p>His whisper trailed off into sly cackling laughter. The moment
			they were through the doorway Cranly seized him rudely
			by the neck and shook him, saying: </p>
		<p>—You flaming floundering fool! I'll take my dying bible
			there isn't a bigger bloody ape, do you know, than you in the
			whole flaming bloody world! </p>
		<p>Temple wriggled in his grip, laughing still with sly content,
			while Cranly repeated flatly at every rude shake: </p>
		<p>—A flaming flaring  bloody idiot! </p>
		<p>They crossed the weedy garden together. The president,
			wrapped in a heavy loose cloak, was coming towards them
			along one of the walks, reading his office. At the end of the
			walk he halted before turning and raised his eyes. The students
			saluted, Temple fumbling as before at the peak of his
			cap. They walked forward in silence. As they neared the alley
			Stephen could hear the thuds of the players' hands and the wet
			smacks of the ball and Davin's voice crying out excitedly at
			each stroke. </p>
		<p>The three students halted round the box on which Davin sat
			to follow the game. Temple, after a few moments, sidled
			across to Stephen and said: </p>
		<p>—Excuse me, I wanted to ask you do you believe that Jean
			Jacques Rousseau was a sincere man? </p>
		<p>Stephen laughed outright. Cranly, picking up the broken
			stave of a cask from the grass at his foot, turned swiftly and
			said sternly: </p>
		<p>—Temple, I declare to the living God if you say another
			word, do you know, to anybody on any subject I'll kill you
			<seg xml:lang="la">super spottum</seg>. </p>
		<p>—He was like you, I fancy, said Stephen, an emotional
			man. </p>
		<p>—Blast him, curse him! said Cranly broadly. Don't talk to
			him at all. Sure, you might as well be talking, do you know, to
			a flaming chamberpot as talking to Temple. Go home, Temple.
			For God's sake, go home. </p>
		<p>—I don't care a damn about you, Cranly, answered Temple,
			moving out of reach of the uplifted stave and pointing at
			Stephen. He's the only man I see in this institution that has an
			individual mind. </p>
		<p>—Institution! Individual! cried Cranly. Go home, blast you,
			for you're a hopeless bloody man. </p>
		<p>—I'm an emotional man, said Temple. That's quite rightly
			expressed. And I'm proud that I'm an emotionalist. </p>
		<p>He sidled out of the alley, smiling slily. Cranly watched him
			with a blank expressionless face. </p>
		<p>—Look at him! he said. Did you ever see such a go-by-the-wall? </p>
		<p>His phrase was greeted by a strange laugh from a student
			who lounged against the wall, his peaked cap down on his eyes.
			The laugh, pitched in a high key and coming from a so muscular
			frame, seemed like the whinny of an elephant. The student's
			body shook all over and, to ease his mirth, he rubbed
			both his hands delightedly, over  his groins. </p>
		<p>—Lynch is awake, said Cranly. </p>
		<p>Lynch, for answer, straightened himself and thrust forward
			his chest. </p>
		<p>—Lynch puts out his chest, said Stephen, as a criticism of
			life. </p>
		<p>Lynch smote himself sonorously on the chest and said: </p>
		<p>—Who has anything to say about my girth? </p>
		<p>Cranly took him at the word and the two began to tussle.
			When their faces had flushed with the struggle they drew
			apart, panting. Stephen bent down towards Davin who, intent
			on the game, had paid no heed to the talk of the others. </p>
		<p>—And how is my little tame goose? he asked. Did he sign
			too? </p>
		<p>Davin nodded and said: </p>
		<p>—And you, Stevie? </p>
		<p>Stephen shook his head. </p>
		<p>—You're a terrible man, Stevie, said Davin, taking the
			short pipe from his mouth. Always alone. </p>
		<p>—Now that you have signed the petition for universal
			peace, said Stephen, I suppose you will burn that little copybook
			I saw in your room. </p>
		<p>As Davin did not answer Stephen began to quote: </p>
		<p>—Long pace, fianna! Right incline, fianna! Fianna, by
			numbers, salute, one, two! </p>
		<p>—That's a different question, said Davin. I'm an Irish
			nationalist, first and foremost. But that's you all out. You're
			a born sneerer, Stevie. </p>
		<p>—When you make the next rebellion with hurleysticks, said
			Stephen, and want the indispensable informer, tell me. I can
			find you a few in this college. </p>
		<p>—I can't understand you, said Davin. One time I hear you
			talk against English literature. Now you talk against the  Irish
			informers. What with your name and your ideas ... Are
			you Irish at all? </p>
		<p>—Come with me now to the office of arms and I will show
			you the tree of my family, said Stephen. </p>
		<p>—Then be one of us, said Davin. Why don't you learn
			Irish? Why did you drop out of the league class after the first
			lesson? </p>
		<p>—You know one reason why, answered Stephen. </p>
		<p>Davin tossed his head and laughed. </p>
		<p>—O, come now, he said. Is it on account of that certain
			young lady and Father Moran? But that's all in your own
			mind, Stevie. They were only talking and laughing. </p>
		<p>Stephen paused and laid a friendly hand upon Davin's
			shoulder. </p>
		<p>—Do you remember, he said, when we knew each other
			first? The first morning we met you asked me to show you the
			way to the matriculation class, putting a very strong stress on
			the first syllable. You remember? Then you used to address
			the jesuits as father, you remember? I ask myself about you:
			<emph>Is he as innocent as his speech?</emph> </p>
		<p>—I'm a simple person, said Davin. You know that. When
			you told me that night in Harcourt Street those things about
			your private life, honest to God, Stevie, I was not able to eat
			my dinner. I was quite bad. I was awake a long time that
			night. Why did you tell me those things? </p>
		<p>—Thanks, said Stephen. You mean I am a monster. </p>
		<p>—No, said Davin, but I wish you had not told me. </p>
		<p>A tide began to surge beneath the calm surface of Stephen's
			friendliness. </p>
		<p>—This race and this country and this life produced me, he
			said. I shall express myself as I am. </p>
		<p>—Try to be one of us, repeated Davin. In your heart you
			are an Irishman but your pride is too powerful. </p>
		<p>—My ancestors threw off their language and took another,
			Stephen said. They allowed a handful of foreigners to subject
			them. Do you fancy I am going to pay in my own life and
			person debts they made? What for? </p>
		<p>—For our freedom, said Davin. </p>
		<p>—No honourable and sincere man, said Stephen, has given
			up to you his life and his youth and his affections from the
			days of Tone to those of Parnell but you sold him to the
			enemy or failed him in need or reviled him and left him for
			another. And you invite me to be one of you. I'd see you
			damned first. </p>
		<p>—They died for their ideals, Stevie, said Davin. Our day
			will come yet, believe me. </p>
		<p>Stephen, following his own thought, was silent for an instant. </p>
		<p>—The soul is born, he said vaguely, first in those moments
			I told you of. It has a slow and dark birth, more mysterious
			than  the birth of the body. When the soul of a man is born in
			this country there are nets flung at it to hold it back from
			flight. You talk to me of nationality, language, religion. I shall
			try to fly by those nets. </p>
		<p>Davin knocked the ashes from his pipe. </p>
		<p>—Too deep for me, Stevie, he said. But a man's country
			comes first. Ireland first, Stevie. You can be a poet or mystic
			after. </p>
		<p>—Do you know what Ireland is? asked Stephen with cold
			violence. Ireland is the old sow that eats her farrow. </p>
		<p>Davin rose from his box and went towards the players,
			shaking his head sadly. But in a moment his sadness left him
			and he was hotly disputing with Cranly and the two players
			who had finished their game. A match of four was arranged,
			Cranly insisting, however, that his ball should be used. He let
			it rebound twice or thrice to his hand and struck it strongly
			and swiftly towards the base of the alley, exclaiming in answer
			to its thud: </p>
		<p>—Your soul! </p>
		<p>Stephen stood with Lynch till the score began to rise. Then
			he plucked him by the sleeve to come away. Lynch obeyed,
			saying: </p>
		<p>—Let us eke go, as Cranly has it. </p>
		<p>Stephen smiled at this sidethrust. They passed back through
			the garden and out through the hall where the doddering
			porter was pinning up a notice in the frame. At the foot of the
			steps they halted and Stephen took a packet of cigarettes from
			his pocket and offered it to his companion. </p>
		<p>—I know you are poor, he said. </p>
		<p>—Damn your yellow insolence, answered Lynch. </p>
		<p>This second proof of Lynch's culture made Stephen smile
			again. </p>
		<p>—It was a great day for European culture, he said, when
			you made up your mind to swear in yellow. </p>
		<p>They lit their cigarettes and turned to the right. After a
			pause Stephen began: </p>
		<p>—Aristotle has not defined pity and terror. I have. I
			say ... </p>
		<p>Lynch halted and said bluntly: </p>
		<p>—Stop! I won't listen! I am sick. I was out last night on a
			yellow drunk with Horan and Goggins. </p>
		<p>Stephen went on: </p>
		<p>—Pity is the feeling which arrests the mind in the presence
			of whatsoever is grave and constant in human sufferings and
			unites it with the human sufferer.  Terror is the feeling which
			arrests the mind in the presence of whatsoever is grave and
			constant in human sufferings and unites it with the secret
			cause. </p>
		<p>—Repeat, said Lynch. </p>
		<p>Stephen repeated the definitions slowly. </p>
		<p>—A girl got into a hansom a few days ago, he went on, in
			London. She was on her way to meet her mother whom she
			had not seen for many years. At the corner of a street the shaft
			of a lorry shivered the window of the hansom in the shape of a
			star. A long fine needle of the shivered glass pierced her heart.
			She died on the instant. The reporter called it a tragic death. It
			is not. It is remote from terror and pity according to the terms
			of my definitions. </p>
		<p>—The tragic emotion, in fact, is a face looking two ways,
			towards terror and towards pity, both of which are phases of
			it. You see I use the word <emph>arrest</emph>. I mean that the tragic emotion
			is static. Or rather the dramatic emotion is. The feelings
			excited by improper art are kinetic, desire or loathing. Desire
			urges us to possess, to go to something; loathing  urges us to
			abandon, to go from something. These are kinetic emotions.
			The arts which excite them, pornographical or didactic, are
			therefore improper arts. The esthetic emotion (I use the
			general term) is therefore static. The mind is arrested and
			raised above desire and loathing. </p>
		<p>—You say that art must not excite desire, said Lynch. I
			told you that one day I wrote my name in pencil on the backside
			of the Venus of Praxiteles in the Museum. Was that not
			desire? </p>
		<p>—I speak of normal natures, said Stephen. You also told
			me that when you were a boy in that charming carmelite
			school you ate pieces of dried cowdung. </p>
		<p>Lynch broke again into a whinny of laughter and again
			rubbed both his hands over his groins but without taking them
			from his pockets. </p>
		<p>—O I did! I did! he cried. </p>
		<p>Stephen turned towards his companion and looked at him
			for a moment boldly in the eyes. Lynch, recovering from his
			laughter, answered his look from his humbled eyes. The long
			slender flattened skull beneath the long pointed cap brought
			before Stephen's mind the image of a hooded reptile. The
			eyes, too, were reptilelike in glint and gaze. Yet at that instant,
			humbled and alert in their look, they were lit by one tiny
			human point, the window of a shrivelled soul, poignant and
			selfembittered. </p>
		<p>—As for that, Stephen said in polite parenthesis, we are all
			animals. I also am an animal. </p>
		<p>—You are, said Lynch. </p>
		<p>—But we are just now in a mental world, Stephen continued.
			The desire and loathing excited by improper esthetic
			means are really unesthetic emotions not only because they
			are kinetic in character but also because they are not more
			than physical. Our flesh shrinks from what it dreads and
			responds to the stimulus of what it desires by a purely reflex
			action of the nervous system. Our eyelid closes before we are
			aware that the fly is about to enter our eye. </p>
		<p>—Not always, said Lynch critically. </p>
		<p>—In the same way, said Stephen, your flesh responded to
			the stimulus of a naked statue but it was, I say, simply a reflex
			action of the nerves. Beauty expressed by the artist cannot
			awaken in us an emotion which is kinetic or a sensation which
			is purely physical. It awakens, or ought to awaken, or induces,
			or ought to induce, an esthetic stasis, an ideal pity or an ideal
			terror, a stasis called forth, prolonged and at last dissolved by
			what I call the rhythm of beauty. </p>
		<p>—What is that exactly? asked Lynch. </p>
		<p>—Rhythm, said Stephen, is the first formal esthetic relation
			of part to part in any esthetic whole or of an esthetic whole to
			its part or parts or of any part to the esthetic whole of which it
			is a part. </p>
		<p>—If that is rhythm, said Lynch, let me hear what you call
			beauty: and, please remember, though I did eat a cake of
			cowdung once, that I admire only beauty. </p>
		<p>Stephen raised his cap as if in greeting. Then,  blushing
			slightly, he laid his hand on Lynch's thick tweed sleeve. </p>
		<p>—We are right, he said, and the others are wrong. To speak
			of these things and to try to understand their nature and,
			having understood it, to try slowly and humbly and constantly
			to express, to press out again, from the gross earth or what it
			brings forth, from sound and shape and colour which are the
			prison gates of our soul, an image of the beauty we have come
			to understand - that is art. </p>
		<p>They had reached the canal bridge and, turning from their
			course, went on by the trees. A crude grey light, mirrored in
			the sluggish water, and a smell of wet branches over their
			heads seemed to war against the course of Stephen's thought. </p>
		<p>—But you have not answered my question, said Lynch.
			What is art? What is the beauty it expresses? </p>
		<p>—That was the first definition I gave you, you sleepyheaded
			wretch, said Stephen, when I began to try to think out
			the matter for myself. Do you remember the night? Cranly
			lost his temper and began to talk about Wicklow bacon. </p>
		<p>—I remember, said Lynch. He told us about them flaming
			fat devils of pigs. </p>
		<p>—Art, said Stephen, is the human disposition of sensible or
			intelligible matter for an esthetic end. You remember the pigs
			and forget that. You are a distressing pair, you and Cranly. </p>
		<p>Lynch made a grimace at the raw grey sky and said: </p>
		<p>—If I am to listen to your esthetic philosophy give me at
			least another cigarette. I don't care about it. I don't even care
			about women. Damn you and damn everything. I want a job
			of five hundred a year. You can't get me one. </p>
		<p>Stephen handed him the packet of cigarettes. Lynch took the
			last one that remained, saying simply: </p>
		<p>—Proceed! </p>
		<p>—Aquinas, said Stephen, says that is beautiful the apprehension
			of which pleases. </p>
		<p>Lynch nodded. </p>
		<p>—I remember that, he said. <seg xml:lang="la">Pulcra sunt quae visa placent.</seg></p>
		<p>—He uses the word <seg xml:lang="la">visa</seg>, said Stephen, to cover esthetic
			apprehensions of all kinds, whether through sight or hearing
			or through any other avenue of apprehension. This word,
			though it is vague, is clear enough to keep away good and evil
			which excite desire and loathing. It means certainly a stasis
			and not a kinesis. How about the true? It produces also a
			stasis of the mind. You would not write your name in pencil
			across the hypothenuse of a rightangled triangle. </p>
		<p>—No, said Lynch, give me the hypothenuse of the Venus of
			Praxiteles. </p>
		<p>—Static therefore, said Stephen. Plato, I believe, said that
			beauty is the splendour of truth. I don't think that it has a
			meaning but the true and the beautiful are akin. Truth is
			beheld by the intellect which is appeased by the most satisfying
			relations of the intelligible:  beauty is beheld by the imagination
			which is appeased by the most satisfying relations of
			the sensible. The first step in the direction of truth is to
			understand the frame and scope of the intellect itself, to comprehend
			the act itself of intellection. Aristotle's entire system of
			philosophy rests upon his book of psychology and that, I
			think, rests on his statement that the same attribute cannot at
			the same time and in the same connection belong to and not
			belong to the same subject. The first step in the direction of
			beauty is to understand the frame and scope of the imagination,
			to comprehend the act itself of esthetic apprehension. Is
			that clear? </p>
		<p>—But what is beauty? asked Lynch impatiently. Out with
			another definition. Something we see and like! Is that the best
			you and Aquinas can do? </p>
		<p>—Let us take woman, said Stephen. </p>
		<p>—Let us take her! said Lynch fervently. </p>
		<p>—The Greek, the Turk, the Chinese, the Copt, the Hottentot,
			said Stephen, all admire a different type of female beauty.
			That seems to be a maze out of which we cannot escape. I see
			however two ways out. One is this hypothesis: that every
			physical quality admired by men in women is in direct connection
			with the manifold functions of women for the propagation
			of the species. It may be so. The world, it seems, is drearier
			than even you, Lynch, imagined. For my part I dislike that
			way out. It leads to eugenics rather than to esthetic. It leads
			you out of the maze into a new gaudy lectureroom where MacCann,
			with one hand on <emph>The Origin of Species</emph> and the other
			hand on the new testament, tells you that you admired the
			great flanks of Venus because you felt that she would bear you
			burly offspring and admired her great breasts because you felt
			that she would give  good milk to her children and yours. </p>
		<p>—Then MacCann is a sulphuryellow liar, said Lynch
			energetically. </p>
		<p>—There remains another way out, said Stephen, laughing. </p>
		<p>—To wit? said Lynch. </p>
		<p>—This hypothesis, Stephen began. </p>
		<p>A long dray laden with old iron came round the corner of
			sir Patrick Dun's hospital covering the end of Stephen's
			speech with the harsh roar of jangled and rattling metal.
			Lynch closed his ears and gave out oath after oath till the dray
			had passed. Then he turned on his heel rudely. Stephen turned
			also and waited for a few moments till his companion's illhumour
			had had its vent. </p>
		<p>—This hypothesis, Stephen repeated, is the other way out:
			that, though the same object may not seem beautiful to all
			people, all people who admire a beautiful object find in it
			certain relations which satisfy and coincide with the stages
			themselves of all esthetic apprehension. These relations of the
			sensible, visible to you through one form and to me through
			another, must be therefore the necessary qualities of beauty.
			Now, we can return to our old friend saint Thomas for another
			pennyworth of wisdom. </p>
		<p>Lynch laughed. </p>
		<p>—It amuses me vastly, he said, to hear you quoting him
			time after time like a jolly round friar. Are you laughing in
			your sleeve? </p>
		<p>—MacAlister, answered Stephen, would call my esthetic
			theory applied Aquinas. So far as this side of esthetic philosophy
			extends Aquinas will carry me all along the line. When we
			come to the phenomena of artistic conception, artistic gestation
			and artistic reproduction I require a new terminology and
			a new personal experience. </p>
		<p>—Of course, said Lynch. After all Aquinas, in spite of his
			intellect,  was exactly a good round  friar. But you will tell me
			about the new personal experience and new terminology some
			other day. Hurry up and finish the first part. </p>
		<p>—Who knows? said Stephen, smiling. Perhaps Aquinas
			would understand me better than you. He was a poet himself.
			He wrote a hymn for Maundy Thursday. It begins with the
			words <seg xml:lang="la">Pange lingua gloriosi</seg>. They say it is the highest glory
			of the hymnal. It is an intricate and soothing hymn.  I like it:
			but there is no hymn that can be put beside that mournful and
			majestic processional song, the <seg xml:lang="la">Vexilla Regis</seg> of <seg xml:lang="la">Venantius
			Fortunatus</seg>. </p>
		<p>Lynch began to sing softly and solemnly in a deep bass
			voice: </p>

		<lg type="song" xml:lang="la">
				<l>Impleta sunt quae concinit </l>
				<l>David fideli carmine </l>
				<l>Dicendo nationibus </l>
				<l>Regnavit a ligno Deus. </l>
		</lg>

		<p>—That's great! he said, well pleased. Great music! </p>
		<p>They turned into Lower Mount Street. A few steps from the
			corner a fat young man, wearing a silk neckcloth, saluted them
			and stopped. </p>
		<p>—Did you hear the results of the exams? he asked. Griffin
			was plucked. Halpin and O'Flynn are through the home civil.
			Moonan got fifth place in the Indian. O'Shaughnessy got
			fourteenth. The Irish fellows in Clarke's gave them a feed last
			night. They all ate curry. </p>
		<p>His pallid bloated face expressed benevolent malice and, as
			he had advanced through his tidings of success, his small
			fatencircled eyes vanished out of sight and his weak wheezing
			voice out of hearing. </p>
		<p>In reply to a question of Stephen's his eyes and his voice
			came forth again from their lurkingplaces. </p>
		<p>—Yes, MacCullagh and I, he said. He's taking pure mathematics
			and I'm taking constitutional history. There are twenty
			subjects. I'm taking botany too. You know I'm a member of
			the field club. </p>
		<p>He drew back from the other two in a stately fashion and
			placed a plump woollengloved hand on his breast, from which
			muttered wheezing laughter at once broke forth. </p>
		<p>—Bring us a few turnips and onions the next time you go
			out, said Stephen drily, to make a stew. </p>
		<p>The fat student laughed indulgently and said: </p>
		<p>—We are all  highly respectable people in the field club.
			Last Saturday we went out to Glenmalure, seven of us. </p>
		<p>—With women, Donovan? said Lynch. </p>
		<p>Donovan again laid his hand on his chest and said: </p>
		<p>—Our end is the acquisition of knowledge. </p>
		<p>Then he said quickly: </p>
		<p>—I hear you are writing some essay about esthetics. </p>
		<p>Stephen made a vague gesture of denial. </p>
		<p>—Goethe and Lessing, said Donovan, have written a lot on
			that subject, the classical school and the romantic school and
			all that. The <emph>Laocoon</emph> interested me very much when I read it.
			Of course it is idealistic, German, ultraprofound. </p>
		<p>Neither of the others spoke. Donovan took leave of them
			urbanely. </p>
		<p>—I must go, he said softly and benevolently. I have a
			strong suspicion, amounting almost to a conviction, that my
			sister intended to make pancakes today for the dinner of the
			Donovan family. </p>
		<p>—Goodbye, Stephen said in his wake. Don't forget the
			turnips for me and my mate. </p>
		<p>Lynch gazed after him, his lip curling in slow scorn till his
			face resembled a devil's mask: </p>
		<p>—To think that that yellow pancakeeating excrement can
			get a good job, he said at length, and I have to smoke cheap
			cigarettes! </p>
		<p>They turned their faces towards Merrion Square and went
			on for a little in silence. </p>
		<p>—To finish what I was saying about beauty, said Stephen,
			the most satisfying relations of the sensible must therefore
			correspond to the necessary phases of artistic apprehension.
			Find these and you find the qualities of universal beauty.
			Aquinas says: <seg xml:lang="la">ad pulcritudinem tria requiruntur, integritas,
			consonantia, claritas</seg>. I translate it so: <emph>Three things are needed
			for beauty, wholeness, harmony and radiance</emph>. Do these correspond
			to the phases of apprehension? Are you following? </p>
		<p>—Of course, I am, said Lynch. If you think I have an
			excrementitious intelligence run after Donovan and ask him to
			listen to you. </p>
		<p>Stephen pointed to a basket which a butcher's boy had
			slung inverted on his head. </p>
		<p>—Look at that basket, he said. </p>
		<p>—I see it, said Lynch. </p>
		<p>—In order to see that basket, said Stephen, your mind first
			of all separates the basket from the rest of the visible universe
			which is not the basket. The first phase of apprehension is a
			bounding line drawn about the object to be apprehended. An
			esthetic image is presented to us either in space or in time.
			What is audible is presented in time, what is visible is presented
			in space. But, temporal or spatial, the esthetic image is
			first luminously apprehended as selfbounded and selfcontained
			upon the immeasurable background of space or time
			which is not it. You apprehend it as > thing. You see it as
			one whole. You apprehend its wholeness. That is <seg xml:lang="la">integritas</seg>. </p>
		<p>—Bull's eye! said Lynch, laughing. Go on. </p>
		<p>—Then, said Stephen, you pass from point to point, led by
			its formal lines; you apprehend it as balanced part against part
			within its limits; you feel the rhythm of its structure. In other
			words the synthesis of immediate perception is followed by
			the analysis of apprehension. Having first felt that it is >
			thing you feel now that it is a <emph>thing</emph>. You apprehend it as
			complex, multiple, divisible, separable, made up of its parts,
			the result of its parts and their sum, harmonious. That is
			<seg xml:lang="la">consonantia</seg>.</p>
		<p>—Bull's eye again! said Lynch wittily. Tell me now what is
			<seg xml:lang="la">claritas</seg> and you win the cigar. </p>
		<p>—The connotation of the word, Stephen said, is rather
			vague. Aquinas uses a term which seems to be inexact. It
			baffled me for a long time. It would lead you to believe that
			he had in mind symbolism or idealism, the supreme quality of
			beauty being a light from some other world, the idea of which
			the matter is but the shadow, the reality of which it is but the
			symbol. I thought he might mean that <seg xml:lang="la">claritas</seg> is the artistic
			discovery and representation of the divine purpose in anything
			or a force of generalisation which would make the esthetic
			image a universal one, make it outshine its proper conditions.
			But that is literary talk. I understand it so. When you have
			apprehended that basket as one thing and have then  analysed
			it according to its form and apprehended it as a thing you
			make the only synthesis which is logically and esthetically
			permissible. You see that it is that thing which it is and no
			other thing. The radiance of which he speaks is the scholastic
			<seg xml:lang="la">quidditas</seg>, the <emph>whatness</emph> of a thing. This supreme quality is
			felt by the artist when the esthetic image is first conceived in his
			imagination. The mind in that mysterious instant Shelley
			likened beautifully to a fading coal. The instant wherein that
			supreme quality of beauty, the clear radiance of the esthetic
			image, is apprehended luminously by the mind which has been
			arrested by its wholeness and fascinated by its harmony is the
			luminous silent stasis of esthetic pleasure, a spiritual state very
			like to that cardiac condition which the Italian physiologist
			Luigi Galvani, using a phrase almost as beautiful as Shelley's,
			called the enchantment of the heart. </p>
		<p>Stephen paused and, though his companion did not speak,
			felt that his words had called up around them a thoughtenchanted
			silence. </p>
		<p>—What I have said, he began again, refers to beauty in the
			wider sense of the word, in the sense which the word has in
			the literary tradition. In the marketplace it has another sense.
			When we speak of beauty in the second sense of the term our
			judgment is influenced in the first place by the art itself and by
			the form of that art. The image, it is clear, must be set between
			the mind or senses of the  artist himself and the mind or
			senses of others. If you bear this in memory you will see that
			art necessarily divides itself into three forms progressing from
			one to the next. These forms are: the lyrical form, the form
			wherein the artist presents his image in immediate relation to
			himself; the epical form, the form wherein he presents his
			image in mediate relation to himself and to others; the dramatic
			form, the form wherein he presents his image in immediate
			relation to others. </p>
		<p>—That you told me a few nights ago, said Lynch, and we
			began the famous discussion. </p>
		<p>—I have a book at home, said Stephen, in which I have
			written down questions which are more amusing than yours
			were. In finding the answers to them I found the theory of
			esthetic which I am trying to explain. Here are some questions
			I set myself: <emph>Is a chair finely made tragic or comic? Is the
			portrait of Mona Lisa good if I desire to see it? Is the bust of
			Sir Philip Crampton lyrical, epical or dramatic? Can excrement
			or a child or a louse be a work of art? If not, why not?</emph> </p>
		<p>—Why not, indeed? said Lynch, laughing. </p>
		<p>—<emph>If a man hacking in fury at a block of wood</emph>, Stephen
			continued, <emph>of art? If not, why not?</emph> </p>
		<p>—That's a lovely one, said  Lynch, laughing again. That has
			the true scholastic stink. </p>
		<p>—Lessing, said Stephen, should not have taken a group of
			statues to write of. The art, being inferior, does not present the
			forms I spoke of distinguished clearly one from another. Even
			in literature, the highest and most spiritual art, the forms are
			often confused. The lyrical form is in fact the simplest verbal
			vesture of an instant of emotion, a rhythmical cry such as ages
			ago cheered on the man who pulled at the oar or dragged
			stones up a slope. He who utters it is more conscious of the
			instant of emotion than of himself as feeling emotion. The
			simplest epical form is seen emerging out of lyrical literature
			when the artist prolongs and broods upon himself as the
			centre of an epical event and this form progresses till the
			centre of emotional gravity is equidistant from the artist
			himself and from others. The narrative is no longer purely
			personal. The personality of the artist passes into the narration
			itself, flowing round and round the persons and the action
			like a vital sea. This progress you will see easily in that old
			English ballad which begins in the first person
			and ends in the third person. The dramatic form is reached
			when the vitality which has flowed and eddied round each
			person fills every person with such vital force that he or she
			assumes a proper and intangible esthetic life. The personality
			of the artist, at first a cry or a cadence or a mood and then
			a fluid and lambent narrative, finally refines itself out of existence,
			impersonalises itself, so to speak. The esthetic image in
			the dramatic form is life purified in and reprojected from the
			human imagination. The mystery of esthetic like that of material
			creation is accomplished. The artist, like the God of the
			creation, remains within or behind or beyond or above his
			handiwork, invisible, refined out of existence, indifferent,
			paring his fingernails. </p>
		<p>—Trying to refine them also out of existence, said Lynch. </p>
		<p>A fine rain began to fall from the high veiled sky and they
			turned into the duke's lawn, to reach the national library
			before the shower came. </p>
		<p>—What do you mean, Lynch asked surlily, by prating
			about beauty and the imagination in this miserable Godforsaken
			island? No wonder the artist retired within or behind
			his handiwork after having perpetrated this country. </p>
		<p>The rain fell faster. When they passed through the passage
			beside the royal Irish academy they found many students
			sheltering under the arcade of the library. Cranly, leaning
			against a pillar, was picking his teeth with a sharpened match,
			listening to some companions. Some girls stood near the
			entrance door. Lynch whispered to Stephen: </p>
		<p>—Your beloved is  here. </p>
		<p>Stephen took his place silently on the step below the group
			of students, heedless of the rain which fell fast, turning his
			eyes towards her  from time to time. She too stood silently
			among her companions. She has no priest to flirt with, he
			thought with conscious bitterness, remembering how he had
			seen her last. Lynch was right. His mind, emptied of theory
			and courage, lapsed back into a listless peace. </p>
		<p>He heard the students talking among themselves. They
			spoke of two friends who had passed the final medical examination,
			of the chances of getting places on ocean liners, of
			poor and rich practices. </p>
		<p>—That's all a  bubble. An Irish country practice is better. </p>
		<p>—Hynes was two years in Liverpool and he says the same.
			A frightful hole he said it was. Nothing but midwifery cases.
			Half a crown cases. </p>
		<p>—Do you mean to say it is better to have a job here in the
			country than in a rich city like that? I know a fellow ... </p>
		<p>—Hynes has no brains. He got through by stewing, pure
			stewing. </p>
		<p>—Don't mind him. There's  plenty of money to be made in a
			big commercial city. </p>
		<p>—Depends on the practice. </p>
		<p>—<seg xml:lang="la">Ego credo ut vita pauperum est simpliciter atrox, simpliciter
			sanguinarius atrox, in Liverpoolio.</seg> </p>
		<p>Their voices reached his ears as if from a distance in interrupted
			pulsation. She was preparing to go away with her
			companions. </p>
		<p>The quick light shower had drawn off, tarrying in clusters of
			diamonds among the shrubs of the quadrangle where an
			exhalation  was breathed forth by the blackened earth. Their
			trim boots prattled as they stood on the steps of the colonnade,
			talking quietly and gaily, glancing at the clouds, holding
			their umbrellas at cunning angles against the few last raindrops,
			closing them again, holding their skirts demurely. </p>
		<p>And if he had judged her harshly? If her life were a simple
			rosary of hours, her life simple and strange as a bird's life, gay
			in the morning, restless all day, tired at sundown? Her heart
			simple and wilful  as a bird's heart? </p>

	<div n="5.2" type="section">

		<p>Towards dawn he awoke. O what sweet music! His soul
			was all dewy wet. Over his limbs in sleep pale cool waves of
			light had passed. He lay still, as if his soul lay amid cool waters,
			conscious of faint sweet music. His mind was waking
			slowly to a tremulous morning knowledge, a morning inspiration.
			A spirit filled him, pure as the purest water, sweet as
			dew, moving as music. But how faintly it was inbreathed, how
			passionlessly, as if the seraphim themselves were breathing
			upon him! His soul was waking slowly, fearing to awake
			wholly. It was that windless hour of dawn when madness
			wakes and strange plants open to the light and the moth flies
			forth silently. </p>
		<p>An enchantment of the heart! The night had been enchanted.
			In a dream or vision he had known the ecstasy of
			seraphic life. Was it an instant of enchantment only or long
			hours and days and years and ages? </p>
		<p>The instant of inspiration seemed now to be reflected from
			all sides at once from a multitude of cloudy circumstance of
			what had happened or of what might have happened. The
			instant flashed forth like a point of light and now from cloud
			on cloud of vague circumstance confused form  was veiling
			softly its afterglow. O! In the virgin womb of the imagination
			the word was made flesh. Gabriel the  seraph had come to the
			virgin's chamber. An afterglow deepened within his spirit,
			whence the white flame had passed, deepening to a rose and
			ardent light. That rose and ardent light was her strange wilful
			heart, strange that no man had known or would know, wilful
			from before the beginning of the world: and lured by that
			ardent roselike glow the choirs of the seraphim were falling
			from heaven. </p>
		<lg>
			<l>Are you not weary of ardent ways, </l>
			<l>Lure of the fallen seraphim? </l>
			<l>Tell no more of enchanted days. </l>
		</lg>
		<p>The verses passed from his mind to his lips and, murmuring
			them over, he felt the rhythmic movement of a villanelle pass
			through them. The roselike glow sent forth its rays of rhyme;
			ways, days, blaze, praise, raise. Its rays burned up the world,
			consumed the hearts of men and angels: the rays from the
			rose that was her wilful heart. </p>
		<lg>
			<l>Your eyes have set man's heart ablaze </l>
			<l>And you have had your will of him. </l>
			<l>Are you not weary of ardent ways? </l>
		</lg>
		<p>And then? The rhythm died away, ceased, began again to
			move and beat. And then? Smoke, incense ascending from the
			altar of the world. </p>
		<lg>
			<l>Above the flame the smoke of praise </l>
			<l>Goes up from ocean rim to rim. </l>
			<l>Tell no more of enchanted days. </l>
		</lg>
		<p>Smoke went up from the whole earth, from the vapoury
			oceans, smoke of her praise. The earth was like a swinging
			smoking swaying censer, a ball of incense, an ellipsoidal ball.
			The rhythm died out at once; the cry of his heart was broken.
			His lips began to murmur the first verses over and over; then
			went on stumbling through half verses, stammering and
			baffled; then stopped. The heart's cry was broken. </p>
		<p>The veiled windless hour had passed and behind the panes
			of the naked window the morning light was gathering. A bell
			beat faintly very far away. A bird twittered; two birds, three.
			The bell and the bird ceased: and the dull white light  spread
			itself east and west, covering the world, covering the roselight
			in his heart. </p>
		<p>Fearing to lose all, he raised himself suddenly on his elbow
			to look for paper and pencil. There was neither on the table;
			only the soupplate he had eaten the rice from for supper and
			the candlestick with its tendrils of tallow and its paper socket,
			singed by the last flame. He stretched his arm wearily towards
			the foot of the bed, groping with his hand in the pockets of the
			coat that hung there. His fingers found a pencil and then a
			cigarette packet.  He  lay back and, tearing open the packet,
			placed the last cigarette on the windowledge and began to
			write out the stanzas of the villanelle in small neat letters on
			the rough cardboard surface. </p>
		<p>Having written them out he lay back on the lumpy pillow,
			murmuring them again. The lumps of knotted flock under his
			head reminded him of the lumps of knotted horsehair in the
			sofa of her parlour on which he used to sit, smiling or serious,
			asking himself why he had come, displeased with her and with
			himself, confounded by the print of the Sacred Heart above
			the untenanted sideboard. He saw her approach him in a lull
			of the talk and beg him to sing one of his curious songs. Then
			he saw himself sitting at the old piano, striking chords softly
			from its speckled keys and singing, amid the talk which had
			risen again in the room, to her who leaned beside the mantelpiece
			a dainty song of the Elizabethans, a sad and sweet loth
			to depart, the victory chant of Agincourt, the happy air of
			Greensleeves. While he sang and she listened, or feigned to
			listen, his heart was at rest but when the quaint old songs had
			ended and he heard again the voices in the room he remembered
			his own sarcasm: the house where young men are called
			by their christian names a little too soon. </p>
		<p>At certain instants her eyes seemed about to trust him but
			he had waited in vain. She passed now dancing lightly across
			his memory as she had been that night at the carnival ball, her
			white dress a little lifted, a white spray nodding in her hair.
			She danced lightly in the round. She was dancing towards him
			and, as she came, her eyes were a little averted and a faint
			glow was on her cheek. At the pause in the chain of hands her
			hand had lain in his an instant, a soft merchandise. </p>
		<p>—You are a great stranger now. </p>
		<p>—Yes. I was born to be a monk. </p>
		<p>—I am afraid you are a heretic. </p>
		<p>—Are you much afraid? </p>
		<p>For answer she had danced away from him along the chain
			of hands, dancing lightly and discreetly, giving herself to none.
			The white spray nodded to her dancing and when she was in
			shadow the glow was deeper on her cheek. </p>
		<p>A monk! His own image started forth a profaner of the
			cloister, a heretic franciscan, willing and willing not to serve,
			spinning like Gherardino da Borgo San Donnino, a lithe web
			of sophistry and whispering in her ear. </p>
		<p>No, it was not his image. It was like the image of the young
			priest in whose company he had seen her last, looking at him
			out of dove's eyes, toying with the pages of her Irish phrasebook. </p>
		<p>—Yes, yes, the ladies are coming round to us. I can see it
			every day. The ladies are with us. The best helpers the language
			has. </p>
		<p>—And the church, Father Moran? </p>
		<p>—The church too. Coming round too. The work is going
			ahead there too. Don't fret about the church. </p>
		<p>Bah! he had done well to leave the room in disdain. He had
			done well not to salute her on the steps of the library. He had
			done well to leave her to flirt with her priest, to toy with a
			church which was the scullerymaid of christendom. </p>
		<p>Rude brutal anger routed the last lingering instant of ecstasy
			from his soul. It broke up violently her fair image and
			flung the fragments on all sides. On all sides distorted
			reflections of her image started from his memory: the flower-girl
			in the ragged dress with damp coarse hair and a hoyden's
			face who had called herself his own girl and begged his handsel,
			the kitchengirl in the next house who sang over the clatter
			of her plates with the drawl of a country singer the first bars of
			<emph>By Killarney's Lakes and Fells</emph>, a girl who had laughed gaily to
			see him stumble when the iron grating in the footpath near
			Cork Hill had caught the broken sole of his shoe, a girl he had
			glanced at, attracted by her small ripe mouth, as she passed
			out of Jacob's biscuit factory, who had cried to him over her
			shoulder: </p>
		<p>—Do you like what you seen of me, straight hair and curly
			eyebrows? </p>
		<p>And yet he felt that, however he might revile and mock her
			image, his anger was also a form of homage. He had left the
			classroom in disdain that was not wholly sincere, feeling that
			perhaps the secret of her race lay behind those dark eyes upon
			which her long lashes flung a quick shadow. He had told
			himself bitterly as he walked through the streets that she was a
			figure of the womanhood of her country, a batlike soul waking
			to the consciousness of itself in darkness and secrecy and
			loneliness, tarrying awhile, loveless and sinless, with her mild
			lover and leaving him to whisper of innocent transgressions in
			the latticed ear of a priest. His anger against her found vent in
			coarse railing at her paramour, whose name and voice and
			features offended his baffled pride: a priested peasant, with a
			brother a policeman in Dublin and a brother a potboy in
			Moycullen. To him she would unveil her soul's shy nakedness,
			to one who was but schooled in the discharging of a formal
			rite rather than to him, a priest of eternal imagination, transmuting
			the daily bread of experience into the radiant body of
			everliving life. </p>
		<p>The radiant image of the eucharist united again in an instant
			his bitter and despairing thoughts, their cries arising
			unbroken in a hymn of thanksgiving. </p>
		<lg>
			<l>Our broken cries and mournful lays </l>
			<l>Rise in one eucharistic hymn. </l>
			<l>Are you not weary of ardent ways? </l>
			<l>While sacrificing hands upraise </l>
			<l>The chalice flowing to the brim, </l>
			<l>Tell no more of enchanted days. </l>
		</lg>
		<p>He spoke the verses aloud from the first lines till the music
			and rhythm suffused his mind, turning it to quiet indulgence;
			then copied them painfully to feel them the better by seeing
			them; then lay back on his bolster. </p>
		<p>The full morning light had come. No sound was to be
			heard: but he knew that all around him life was about to
			awaken in common noises, hoarse voices, sleepy prayers.
			Shrinking from that life he turned towards the wall, making a
			cowl of the blanket and staring at the great overblown scarlet
			flowers of the tattered wallpaper. He tried to warm his perishing
			joy in their scarlet glow, imagining a roseway from where
			he lay upwards to heaven all strewn  with scarlet flowers.
			Weary! Weary! He too was weary of ardent ways. </p>
		<p>A gradual warmth, a languorous weariness passed over
			him, descending along his spine from his closely cowled  head.
			He felt it descend and, seeing himself as he lay, smiled. Soon
			he would sleep. </p>
		<p>He had written verses for her again after ten years. Ten
			years before she had worn her shawl cowlwise about her head,
			sending sprays of her warm breath into the night air, tapping
			her foot upon the glassy road. It was the last tram; the lank
			brown horses knew it and shook their bells to the clear night
			in admonition. The conductor talked with the driver, both
			nodding often in the green light of the lamp. They stood on
			the steps of the tram, he on the upper, she on the lower. She
			came up to his step many times between their phrases and
			went down again and once or twice remained beside him
			forgetting to go down and then went down. Let be! Let be! </p>
		<p>Ten years from that wisdom of children to his folly. If he
			sent her the verses? They would be read out at breakfast amid
			the tapping of eggshells. Folly indeed! The brothers would
			laugh and try to wrest the page from each other with their
			strong hard fingers. The suave priest, her uncle, seated in
			his armchair, would hold the page at arm's length, read it
			smiling and approve of the literary form. </p>
		<p>No, no: that was folly. Even if he sent her the verses she
			would not show them to others. No, no: she could not. </p>
		<p>He began to feel that he had wronged her. A sense of her
			innocence moved him almost to pity her, an innocence he had
			never understood till he had come to the knowledge of it
			through sin, an innocence which she too had not understood
			while she was innocent or before the strange humiliation of
			her nature had first come upon her. Then first her soul had
			begun to live as his soul had when he had first sinned: and a
			tender compassion filled his heart as he remembered her frail
			pallor and her eyes, humbled and saddened by the dark shame
			of womanhood. </p>
		<p>While his soul had passed from ecstasy to languor where
			had she been? Might it be, in the mysterious ways of spiritual
			life, that her soul at those same moments had been conscious
			of his homage? It might be. </p>
		<p>A glow of desire kindled again his soul and fired and
			fulfilled all his body. Conscious of his desire she was waking
			from odorous sleep, the temptress of his villanelle. Her eyes,
			dark and with a look of languor, were opening to his eyes. Her

		<p>What birds were they? He stood on the steps of the library
			to look at them, leaning wearily on his ashplant. They flew
			round and round the jutting shoulder of a house in Molesworth
			Street. The air of the late March evening made clear
			their flight, their dark darting quivering bodies flying clearly
			against the sky as against a limphung cloth of smoky tenuous
			blue. </p>
		<p>He watched their flight; bird after bird: a dark flash, a
			swerve, a flash again, a dart aside, a curve, a flutter of wings.
			He tried to count them before all their darting quivering
			bodies passed: six, ten, eleven: and wondered were they odd
			or even in number. Twelve, thirteen: for two came wheeling
			down from the upper sky. They were flying high and low but
			ever round and round in straight and curving lines and ever
			flying from left to right, circling about a temple of air. </p>
		<p>He  listened to the cries: like the squeak of mice behind the
			wainscot: a shrill twofold note. But the notes were long and
			shrill and whirring, unlike the cry of vermin, falling a third or
			a fourth and trilled as the flying beaks clove the air. Their cry
			was shrill and clear and fine and falling like threads of silken
			light unwound from whirring spools. </p>
		<p>The inhuman clamour soothed his ears in which his
			mother's sobs and reproaches murmured insistently and the
			dark frail quivering bodies wheeling and fluttering and swerving
			round an airy temple of the tenuous sky soothed his eyes
			which still saw the image of his mother's face. </p>
		<p>Why was he gazing upwards from the steps of the porch,
			hearing their shrill twofold cry, watching their flight? For an
			augury of good or evil? A phrase of Cornelius Agrippa flew
			through his mind and then there flew hither and thither shapeless
			thoughts from Swedenborg on the correspondence of
			birds to things of the intellect and of how the creatures of the
			air have their knowledge and know their times and seasons
			because they, unlike man, are in the order of their life and
			have not perverted that order by reason. </p>
		<p>And for ages men had gazed upward as he was gazing at
			birds in flight. The colonnade above him made him think
			vaguely of an ancient temple and the ashplant on which he
			leaned wearily of the curved stick of an augur. A sense of fear
			of the unknown moved in the heart of his weariness, a fear of
			symbols and portents, of the hawklike man whose name he
			bore soaring out of his captivity on osierwoven wings, of
			Thoth, the god of writers, writing with a reed upon a tablet
			and bearing on his narrow ibis head the cusped moon. </p>
		<p>He smiled as he thought of the god's image for it made him
			think of a bottlenosed judge in a wig, putting commas into a
			document which he held at arm's length and he knew that he
			would not have remembered the god's name but that it was
			like an Irish oath. It was folly. But was it for this folly that he
			was about to leave for ever the house of prayer and prudence
			into which he had been born and the order of life out of which
			he had come? </p>
		<p>They came back with shrill cries over the jutting shoulder of
			the house, flying darkly against the fading air. What birds were
			they? He thought that they must be swallows who had come
			back from the south. Then he was to go away for they were
			birds ever going and coming, building ever an unlasting home
			under the eaves of men's houses and ever leaving the homes
			they had built to wander. </p>
		<lg>
			<l>Bend down your faces, Oona and Aleel, </l>
			<l>I gaze upon them as the swallow gazes </l>
			<l>Upon the nest under the eave before </l>
			<l>He wander the loud waters. </l>
		</lg>
		<p>A soft liquid joy like the noise of many waters flowed over
			his memory and he felt in his heart the soft peace of silent
			spaces of fading tenuous sky above the waters, of oceanic
			silence, of swallows flying through the seadusk over the flowing
			waters. </p>
		<p>A soft liquid joy flowed through the words where the soft
			long vowels hurtled noiselessly and fell away, lapping and
			flowing back and ever shaking the white bells of their waves in
			mute chime and mute peal and soft low swooning cry; and he
			felt that the augury he had sought in the wheeling darting
			birds and in the pale space of sky above him had come forth
			from his heart like a bird from a turret quietly and swiftly. </p>
		<p>Symbol of departure or of loneliness? The verses crooned in
			the ear of his memory composed slowly before his remembering
			eyes the scene of the hall on the night of the opening of the
			national theatre. He was alone at the side of the balcony,
			looking out of jaded eyes at the culture of Dublin in the stalls
			and at the tawdry scenecloths and human dolls framed by the
			garish lamps of the stage. A burly policeman sweated behind
			him and seemed at every moment about to act. The catcalls
			and hisses and mocking cries ran in rude gusts round the hall
			from his scattered fellowstudents. </p>
		<p>—A libel on Ireland! </p>
		<p>—Made in Germany! </p>
		<p>—Blasphemy! </p>
		<p>—We never sold our faith! </p>
		<p>—No  Irish woman ever did it! </p>
		<p>—We want no amateur atheists. </p>
		<p>—We want no budding buddhists. </p>
		<p>A sudden swift hiss fell from the windows above him and he
			knew that the electric lamps had been switched on in the
			reader's room. He turned into the pillared  hall, now calmly lit,
			went up the staircase and passed in through the clicking turnstile. </p>
		<p>Cranly was sitting over near the dictionaries. A thick book,
			opened at the frontispiece, lay before him on the wooden rest.
			He leaned back in his chair, inclining his ear like that of a
			confessor to the face of the medical student who was reading
			to him a problem from the chess page of a journal. Stephen sat
			down at his right and the priest at the other side of the  table
			closed his copy of <emph>The Tablet</emph> with an angry snap and stood
			up. </p>
		<p>Cranly gazed after him blandly and vaguely. The medical
			student went on in a softer voice: </p>
		<p>—Pawn to king's fourth. </p>
		<p>—We had better go, Dixon, said Stephen in warning. He
			has gone to complain. </p>
		<p>Dixon folded the journal and rose with dignity, saying: </p>
		<p>—Our men retired in good order. </p>
		<p>—With guns and cattle, added Stephen, pointing to the
			titlepage of Cranly's book on which was printed <emph>Diseases of
			the Ox</emph>. </p>
		<p>As they passed through a lane of the tables Stephen said: </p>
		<p>—Cranly, I want to speak to you. </p>
		<p>Cranly did not answer or turn. He laid his book on the
			counter and passed out, his wellshod feet sounding flatly on
			the floor. On the staircase he paused and gazing absently at
			Dixon repeated: </p>
		<p>—Pawn to king's bloody fourth. </p>
		<p>—Put it that way if you like, Dixon said. </p>
		<p>He had a quiet toneless voice and urbane manners and on a
			finger of his plump clean hand he displayed at moments a
			signet ring. </p>
		<p>As they crossed the hall a man of dwarfish stature came
			towards them. Under the dome of his tiny hat his unshaven
			face began to smile with pleasure and he was heard to murmur.
			The eyes were melancholy as those of a monkey. </p>
		<p>—Good evening, captain, said Cranly, halting. </p>
		<p>—Good evening, gentlemen, said the stubblegrown monkeyish
			face. </p>
		<p>—Warm weather for March, said Cranly. They have the
			windows open upstairs. </p>
		<p>Dixon smiled and turned his ring. The blackish monkeypuckered
			face pursed its human mouth with gentle pleasure:
			and its voice purred: </p>
		<p>—Delightful weather for March. Simply delightful. </p>
		<p>—There are two nice young ladies upstairs, captain, tired of
			waiting, Dixon said. </p>
		<p>Cranly smiled and said kindly: </p>
		<p>—The captain has only one love: sir Walter Scott. Isn't that
			so, captain? </p>
		<p>—What are you reading now, captain? Dixon asked. <emph>The
			Bride of Lammermoor?</emph> </p>
		<p>—I love old Scott, the flexible lips said. I think he writes
			something lovely. There is no writer can touch sir Walter
			Scott. </p>
		<p>He moved a thin shrunken brown hand gently in the air in
			time to his praise and his thin quick eyelids beat often over his
			sad eyes. </p>
		<p>Sadder to Stephen's ear was his speech: a genteel accent,
			low and moist, marred by errors: and listening to it he wondered
			was the story true and was the thin blood that flowed in
			his shrunken frame noble and come of an incestuous  love? </p>
		<p>The park trees were heavy with rain and rain fell still and
			ever in the lake, lying grey like a shield. A game of swans flew
			there and the water and the shore beneath were fouled with
			their greenwhite slime. They embraced softly, impelled by the
			grey rainy light, the wet silent trees, the shieldlike witnessing
			lake, the swans. They embraced without joy or passion, his
			arm about his sister's neck. A grey woollen cloak was
			wrapped athwart her from her shoulder to her waist: and her
			fair head was bent in willing shame. He had loose redbrown
			hair and tender shapely strong freckled hands. Face. There
			was no face seen. The brother's face was bent upon her fair
			rainfragrant hair. The hand freckled and strong and shapely
			and caressing was Davin's hand. </p>
		<p>He frowned angrily upon his thought and on the shrivelled
			mannikin who had called it forth. His father's gibes at the
			Bantry gang leaped out of his memory. He held them at a
			distance and brooded uneasily on his own thought again. Why
			were they not  Cranly's hands? Had Davin's simplicity and
			innocence stung him more secretly? </p>
		<p>He walked on across the hall with Dixon, leaving Cranly to
			take leave elaborately of the dwarf. </p>
		<p>Under the colonnade Temple was standing in the midst of a
			little group of students. One of them cried: </p>
		<p>—Dixon, come over till you hear. Temple is in grand form. </p>
		<p>Temple turned on him his dark gipsy eyes. </p>
		<p>—You're a hypocrite, O'Keeffe, he said, and Dixon's a
			smiler. By hell, I think that's a good literary expression. </p>
		<p>He laughed slily, looking in Stephen's face, repeating: </p>
		<p>—By hell, I'm delighted with that name. A smiler. </p>
		<p>A stout student who stood below them on the steps said: </p>
		<p>—Come back to the mistress, Temple. We want to hear
			about that. </p>
		<p>—He had, faith, Temple said. And he was a married man
			too. And all the priests used to be dining there. By hell, I think
			they all had a touch. </p>
		<p>—We shall call it riding a hack to spare the hunter, said
			Dixon. </p>
		<p>—Tell us, Temple, O'Keeffe said, how many quarts of
			porter have you in you? </p>
		<p>—All your intellectual soul is in that phrase, O'Keeffe, said
			Temple with open scorn. </p>
		<p>He moved with a shambling gait round the group and spoke
			to Stephen. </p>
		<p>—Did you know that the Forsters are the kings of Belgium?
			he asked. </p>
		<p>Cranly came out through the door of the entrance hall, his
			hat thrust back on the nape of his neck and picking his teeth
			with care. </p>
		<p>—And here's the wiseacre, said Temple. Do you know that
			about the Forsters? </p>
		<p>He paused for an answer. Cranly dislodged a figseed from
			his teeth on the point of his rude toothpick and gazed at it
			intently. </p>
		<p>—The Forster  family, Temple said, is descended from Baldwin
			the First, king of Flanders. He was called the Forester.
			Forester and Forster are the same name. A descendant of
			Baldwin the First, captain Francis Forster, settled in Ireland
			and married the daughter of the last chieftain of Clanbrassil.
			Then there are the Blake Forsters. That's a different branch. </p>
		<p>—From Baldhead, king of Flanders, Cranly repeated,
			rooting again deliberately at his gleaming uncovered teeth. </p>
		<p>—Where did you pick up all that history? O'Keeffe asked. </p>
		<p>—I know all the history of your family too, Temple said,
			turning to Stephen. Do you know what Giraldus Cambrensis
			says about your family? </p>
		<p>—Is he descended from Baldwin too? asked a tall consumptive
			student with dark eyes. </p>
		<p>—Baldhead, Cranly repeated, sucking at a crevice in his
			teeth. </p>
		<p>—<seg xml:lang="la">Pernobilis et pervetusta familia</seg>, Temple said to Stephen. </p>
		<p>The stout student who stood below them on the steps farted
			briefly. Dixon turned towards him saying in a soft voice: </p>
		<p>—Did an angel speak? </p>
		<p>Cranly turned also and said vehemently but without anger: </p>
		<p>—Goggins, you're the flamingest dirty devil I ever met, do
			you know. </p>
		<p>—I had it on my mind to say that, Goggins answered
			firmly. It did no one any harm, did it? </p>
		<p>—We hope, Dixon said suavely, that it was not of the kind
			known to science as a <seg xml:lang="la">paulo post futurum</seg>. </p>
		<p>—Didn't I tell you he was a smiler? said Temple, turning
			right and left. Didn't I give him that name? </p>
		<p>—You did. We're not deaf, said the tall consumptive. </p>
		<p>Cranly still frowned at the stout student below him. Then,
			with a snort of disgust, he shoved him violently down the
			steps. </p>
		<p>—Go away from here, he said rudely. Go away, you
			stinkpot. And you are a stinkpot. </p>
		<p>Goggins skipped down on to the gravel and at once returned
			to his place with good humour. Temple turned back to
			Stephen and asked: </p>
		<p>—Do you believe in the law of heredity? </p>
		<p>—Are you drunk or what are you or what are you trying to
			say? asked Cranly, facing round on him with an expression of
			wonder. </p>
		<p>—The most profound sentence ever written, Temple said
			with enthusiasm, is the sentence at the end of the zoology.
			Reproduction is the beginning of death. </p>
		<p>He touched Stephen timidly at the elbow and said eagerly: </p>
		<p>—Do you feel how profound that is because you are a
			poet? </p>
		<p>Cranly pointed his long forefinger. </p>
		<p>—Look at him! he said with scorn to the others. Look at
			Ireland's hope! </p>
		<p>They laughed at his words and gesture. Temple turned on
			him bravely, saying: </p>
		<p>—Cranly, you're always sneering at me. I can see that. But
			I am as good as you any day. Do you know what I think about
			you now as compared with myself? </p>
		<p>—My dear man, said Cranly urbanely, you are incapable,
			do you know, absolutely incapable of thinking. </p>
		<p>—But do you know, Temple went on, what I think of you
			and of myself compared together? </p>
		<p>—Out with it, Temple! the stout student cried from the
			steps. Get it out in bits! </p>
		<p>Temple turned right and left, making sudden feeble gestures
			as he spoke. </p>
		<p>—I'm a ballocks, he said, shaking his head in despair. I am.
			And I know I am. And I admit it that I am. </p>
		<p>Dixon patted him lightly on the shoulder and said mildly: </p>
		<p>—And it does you every credit, Temple. </p>
		<p>—But he, Temple said, pointing to Cranly. He is a ballocks
			too like me. Only he doesn't know it. And that's the only
			difference I see. </p>
		<p>A burst of laughter covered his words. But he turned again
			to Stephen and said with a sudden eagerness: </p>
		<p>—That word is a most interesting word. That's the only
			English dual number. Did you know? </p>
		<p>—Is it? Stephen said vaguely. </p>
		<p>He was watching Cranly's firmfeatured suffering face, lit up
			now by a smile of false patience. The gross name had passed
			over it like foul water poured over an old stone image, patient
			of injuries: and, as he watched him, he saw him raise his hat in
			salute and uncover the black hair that stood up stiffly from his
			forehead like an iron crown. </p>
		<p>She passed out from the porch of the library and bowed
			across Stephen in reply to Cranly's greeting. He also? Was
			there not a slight flush on Cranly's cheek? Or had it come
			forth at Temple's words? The light had waned. He could not
			see. </p>
		<p>Did that explain his friend's listless silence, his harsh comments,
			the sudden intrusions of rude speech with which he had
			shattered so often Stephen's ardent wayward confessions?
			Stephen had forgiven freely for he had found this rudeness
			also in himself towards himself. And he remembered an
			evening when he had dismounted from a borrowed creaking
			bicycle to pray to God in a wood near Malahide. He had lifted
			up his arms and spoken in ecstasy to the sombre nave of the
			trees, knowing that he stood on holy ground and in a holy
			hour. And when  two constabularymen had come into sight
			round a bend in the gloomy road he had broken off his prayer
			to whistle loudly an air from the last pantomime. </p>
		<p>He began to beat the frayed end of his ashplant against the
			base of a pillar. Had Cranly not heard him? Yet he could wait.
			The talk about him ceased for a moment: and a soft hiss fell
			again from a window above. But no other sound was in the air
			and the swallows whose flight he had followed with idle eyes
			were sleeping. </p>
		<p>She had passed through the dusk. And therefore the air was
			silent save for one soft hiss that fell. And therefore the tongues
			about him had ceased their babble. Darkness  was falling. </p>
		<l><emph>Darkness falls from the air.</emph> </l>
		<p>A trembling joy, lambent as a faint light, played like a fairy
			host around him. But why? Her passage through the darkening
			air or the verse with its black vowels and its opening
			sound, rich and lutelike? </p>
		<p>He walked away slowly towards the deeper shadows at the
			end of the colonnade, beating the stone softly with his stick to
			hide his revery from the students whom he had left: and
			allowed his mind to summon back to itself the age of Dowland
			and Byrd and Nash. </p>
		<p>Eyes, opening from the darkness of desire, eyes that
			dimmed the breaking east. What was their languid grace but
			the softness of chambering? And what was their shimmer but
			the shimmer of the scum that mantled the cesspool of the
			court of a slobbering Stuart. And he tasted in the language of
			memory ambered wines, dying fallings of sweet airs, the proud
			pavan: and saw with the eyes of memory kind gentlewomen in
			Covent Garden wooing from their balconies with sucking
			mouths and the poxfouled wenches of the taverns and young
			wives that, gaily yielding to their ravishers, clipped and
			clipped again. </p>
		<p>The images he had summoned gave him no pleasure. They
			were secret and enflaming but her image was not entangled by
			them. That was not the way to think of her. It was not even
			the way in which he thought of her. Could his mind then not
			trust itself? Old phrases, sweet only with a disinterred sweetness
			like the figseeds Cranly rooted out of his gleaming teeth. </p>
		<p>It was not thought nor vision though he knew vaguely that
			her figure was passing homeward through the city. Vaguely
			first and then more sharply he smelt her body. A conscious
			unrest seethed in his blood. Yes, it was her body he smelt: a
			wild and languid smell: the tepid limbs over which his music
			had flowed desirously and the secret soft linen upon which her
			flesh distilled odour and a dew. </p>
		<p>A louse crawled over the nape of his neck and, putting his
			thumb and forefinger deftly beneath his loose collar, he caught
			it. He rolled its body, tender yet brittle as a grain of rice,
			between thumb and finger for an instant before he let it fall
			from him and wondered would it live or die. There came to his
			mind a curious phrase from Cornelius a Lapide which said
			that the lice born of human sweat were not created by God
			with the other animals on the sixth day. But the tickling of the
			skin of his neck made his mind raw and red. The life of his
			body, illclad, illfed, louseeaten, made him close his eyelids in a
			sudden spasm of despair: and in the darkness he saw the
			brittle bright bodies of lice falling from the air and turning
			often as they fell. Yes; and it was not darkness that fell from
			the air. It was brightness. </p>
		<l><emph>Brightness falls from the air.</emph> </l>
		<p>He had not even remembered rightly Nash's line. All the
			images it  had awakened were false. His mind bred vermin. His
			thoughts were lice born of the sweat of sloth. </p>
		<p>He came back quickly along the colonnade towards the
			group of students. Well then, let her go and be damned to her.
			She could love some clean athlete who washed himself every
			morning to the waist and had black hair on his chest. Let her. </p>
		<p>Cranly had taken another dried fig from the supply in his
			pocket and was eating it slowly and noisily. Temple sat on the
			pediment of a pillar, leaning back, his cap pulled down on his
			sleepy eyes. A squat young man came out of the porch, a
			leather portfolio tucked under his armpit. He marched towards
			the group, striking the flags with the heels of his boots
			and with the ferule of his heavy umbrella. Then, raising the
			umbrella in salute, he said to all: </p>
		<p>—Good evening, sirs. </p>
		<p>He struck the flags again and tittered while his head trembled
			with a slight nervous movement. The tall consumptive
			student and Dixon and O'Keeffe were speaking in Irish and
			did not answer him. Then, turning to Cranly, he said: </p>
		<p>—Good evening, particularly to you. </p>
		<p>He moved the umbrella in indication and tittered again.
			Cranly, who was still chewing the fig, answered with loud
			movements of his jaws. </p>
		<p>—Good? Yes. It is a good evening. </p>
		<p>The squat student looked at him seriously and shook his
			umbrella gently and reprovingly. </p>
		<p>—I can see, he said, that you are about to make obvious
			remarks. </p>
		<p>—Um, Cranly answered, holding out what remained of the
			halfchewed fig and jerking it towards the squat student's
			mouth in sign that he should eat. </p>
		<p>The squat student did not eat it but, indulging his  special
			humour, said gravely, still tittering and prodding his phrase
			with his  umbrella: </p>
		<p>—Do you intend that ... </p>
		<p>He broke off, pointed bluntly to the munched pulp of the fig
			and said loudly: </p>
		<p>—I allude to that. </p>
		<p>—Um, Cranly said as before. </p>
		<p>—Do you intend that now, the squat student said, as >
			<emph>facto</emph> or, let us say, as so to speak? </p>
		<p>Dixon turned aside from his group, saying: </p>
		<p>—Goggins was waiting for you, Glynn. He has gone round
			to the Adelphi to look for you and Moynihan. What have you
			there? he asked, tapping the portfolio under Glynn's arm. </p>
		<p>—Examination papers, Glynn answered. I give them
			monthly examinations to see that they are profiting by my
			tuition. </p>
		<p>He also tapped the portfolio and coughed gently and smiled. </p>
		<p>—Tuition!  said Cranly rudely. I suppose you mean the
			barefooted children that are taught by a bloody ape like you.
			God help them! </p>
		<p>He bit off the rest of the fig and flung away the butt. </p>
		<p>—I suffer little children to come unto me, Glynn said
			amiably. </p>
		<p>—A bloody ape, Cranly repeated with emphasis, and a
			blasphemous bloody ape! </p>
		<p>Temple stood up and, pushing past Cranly, addressed
			Glynn: </p>
		<p>—That phrase you said now, he said, is from the new
			testament about suffer the children to come to me. </p>
		<p>—Go to sleep again, Temple, said O'Keeffe. </p>
		<p>—Very well, then, Temple continued, still addressing
			Glynn, and if Jesus suffered the children to come why does the
			church send them all to hell if they die unbaptised? Why is
			that? </p>
		<p>—Were you baptised yourself, Temple? the consumptive
			student asked. </p>
		<p>—But why are they sent to hell if Jesus said they were all to
			come? Temple said, his eyes searching in Glynn's eyes. </p>
		<p>Glynn coughed and said gently, holding back with difficulty
			the nervous titter in his voice and moving his umbrella at every
			word: </p>
		<p>—And, as you remark, if it is thus I ask emphatically
			whence comes this thusness. </p>
		<p>—Because the church is cruel like all old sinners, Temple
			said. </p>
		<p>—Are you quite orthodox on that point, Temple? Dixon
			said suavely. </p>
		<p>—Saint Augustine says that about unbaptised children
			going to hell, Temple answered, because he was a cruel old
			sinner too. </p>
		<p>—I bow to you, Dixon said, but I had the impression that
			limbo existed for such cases. </p>
		<p>—Don't argue with him, Dixon, Cranly said brutally. Don't
			talk to him or look at him. Lead him home with a sugan the
			way you'd lead a bleating goat. </p>
		<p>—Limbo! Temple cried. That's a fine invention too. Like
			hell. </p>
		<p>—But with the unpleasantness left out, Dixon said. </p>
		<p>He turned smiling to the others and said: </p>
		<p>—I think I am voicing the opinions of all present in saying
			so much. </p>
		<p>—You are, Glynn said in a firm tone. On that point Ireland
			is united. </p>
		<p>He struck the ferule of his umbrella on the stone floor of the
			colonnade. </p>
		<p>—Hell, Temple said. I can respect that invention of the
			grey spouse of Satan. Hell is Roman, like the walls of the
			Romans, strong and ugly. But what is limbo? </p>
		<p>—Put him back into  the perambulator, Cranly, O'Keeffe
			called out. </p>
		<p>Cranly made a swift step towards Temple, halted, stamping
			his foot, crying as if to a fowl: </p>
		<p>—Hoosh! </p>
		<p>Temple moved away nimbly. </p>
		<p>—Do you know what limbo is? he cried. Do you know what
			we call a notion like that in Roscommon? </p>
		<p>—Hoosh! Blast you! Cranly cried, clapping his hands. </p>
		<p>—Neither my arse nor my elbow! Temple cried out scornfully.
			And that's what I call limbo. </p>
		<p>—Give us that stick here, Cranly said. </p>
		<p>He snatched the ashplant roughly from Stephen's hand and
			sprang down the steps: but Temple, hearing him move in
			pursuit, fled through the dusk like a wild creature, nimble and
			fleetfooted. Cranly's heavy boots were heard loudly charging
			across the quadrangle and then returning heavily, foiled and
			spurning the gravel at each step. </p>
		<p>His step was angry and with an angry abrupt gesture he
			thrust the stick back into Stephen's hand. Stephen felt that his
			anger had another cause but, feigning patience, touched his
			arm slightly and said quietly: </p>
		<p>—Cranly, I told you I wanted to speak to you. Come away. </p>
		<p>Cranly looked at him for a few moments and asked: </p>
		<p>—Now? </p>
		<p>—Yes, now, Stephen said. We can't speak here. Come
			away. </p>
		<p>They crossed the quadrangle together without speaking.
			The birdcall from > whistled softly followed them from
			the steps of the porch. Cranly turned: and Dixon, who had
			whistled, called out: </p>
		<p>—Where are you fellows off to? What about that  game,
			Cranly? </p>
		<p>They parleyed in shouts across the still air about a game of
			billiards to be played in the Adelphi hotel. Stephen walked on
			alone and out into the quiet of Kildare Street. Opposite Maple's
			hotel he stood to wait, patient again. The name of the
			hotel, a colourless polished wood, and its colourless quiet
			front stung him like a glance of polite disdain. He stared
			angrily back at the softly lit drawingroom of the hotel in which
			he imagined the sleek lives of the patricians of Ireland housed
			in calm. They thought of army commissions and land agents:
			peasants greeted them along the roads  in the country: they
			knew the names of certain French dishes and gave orders to
			jarvies in highpitched provincial voices which pierced through
			their skintight accents. </p>
		<p>How could he hit their conscience or how cast his shadow
			over the imaginations of their daughters, before their squires
			begat upon them, that they might breed a race less ignoble
			than their own? And under the deepened dusk he felt the
			thoughts and desires of the race to which he belonged flitting
			like bats, across the dark country lanes,  under trees by the
			edges of streams and near the poolmottled bogs. A woman had
			waited in the doorway as Davin had passed by at night and,
			offering him a cup of milk, had all but wooed him to her bed;
			for Davin had the mild eyes of one who could be secret. But
			him no woman's eyes had wooed. </p>
		<p>His arm was taken in a strong grip and Cranly's voice said: </p>
		<p>—Let us eke go. </p>
		<p>They walked southward in silence. Then Cranly said: </p>
		<p>—That blithering idiot Temple! I swear to Moses, do you
			know, that I'll be the death of that fellow one time. </p>
		<p>But his voice was no longer angry and Stephen wondered
			was he thinking of her greeting to him under the porch. </p>
		<p>They turned to the left and walked on as before. When they
			had gone on so for some time Stephen said: </p>
		<p>—Cranly, I had an unpleasant quarrel this evening. </p>
		<p>—With your people? Cranly asked. </p>
		<p>—With my mother. </p>
		<p>—About religion? </p>
		<p>—Yes, Stephen answered. </p>
		<p>After a pause Cranly asked: </p>
		<p>—What age is your mother? </p>
		<p>—Not old, Stephen said. She wishes me to make my easter
			duty. </p>
		<p>—And will you? </p>
		<p>—I will not, Stephen said. </p>
		<p>—Why not? Cranly said. </p>
		<p>—I will not serve, answered Stephen. </p>
		<p>—That remark was made before, Cranly said calmly. </p>
		<p>—It is made behind now, said Stephen hotly. </p>
		<p>Cranly pressed Stephen's arm, saying: </p>
		<p>—Go easy, my dear man. You're an excitable bloody man,
			do you know. </p>
		<p>He laughed nervously as he spoke and, looking up into
			Stephen's face with moved and friendly eyes, said: </p>
		<p>—Do you know that you are an excitable man? </p>
		<p>—I daresay I am, said Stephen, laughing also. </p>
		<p>Their minds, lately estranged, seemed suddenly to have
			been drawn closer, one to the other. </p>
		<p>—Do you believe in the eucharist? Cranly asked. </p>
		<p>—I do not, Stephen said. </p>
		<p>—Do you disbelieve then? </p>
		<p>—I neither believe in it nor disbelieve in it, Stephen answered. </p>
		<p>—Many persons have doubts, even religious persons, yet
			they overcome them or put them aside, Cranly said. Are your
			doubts on that point too strong? </p>
		<p>—I do not wish to overcome them, Stephen answered. </p>
		<p>Cranly, embarrassed for a moment, took another fig from
			his pocket and was about to eat it when Stephen said: </p>
		<p>—Don't, please. You cannot discuss this question with your
			mouth full of chewed  fig. </p>
		<p>Cranly examined the fig by the light of a lamp under which
			he halted. Then he smelt it with both nostrils, bit a tiny piece,
			spat it out and threw the fig rudely into the gutter. Addressing
			it as it lay, he said: </p>
		<p>—Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire! </p>
		<p>Taking Stephen's arm, he went on again and said: </p>
		<p>—Do you not fear that those words may be spoken to you
			on the day of judgment? </p>
		<p>—What is offered me on the other hand? Stephen asked.
			An eternity of bliss in the company of the dean of studies? </p>
		<p>—Remember, Cranly said, that he would be glorified. </p>
		<p>—Ay, Stephen said somewhat bitterly, bright, agile, impassible
			and, above all, subtle. </p>
		<p>—It is a curious thing, do you know, Cranly said dispassionately,
			how your mind is supersaturated with the religion in
			which you say you disbelieve. Did you believe in it when you
			were at school? I bet you did. </p>
		<p>—I did, Stephen answered. </p>
		<p>—And were you happier then? Cranly asked softly. Happier
			than you are now, for instance? </p>
		<p>—Often happy, Stephen said, and often unhappy. I was
			someone else then. </p>
		<p>—How someone else? What do you mean by that  statement? </p>
		<p>—I mean, said Stephen, that I was not myself as I am now,
			as I had to become. </p>
		<p>—Not as you are now, not as you had to become, Cranly
			repeated. Let me ask you a question. Do you love your
			mother? </p>
		<p>Stephen shook his head slowly. </p>
		<p>—I don't know what your words mean, he said simply. </p>
		<p>—Have you never loved anyone? Cranly asked. </p>
		<p>—Do you mean women? </p>
		<p>—I am not speaking of that, Cranly said in a colder tone. I
			ask you if you ever felt love towards anyone or anything. </p>
		<p>Stephen walked on beside his friend, staring gloomily at the
			footpath. </p>
		<p>—I tried to love God, he said at length. It seems now I
			failed. It is very difficult. I tried to unite my will with the will
			of God instant by instant. In that I did not always fail. I could
			perhaps do that still ... </p>
		<p>Cranly cut him short by asking: </p>
		<p>—Has your mother had a happy life? </p>
		<p>—How do I know? Stephen said. </p>
		<p>—How many children had she? </p>
		<p>—Nine or ten, Stephen answered. Some died. </p>
		<p>—Was your father .... Cranly interrupted himself for an
			instant: and then said: I don't want to pry  into your family
			affairs. But was your father what is called  well-to-do? I mean
			when you were growing up? </p>
		<p>—Yes, Stephen said. </p>
		<p>—What was he? Cranly asked after a pause. </p>
		<p>Stephen began to enumerate glibly his father's attributes. </p>
		<p>—A medical student, an oarsman, a tenor, an amateur
			actor, a shouting politician, a small landlord, a small investor,
			a drinker, a good fellow, a storyteller, somebody's secretary,
			something in a distillery, a taxgatherer, a bankrupt and at
			present a praiser of his own past. </p>
		<p>Cranly laughed, tightening  his grip on Stephen's arm, and
			said: </p>
		<p>—The distillery is damn good. </p>
		<p>—Is there anything else you want to know? Stephen asked. </p>
		<p>—Are you in good circumstances at present? </p>
		<p>—Do I look it? Stephen asked bluntly. </p>
		<p>—So then, Cranly went on musingly, you were born in the
			lap of luxury. </p>
		<p>He used the phrase broadly and loudly as he often used
			technical expressions as if he wished his hearer to understand
			that they were used by him without conviction. </p>
		<p>—Your mother must have gone through a good deal of
			suffering, he said then. Would you not try to save her from
			suffering more even if ... or would you? </p>
		<p>—If I could, Stephen said. That would cost me very little. </p>
		<p>—Then do so, Cranly said. Do as she wishes you to do.
			What is it for you? You disbelieve in it. It is a form: nothing
			else. And you will set her mind at rest. </p>
		<p>He ceased and, as Stephen did not reply, remained silent.
			Then, as if giving utterance to the process of his own thought,
			he said: </p>
		<p>—Whatever else is unsure in this stinking dunghill of a
			world a mother's love is not. Your mother brings you into the
			world, carries you first in her body. What do we know about
			what she feels? But whatever she feels, it, at least, must be
			real. It must be. What are our ideas or ambitions? Play. Ideas!
			Why, that bloody bleating goat Temple has ideas. MacCann
			has ideas too. Every jackass going the  roads thinks he has
			ideas. </p>
		<p>Stephen, who had been listening to the unspoken speech
			behind the words, said with  assumed carelessness: </p>
		<p>—Pascal, if I remember rightly, would not suffer his mother
			to kiss him as he feared the contact of her sex. </p>
		<p>—Pascal was a pig, said Cranly. </p>
		<p>—Aloysius Gonzaga, I think, was of the same mind, Stephen
			said. </p>
		<p>—And he was another pig then, said Cranly. </p>
		<p>—The church calls him a saint, Stephen objected. </p>
		<p>—I don't care a flaming damn what anyone calls him,
			Cranly said rudely and flatly. I call him a pig. </p>
		<p>Stephen, preparing the words neatly in his mind, continued: </p>
		<p>—Jesus, too, seems to have treated his mother with scant
			courtesy in public but Suarez, a jesuit theologian and Spanish
			gentleman, has apologised for him. </p>
		<p>—Did the idea ever occur to you, Cranly asked, that Jesus
			was not what he pretended to be? </p>
		<p>—The first person to whom that idea occurred,  Stephen
			answered, was Jesus himself. </p>
		<p>—I mean, Cranly said,  hardening in his speech, did the
			idea ever occur to you that he was himself a conscious hypocrite,
			what he called the jews of his time, a whited sepulchre?
			Or, to put it more plainly, that he was a blackguard? </p>
		<p>—That idea never occurred  to me, Stephen answered. But I
			am curious to know are you trying to make a convert of me or
			a pervert of yourself? </p>
		<p>He turned towards his friend's face and saw there a raw
			smile which some force of will strove to make finely
			significant. </p>
		<p>Cranly asked suddenly in a plain sensible tone: </p>
		<p>—Tell me the truth. Were you at all shocked by what I
			said? </p>
		<p>—Somewhat, Stephen said. </p>
		<p>—And why were you shocked, Cranly pressed on in the
			same tone, if you feel sure that our religion is false and that
			Jesus was not the son of God? </p>
		<p>—I am not at all sure of it, Stephen said. He is more like a
			son of God than a son of Mary. </p>
		<p>—And is that why you will not communicate, Cranly asked,
			because you are not sure of that too, because you feel that the
			host too may be the body and blood of the son of God and
			not a wafer of bread? And because you fear that it may be? </p>
		<p>—Yes, Stephen said quietly. I feel that and I also fear it. </p>
		<p>—I see, Cranly said. </p>
		<p>Stephen, struck by his tone of closure, reopened the discussion
			at once by saying: </p>
		<p>—I fear many things: dogs, horses, firearms, the sea,
			thunderstorms, machinery, the country roads at night. </p>
		<p>—But why do you fear a bit of bread? </p>
		<p>—I imagine, Stephen said, that there is a malevolent  reality
			behind those things I say I fear. </p>
		<p>—Do you fear then, Cranly asked, that the God of the
			Roman catholics would strike you dead and damn you if you
			made a sacrilegious communion? </p>
		<p>—The God of the Roman catholics could do that now,
			Stephen said. I fear more than that the chemical action which
			would be set up in my soul by a false homage to a symbol
			behind which are massed twenty centuries of authority and
			veneration. </p>
		<p>—Would you, Cranly asked, in extreme danger commit
			that particular sacrilege? For instance, if you lived in the penal
			days? </p>
		<p>—I cannot answer for the past, Stephen replied. Possibly
			not. </p>
		<p>—Then, said Cranly, you do not intend to become a protestant? </p>
		<p>—I said that I had lost the faith, Stephen answered, but not
			that I had lost selfrespect. What kind of liberation would that
			be to forsake an absurdity which is logical and coherent and to
			embrace one which is illogical and incoherent? </p>
		<p>They had walked on towards the township of Pembroke
			and now, as they went on slowly along the avenues, the trees
			and the scattered lights in the villas soothed their minds. The
			air of wealth and repose diffused about them seemed to comfort
			their neediness. Behind a hedge of laurel a light glimmered
			in the window of a kitchen and the voice of a servant
			was heard singing as she sharpened knives. She sang, in short
			broken bars, >. </p>
		<p>Cranly stopped to listen, saying: </p>
		<p>—<seg xml:lang="la">Mulier cantat.</seg> </p>
		<p>The soft beauty of the Latin word touched with an enchanting
			touch the  dark of the evening, with a touch fainter and
			more persuading than the touch of music or of a woman's
			hand. The strife of their minds was quelled. The figure of
			woman as she appears in the liturgy of the church passed
			silently through the darkness: a whiterobed figure, small and
			slender as a boy and with a falling girdle. Her voice, frail and
			high as a boy's, was heard intoning from a distant choir the
			first words of a woman which pierce the gloom and clamour of
			the first chanting of the passion: </p>
		<p>—<seg xml:lang="la">Et tu cum Jesu Galileao eras.</seg> </p>
		<p>And all  hearts were touched and turned to her voice, shining
			like a young star, shining clearer as the voice intoned the
			proparoxyton and more faintly as the cadence died. </p>
		<p>The singing ceased. They went on together, Cranly repeating
			in strongly stressed rhythm the end of the refrain: </p>
		<lg>
			<l>And when we are married, </l>
			<l>O, how happy we'll be </l>
			<l>For I love sweet Rosie O'Grady </l>
			<l>And Rosie O'Grady loves me. </l>
		</lg>
		<p>—There's  real poetry for you, he said. There's real love. </p>
		<p>He glanced sideways at Stephen with a strange smile and
			said: </p>
		<p>—Do you consider that poetry? Or do you know what the
			words mean? </p>
		<p>—I want to see Rosie first, said Stephen. </p>
		<p>—She's easy to find, Cranly said. </p>
		<p>His hat had come down on his forehead. He shoved it back:
			and in the shadow of the trees Stephen saw his pale face,
			framed by the dark, and his large dark eyes. Yes. His face was
			handsome: and his body was strong and hard. He had spoken
			of a mother's love. He felt then the sufferings of women, the
			weaknesses of their bodies and souls: and would shield them
			with a strong  and resolute arm and bow his mind to them. </p>
		<p>Away then: it is time to go. A voice spoke softly to Stephen's
			lonely heart, bidding him go and telling him that his
			friendship was coming to an end. Yes; he would go. He could
			not strive against another. He knew his part. </p>
		<p>—Probably I shall go away, he said. </p>
		<p>—Where? Cranly asked. </p>
		<p>—Where I can, Stephen said. </p>
		<p>—Yes, Cranly said. It might be difficult for you to live here
			now. But is it that that makes you go? </p>
		<p>—I have to go, Stephen answered. </p>
		<p>—Because, Cranly continued, you need not look upon
			yourself as driven away if you do not wish to go or as a heretic
			or an outlaw. There are many good believers who think as you
			do. Would that surprise you? The church is not the stone
			building nor even the clergy and their dogmas. It is the whole
			mass of those born into it. I don't know what you wish to do
			in life. Is it what you told me the night we were standing
			outside Harcourt Street station? </p>
		<p>—Yes, Stephen said, smiling in spite of himself at Cranly's
			way of remembering thoughts in connection with places. The
			night you spent half an hour wrangling with Doherty about the
			shortest way from Sallygap to Larras. </p>
		<p>—Pothead! Cranly said with calm contempt. What does he
			know about the way from Sallygap to Larras? Or what does
			he know about anything for that matter? And the big slobbering
			washingpot head of him! </p>
		<p>He broke out into a loud long laugh. </p>
		<p>—Well? Stephen said. Do you remember the rest? </p>
		<p>—What you said, is it? Cranly asked. Yes, I remember it.
			To discover the mode of life or of art whereby your spirit
			could express itself in unfettered freedom. </p>
		<p>Stephen raised his hat in acknowledgment. </p>
		<p>—Freedom! Cranly repeated. But you are not free enough
			yet to commit a sacrilege. Tell me, would you rob? </p>
		<p>—I would beg first, Stephen said. </p>
		<p>—And if you got  nothing, would you rob? </p>
		<p>—You wish me to say, Stephen answered, that the rights of
			property are provisional and that in certain circumstances it is
			not unlawful to rob. Everyone would act in that belief. So I
			will not make you that answer. Apply to the jesuit theologian
			Juan Mariana de Talavera who will also explain to you in
			what circumstances you may lawfully kill your king and
			whether you had better hand him his poison in a goblet or
			smear it for him upon his robe or his saddlebow. Ask me
			rather would I suffer others to rob me or, if they did, would I
			call down upon them what I believe is called the chastisement
			of the secular arm? </p>
		<p>—And would you? </p>
		<p>—I think, Stephen said, it would pain me as much to do so
			as to be robbed. </p>
		<p>—I see, Cranly said. </p>
		<p>He produced his match and began to clean the crevice
			between two teeth. Then he said carelessly: </p>
		<p>—Tell me, for example, would you deflower a virgin? </p>
		<p>—Excuse me, Stephen said politely, is that not the ambition
			of most young gentlemen? </p>
		<p>—What then is your point of view? Cranly asked. </p>
		<p>His last phrase, soursmelling as the smoke of charcoal and
			disheartening, excited Stephen's brain, over which its fumes
			seemed to brood. </p>
		<p>—Look here, Cranly, he said. You have asked me what I
			would do and what I would not do. I will tell you what I will do
			and what I will not do. I will not serve that in which I no
			longer believe whether it call itself my home, my fatherland or
			my church: and I will try to express myself in some mode of
			life or art as freely as I can and as wholly as I can, using for
			my defence the only arms I allow myself to use - silence, exile,
			and cunning. </p>
		<p>Cranly seized his arm and steered him round so as to head
			back towards Leeson Park. He laughed almost slily and pressed
			Stephen's arm with an elder's affection. </p>
		<p>—Cunning indeed! he said. Is it you? You poor poet, you! </p>
		<p>—And you made me confess to you, Stephen said, thrilled
			by his touch, as I have confessed to you so  many other things,
			have I not? </p>
		<p>—Yes, my child, Cranly said, still gaily. </p>
		<p>—You made me confess the fears that I have. But I will tell
			you also what I do not fear. I do not fear to be alone or to be
			spurned for another or to leave whatever I have to leave. And
			I am not afraid to make a mistake, even  a great  mistake, a
			lifelong mistake and perhaps as long as eternity too. </p>
		<p>Cranly, now grave again, slowed his pace and said: </p>
		<p>—Alone, quite alone. You have no fear of that. And you
			know what that word means? Not only to be separate from all
			others but to have not even one friend. </p>
		<p>—I will take the risk, said Stephen. </p>
		<p>—And not to have any one person, Cranly said, who would
			be more than a friend, more even than the noblest and truest
			friend a man ever had. </p>
		<p>His words seemed to have struck some deep chord in his
			own nature. Had he spoken of himself, of himself as he was or
			wished  to be? Stephen watched his face for some moments in
			silence. A cold sadness was there. He had spoken of himself,
			of his own loneliness which he feared. </p>
		<p>—Of whom are you speaking? Stephen asked at length. </p>
		<p>Cranly did not answer. </p>

		<p>20 > Long talk with Cranly on the subject of my

			Attacked me on the score of love for one's mother. Tried to

			thoughtlessness, his father was sixtyone when he was born.
			Can see him. Strong farmer type. Pepper and salt suit. Square
			feet. Unkempt grizzled beard. Probably attends coursing
			matches. Pays his dues regularly but not plentifully to Father
			Dwyer of Larras. Sometimes talks to girls after nightfall. But

			Cranly would not have spoken as he did. Old then. Probably,
			and neglected. Hence Cranly's despair of soul: the child of
			exhausted loins. </p>
		<p>21 > Thought this in bed last night but was
			too lazy and free to add it. Free, yes. The exhausted loins are

			Item: he eats chiefly belly bacon and dried figs. Read locusts
			and wild honey. Also, when thinking of him, saw always a
			stern severed head or deathmask as if outlined on a grey
			curtain or veronica. Decollation they call it in the fold. Puzzled
			for the moment by saint John at the Latin gate. What do I
			see? A decollated precursor trying to pick the lock. </p>

			greyhounds walking after a heifer. </p>
		<p>23 > Have not seen her since that night. Unwell? Sits
			at the fire perhaps with mamma's shawl on her shoulders. But
			not peevish. A nice bowl of gruel? Won't you now? </p>
		<p>24 > Began with a discussion with my mother. Subject:
			B. V. M. Handicapped by my sex and youth. To escape
			held up relations between Jesus and Papa against those between
			Mary and her son. Said religion was not a lying-in
			hospital. Mother indulgent. Said I have a queer mind and have
			read too much. Not true. Have read little and understood less.
			Then she said I would come back to faith because I had a
			restless mind. This means to leave church by backdoor of sin
			and reenter through the skylight of repentance. Cannot repent.
			Told her so and asked for sixpence. Got threepence. </p>
		<p>Then went to college. Other wrangle with little roundhead
			rogue'seye Ghezzi. This time about Bruno the Nolan. Began in
			Italian and ended in pidgin English. He said Bruno was a
			terrible heretic. I said he was terribly burned. He agreed to
			this with some sorrow. Then gave me recipe for what he calls
			<emph>risotto alla bergamasca</emph>. When he pronounces a soft <emph>o</emph> he
			protrudes his full carnal lips as if he kissed the vowel. Has he?
			And could he repent? Yes, he could: and cry two round

		<p>Crossing Stephen's, that is, my green, remembered that his

			peer at me and their eyes seem to ask me something. They do
			not speak. </p>
		<p>30 > This evening Cranly was in the porch of the
			library, proposing a problem to Dixon and her brother. A
			mother let her child fall into the Nile. Still harping on the
			mother. A crocodile seized the child. Mother asked it back.
			Crocodile said all right if she told him what he was going to do
			with the child, eat it or not eat it. </p>
		<p>This mentality, Lepidus would say, is indeed bred out of
			your mud by the operation of your sun. </p>
		<p>And mine? Is it not too? Then into Nilemud with it! </p>
		<p>1 > Disapprove of this last phrase. </p>
		<p>2 > Saw her drinking tea and eating cakes in Johnston,
			Mooney and O'Brien's. Rather, lynxeyed Lynch saw her
			as we passed. He tells me Cranly was invited there by brother.
			Did he bring his crocodile? Is he the shining light now? Well, I
			discovered him. I protest I did. Shining quietly behind a
			bushel of Wicklow bran. </p>
		<p>3 > Met Davin at the cigar shop opposite Findlater's
			church. He was in a black sweater and had a hurleystick.
			Asked me was it true I was going away and why. Told him the
			shortest way to Tara was > Holyhead. Just then my father
			came up. Introduction. Father, polite and observant. Asked
			Davin if he might offer him some refreshment. Davin could
			not, was going to a meeting. When we came away father told
			me he had a good honest eye. Asked me why I did not join a
			rowingclub. I pretended to think it over. Told me then how he
			broke Pennyfeather's heart. Wants me to read law. Says I was
			cut out for that. More mud, more crocodiles. </p>
		<p>5 > Wild spring. Scudding clouds. O life! Dark stream
			of swirling bogwater on which appletrees have cast down their
			delicate flowers. Eyes of girls among the leaves. Girls demure
			and romping. All fair or auburn: no dark ones. They blush
			better. Houp-la! </p>
		<p>6 > Certainly she remembers the past. Lynch says all
			women do. Then she remembers the time of her childhood -
			and mine if I was ever a child. The past is consumed in the
			present and the present is living only because it brings forth the
			future. Statues of women, if Lynch be right, should always be
			fully draped, one hand of the woman feeling regretfully her
			own hinder parts. </p>
		<p>6 > Michael Robartes remembers forgotten
			beauty and, when his arms wrap her round, he presses in his
			arms the loveliness which has long faded from the world. Not
			this. Not at all. I desire to press in my arms the loveliness
			which has not yet come into the world. </p>
		<p>10 > Faintly, under the heavy night, through  the silence
			of the city which has turned from dreams to dreamless sleep as
			a weary lover whom no caresses move, the sound of hoofs
			upon the road. Not so faintly now as they come near the
			bridge: and in a moment as they pass the darkened windows
			the silence is cloven by alarm as by an arrow. They are heard
			now far away, hoofs that shine amid the heavy  night as gems,
			hurrying beyond the sleeping fields to what journey's end -
			what heart? - bearing what tidings? </p>
		<p>11 > Read what I wrote last night. Vague words for a
			vague emotion. Would she like it? I think so. Then I should
			have to like it also. </p>
		<p>13 > That tundish has been on my mind for a long time.
			I looked it up and find it English and good old blunt English
			too. Damn the dean of studies and his funnel! What did he
			come here for to teach us his own language or to learn it from
			us? Damn him one way or the other! </p>
		<p>14 > John Alphonsus Mulrennan has just returned
			from the west of Ireland. (European and Asiatic papers
			please copy.) He told us he met an old man there in a mountain
			cabin. Old man had red eyes and short pipe. Old man
			spoke Irish. Mulrennan spoke Irish. Then old man and Mulrennan
			spoke English. Mulrennan spoke to him about universe
			and stars. Old man sat, listened, smoked, spat. Then said: </p>
		<p>—Ah, there must be terrible queer creatures at the latter
			end of the world. </p>
		<p>I fear him. I fear his redrimmed horny eyes. It is with him I
			must struggle all through this night till day come, till he or I lie
			dead, gripping him by the sinewy throat till ... Till what?
			Till he yield to me? No. I mean him no harm. </p>
		<p>15 > Met her today pointblank in Grafton Street. The
			crowd brought us together. We both stopped. She asked me
			why I never came, said she had heard all sorts of stories about
			me. This was only to gain time. Asked me, was I writing
			poems? About whom? I asked her. This confused her more
			and I felt sorry and mean. Turned off that valve at once
			and opened the spiritual-heroic refrigerating apparatus, invented
			and patented in all countries by Dante Alighieri.
			Talked rapidly of myself and my plans. In the midst of it
			unluckily I made a sudden gesture of a revolutionary nature. I
			must have looked like a fellow throwing a handful of peas into
			the air. People began to look at us.  She shook hands a moment
			after and, in going away, said she hoped I would do what
			I said. </p>
		<p>Now I call that friendly, don't you? </p>
		<p>Yes, I liked her today. A little or much? Don't know. I
			liked her and it seems a new feeling to me. Then, in that case,
			all the rest, all that I thought I thought and all that I felt I felt,
			all the rest before now, in fact ... O, give it up, old chap!
			Sleep it off! </p>
		<p>16 > Away! Away! </p>
		<p>The spell of arms and voices: the white arms of roads, their
			promise of close embraces and the black arms of tall ships that
			stand against the moon, their tale of distant nations. They are
			held out to say: We are alone. Come. And the voices say with
			them: We are your kinsmen.  And  the air is thick with their
			company as they call to me, their kinsman, making ready to
			go, shaking the wings of their exultant and terrible youth. </p>
		<p>26 > Mother is putting my new secondhand clothes in
			order. She prays now, she says, that I may learn in my own
			life and away from home and friends what the heart is and
			what it feels. Amen. So be it. Welcome, O life! I go to encounter
			for the millionth time the reality of experience and to forge
			in the smithy of my soul the uncreated conscience of my race. </p>
		<p>27 > Old father, old artificer, stand me now and ever
			in good stead. </p>
