		<p>Once upon a time and a very good time it was there was 
			a moocow coming down along the road and this moocow 
			that was coming down along the road met a nicens little 
			boy named baby tuckoo .... </p>
		<p>His father told him that story: his father looked at him 
			through a glass: he had a hairy face. </p>
		<p>He was baby tuckoo. The moocow came down the road 
			where Betty Byrne lived: she sold lemon platt. </p>

		<lg type="song">
			<l>O, the wild rose blossoms</l> 
			<l>On the little green place.</l>

		<p>He sang that song. That was his song. </p>

		<lg type="song">
			<l>O, the green wothe botheth.</l> 
		</lg>

		<p>When you wet the bed first it is warm then it gets cold. His 
			mother put on the oilsheet. That had the queer smell. </p>
		<p>His mother had a nicer smell than his father. She played on 
			the piano the sailor's hornpipe for him to dance. He danced: </p>

		<lg type="song">

			<l>Tralala tralaladdy</l> 
			<l>Tralala lala</l> 
			<l>Tralala lala.</l> 
		</lg>

		<p>Uncle Charles and Dante clapped. They were older than his 
			father and mother but uncle Charles was older than Dante. </p>
		<p>Dante had two brushes in her press. The brush with the 
			maroon velvet back was for Michael Davitt and the brush with 
			the green velvet back was for Parnell. Dante gave him a cachou 
			every time he brought her a piece of tissue paper. </p>
		<p>The Vances lived in number seven. They had a different 
			father and mother. They were Eileen's father and mother. 
			When they were grown up he was going to marry Eileen. He 
			hid under the table. His mother said: </p>
		<p><said who="Mary Dedalus">—O, Stephen will apologise. </said></p>
		<p>Dante said: </p>

	<div n="1.2" type="section"> 

		<p>The wide playgrounds were swarming with boys. All were 
			shouting and the prefects urged them on with strong cries. The 
			evening air was pale and chilly and after every charge and 
			thud of the footballers the greasy leather orb flew like a heavy 
			bird through the grey light. He kept on the fringe of his line, 
			out of sight of his prefect, out of the reach of the rude feet, 
			feigning to run now and then. He felt his body small and weak 
			amid the throng of players and his eyes were weak and watery. 
			Rody Kickham was not like that: he would be captain of the 
			third line all the fellows said. </p>
		<p>Rody Kickham was a decent fellow but Nasty Roche was a 
			stink. Rody Kickham had greaves in his number and a hamper 
			in the refectory. Nasty Roche had big hands. He called the 
			Friday pudding dog-in-the-blanket. And one day he had 
			asked: </p>
		<p><said who="Nasty Roche">—What is your name? </said></p>
		<p>Stephen had answered: </p>
		<p><said who="Stephen">—Stephen Dedalus. </said></p>
		<p>Then Nasty Roche had said: </p>
		<p><said who="Nasty Roche">—What kind of a name is that? </said></p>
		<p>And when Stephen had not been able to answer Nasty 
			Roche had asked: </p>
		<p><said who="Nasty Roche">—What is your father? </said></p>
		<p>Stephen had answered: </p>
		<p><said who="Stephen">—A gentleman. </said></p>
		<p>Then Nasty Roche had asked: </p>
		<p><said who="Nasty Roche">—Is he a magistrate? </said></p>
		<p>He crept about from point to point on the fringe of his line, 
			making little runs now and then. But his hands were bluish 
			with cold. He kept his hands in the sidepockets of his belted 
			grey suit. That was a belt round his pocket. And belt was also 
			to give a fellow a belt. One day a fellow had said to Cantwell: </p>
		<p><said who="a fellow">—I'd give you such a belt in a second. </said></p>
		<p>Cantwell had answered: </p>
		<p><said who="Cantwell">—Go and fight your match. Give Cecil Thunder a belt. I'd 
				like to see you. He'd give you a toe in the rump for yourself.</said></p>
		<p>That was not a nice expression. His mother had told him 
			not to speak with the rough boys in the college. Nice mother! 
			The first day in the hall of the castle when she had said goodbye 
			she had put up her veil double to her nose to kiss him: 
			and her nose and eyes were red. But he had pretended not to 
			see that she was going to cry. She was a nice mother but she 
			was not so nice when she cried. And his father had given him 
			two fiveshilling pieces for pocket money. And his father had 
			told him if he wanted anything to write home to him and, 
			whatever he did, never to peach on a fellow. Then at the door 
			of the castle the rector had shaken hands with his father and 
			mother, his soutane fluttering in the breeze, and the car had 
			driven off with his father and mother on it. They had cried to 
			him from the car, waving their hands: </p>

		<said who="Mary Dedalus, Simon Dedalus"> 
			<p>—Goodbye, Stephen, goodbye! </p>
			<p>—Goodbye, Stephen, goodbye! </p>
		</said>

		<p>He was caught in the whirl of a scrimmage and, fearful of 
			the flashing eyes and muddy boots, bent down to look through 
			the legs. The fellows were struggling and groaning and their 
			legs were rubbing and kicking and stamping. Then Jack Lawton's 
			yellow boots dodged out the ball and all the other boots 
			and legs ran after. He ran after them a little way and then 
			stopped. It was useless to run on. Soon they would be going 
			home for the holidays. After supper in the studyhall he would 
			change the number pasted up inside his desk from seventyseven 
			to seventysix. </p>
		<p>It would be better to be in the studyhall than out there in 
			the cold. The sky was pale and cold but there were lights in 
			the castle. He wondered from which window Hamilton Rowan 
			had thrown his hat on the haha and had there been flowerbeds 
			at that time under the windows. One day when he had been 
			called to the castle the butler had shown him the marks of the 
			soldiers' slugs in the wood of the door and had given him a 
			piece of shortbread that the community ate. It was nice and 
			warm to see the lights in the castle. It was like something in a 
			book. Perhaps Leicester Abbey was like that. And there were 
			nice sentences in Doctor Cornwell's Spelling Book. They were 
			like poetry but they were only sentences to learn the spelling 
			from. </p>

		<lg>
			<l>Wolsey died in Leicester Abbey</l> 
			<l>Where the abbots buried him.</l> 
			<l>Canker is a disease of plants,</l> 
			<l>Cancer one of animals.</l> 
		</lg>

		<p>It would be nice to lie on the hearthrug before the fire, 
			leaning his head upon his hands, and think on those sentences. 
			He shivered as if he had cold slimy water next his skin. That 
			was mean of Wells to shoulder him into the square ditch 
			because he would not swop his little snuffbox for Wells's 
			seasoned hacking chestnut, the conqueror of forty. How cold 
			and slimy the water had been! A fellow had once seen a big rat 
			jump into the scum. Mother was sitting at the fire with Dante 
			waiting for Brigid to bring in the tea. She had her feet on the 
			fender and her jewelly slippers were so hot and they had such 
			a lovely warm smell! Dante knew a lot of things. She had 
			taught him where the Mozambique Channel was and what was 
			the longest river in America and what was the name of the 
			highest mountain in the moon. Father Arnall knew more than 
			Dante because he was a priest but both his father and uncle 
			Charles said that Dante was a clever woman and a wellread 
			woman. And when Dante made that noise after dinner and 
			then put up her hand to her mouth: that was heartburn. </p>
		<p>A voice cried far out on the playground: </p>

		<said who="a voice">
			<p>—All in! </p>
		</said>

		<p>Then other voices cried from the lower and third lines: </p>

		<said who="other voices from the lower and third lines">
			<p>—All in! All in! </p>
		</said>

		<p>The players closed around, flushed and muddy, and he went 
			among them, glad to go in. Rody Kickham held the ball by its 
			greasy lace. A fellow asked him to give it one last: but he 
			walked on without even answering the fellow. Simon Moonan 
			told him not to because the prefect was looking. The fellow 
			turned to Simon Moonan and said: </p>
		<p><said who="a fellow">—We all know why you speak. You are McGlade's suck.</said></p>
		<p>Suck was a queer word. The fellow called Simon Moonan 
			that name because Simon Moonan used to tie the prefect's 
			false sleeves behind his back and the prefect used to let on to 
			be angry. But the sound was ugly. Once he had washed his 
			hands in the lavatory of the Wicklow Hotel and his father 
			pulled the stopper up by the chain after and the dirty water 
			went down through the hole in the basin. And when it had all 
			gone down slowly the hole in the basin had made a sound like 
			that: suck. Only louder. </p>
		<p>To remember that and the white look of the lavatory made 
			him feel cold and then hot. There were two cocks that you 
			turned and water came out: cold and hot. He felt cold and 
			then a little hot: and he could see the names printed on the 
			cocks. That was a very queer thing. </p>
		<p>And the air in the corridor chilled him too. It was queer and 
			wettish. But soon the gas would be lit and in burning it made a 
			light noise like a little song. Always the same: and when the 
			fellows stopped talking in the playroom you could hear it. </p>
		<p>It was the hour for sums. Father Arnall wrote a hard sum 
			on the board and then said: </p>
		<p><said who="Father Arnall">—Now then, who will win? Go ahead, York! Go ahead, 
				Lancaster!</said></p>
		<p>Stephen tried his best but the sum was too hard and he felt 
			confused. The little silk badge with the white rose on it that 
			was pinned on the breast of his jacket began to flutter. He was 
			no good at sums but he tried his best so that York might not 
			lose. Father Arnall's face looked very black but he was not in 
			a wax: he was laughing. Then Jack Lawton cracked his fingers 
			and Father Arnall looked at his copybook and said: </p>
		<p><said who="Father Arnall">—Right. Bravo Lancaster! The red rose wins. Come on 
				now, York! Forge ahead!</said></p>
		<p>Jack Lawton looked over from his side. The little silk badge 
			with the red rose on it looked very rich because he had a blue 
			sailor top on.  Stephen felt his own face red too, thinking of all 
			the bets about who would get first place in elements, Jack 
			Lawton or he. Some weeks Jack Lawton got the card for first 
			and some weeks he got the card for first. His white silk badge 
			fluttered and fluttered as he worked at the next sum and heard 
			Father Arnall's voice. Then all his eagerness passed away and 
			he felt his face quite cool. He thought his face must be white 
			because it felt so cool. He could not get out the answer for the 
			sum but it did not matter. White roses and red roses: those 
			were beautiful colours to think of. And the cards for first place 
			and second place and third place were beautiful colours too: 
			pink and cream and lavender. Lavender and cream and pink 
			roses were beautiful to think of. Perhaps a wild rose might be 
			like those colours and he remembered the song about the wild 
			rose blossoms on the little green place. But you could not have 
			a green rose. But perhaps somewhere in the world you could. </p>
		<p>The bell rang and then the classes began to file out of the 
			rooms and along the corridors towards the refectory. He sat 
			looking at the two prints of butter on his plate but could not 
			eat the damp bread. The tablecloth was damp and limp. But 
			he drank off the hot weak tea which the clumsy scullion, girt 
			with a white apron, poured into his cup. He wondered 
			whether the scullion's apron was damp too or whether all 
			white things were cold and damp. Nasty Roche and Saurin 
			drank cocoa that their people sent them in tins. They said they 
			could not drink the tea; that it was hogwash. Their fathers 
			were magistrates, the fellows said. </p>
		<p>All the boys seemed to him very strange. They had all 
			fathers and mothers and different clothes and voices. He 
			longed to be at home and lay his head on his mother's lap. But 
			he could not: and so he longed for the play and study and 
			prayers to be over and to be in bed. </p>
		<p>He drank another cup of hot tea and Fleming said: </p>
		<p><said who="Fleming">—What's up? Have you a pain or what's up with you? </said></p>
		<p><said who="Stephen">—I don't know, Stephen said. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Fleming">—Sick in your breadbasket, Fleming said, because your 
				face looks white. It will go away. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Stephen">—O yes, Stephen said. </said></p>
		<p>But he was not sick there. He thought that he was sick in 
			his heart if you could be sick in that place. Fleming was very 
			decent to ask him. He wanted to cry. He leaned his elbows on 
			the table and shut and opened the flaps of his ears. Then he 
			heard the noise of the refectory every time he opened the flaps 
			of his ears. It made a roar like a train at night. And when he 
			closed the flaps the roar was shut off like a train going into a 
			tunnel. That night at Dalkey the train had roared like that and 
			then, when it went into the tunnel, the roar stopped. He closed 
			his eyes and the train went on, roaring  and then stopping; 
			roaring again, stopping. It was nice to hear it roar and stop 
			and then roar out of the tunnel again and then stop. </p>
		<p>Then the higher line fellows began to come down along the 
			matting in the middle of the refectory, Paddy Rath and Jimmy 
			Magee and the Spaniard who was allowed to smoke cigars and 
			the little Portuguese who wore the woolly cap. And then the 
			lower line tables and the tables of the third line. And every 
			single fellow had a different way of walking. </p>
		<p>He sat in a corner of the playroom pretending to watch a 
			game of dominos and once or twice he was able to hear for an 
			instant the little song of the gas. The prefect was at the door 
			with some boys and Simon Moonan was knotting his false 
			sleeves. He was telling them something about Tullabeg. </p>
		<p>Then he went away from the door and Wells came over to 
			Stephen and said: </p>
		<p><said who="Wells">—Tell us, Dedalus, do you kiss your mother before you go 
				to bed? </said></p>
		<p>Stephen answered: </p>
		<p><said who="Stephen">—I do. </said></p>
		<p>Wells turned to the other fellows and said: </p>
		<p><said who="Wells">—O, I say, here's a fellow says he kisses his mother every 
				night before he goes to bed. </said></p>
		<p>The other fellows stopped their game and turned round, 
			laughing. Stephen blushed under their eyes and said: </p>
		<p><said who="Stephen">—I do not. </said></p>
		<p>Wells said: </p>
		<p><said who="Wells">—O, I say, here's a fellow says he doesn't kiss his mother 
				before he goes to bed. </said></p>
		<p>They all laughed again. Stephen tried to laugh with them. 
			He felt his whole body hot and confused in a moment. What 
			was the right answer to the question? He had given two and 
			still Wells laughed. But Wells must know the right answer for 
			he was in third of grammar. He tried to think of Wells's 
			mother but he did not dare to raise his eyes to Wells's face. He 
			did not like Wells's face. It was Wells who had shouldered him 
			into the square ditch the day before because he would not 
			swop his little snuffbox for Wells's seasoned hacking chestnut, 
			the conqueror of forty. It was a mean thing to do; all the 
			fellows said it was. And how cold and slimy the water had 
			been! And a fellow had once seen a big rat jump plop into the 
			scum. </p>
		<p>The cold slime of the ditch covered his whole body; and, 
			when the bell rang for study and the lines filed out of the 
			playrooms, he felt the cold air of the corridor and staircase 
			inside his clothes. He still tried to think what was the right 
			answer. Was it right to kiss his mother or wrong to kiss his 
			mother? What did that mean, to kiss? You put your face up 
			like that to say goodnight and then his mother put her face 
			down. That was to kiss. His mother put her lips on his cheek; 
			her lips were soft and they wetted his cheek; and they made a 
			tiny little noise: kiss. Why did people do that with their two 
			faces? </p>
		<p>Sitting in the studyhall he opened the lid of his desk and 
			changed the number pasted up inside from seventyseven to 
			seventysix. But the Christmas vacation was very far away: but 
			one time it would come because the earth moved round always. </p>
		<p>There was a picture of the earth on the first page of his 
			geography: a big ball in the middle of clouds. Fleming had a 
			box of crayons and one night during free study he had coloured 
			the earth green and the clouds maroon. That was like 
			the two brushes in Dante's press, the brush with the green 
			velvet back for Parnell and the brush with the maroon velvet 
			back for Michael Davitt. But he had not told Fleming to 
			colour them those colours. Fleming had done it himself. </p>
		<p>He opened the geography to study the lesson; but he could 
			not learn the names of places in America. Still they were all 
			different places that had those different names. They were all 
			in different countries and the countries were in continents and 
			the continents were in the world and the world was in the 
			universe. </p>
		<p>He turned to the flyleaf of the geography and read what he 
			had written there: himself, his name and where he was. </p>

		<lg>
			<l>Stephen Dedalus</l> 
			<l>Class of Elements</l> 
			<l>Clongowes Wood College</l> 
			<l>Sallins</l> 
			<l>County Kildare</l> 
			<l>Ireland</l> 
			<l>Europe</l> 
			<l>The World</l> 
			<l>The Universe</l> 
		</lg>

		<p>That was in his writing: and Fleming one night for a cod 
			had written on the opposite page: </p>
		<lg>
			<l>Stephen Dedalus is my name,</l> 
			<l>Ireland is my nation.</l> 
			<l>Clongowes is my dwellingplace</l> 
			<l>And heaven my expectation.</l> 
		</lg>

		<p>He read the verses backwards but then they were not poetry. 
			Then he read the flyleaf from the bottom to the top till he 
			came to his own name. That was he: and he read down the 
			page again. What was after the universe? Nothing. But was 
			there anything round the universe to show where it stopped 
			before the nothing place began? It could not be a wall but 
			there could be a thin thin line there all round everything. It 
			was very big to think about everything and everywhere. Only 
			God could do that. He tried to think what a big thought that 
			must be but he could think only of God. God was God's name 
			just as his name was Stephen. <hi rend="italic">Dieu</hi> was the French for God 
			and that was God's name too; and when anyone prayed to 
			God and said <hi rend="italic">Dieu</hi> then God knew at once that it was a 
			French person that was praying. But though there were 
			different names for God in all the different languages in the 
			world and God understood what all the people who prayed 
			said in their different languages still God remained always the 
			same God and God's real name was God. </p>
		<p>It made him very tired to think that way. It made him feel 
			his head very big. He turned over the flyleaf and looked 
			wearily at the green round earth in the middle of the maroon 
			clouds. He wondered which was right, to be for the green or 
			for the maroon, because Dante had ripped the green velvet 
			back off the brush that was for Parnell one day with her scissors 
			and had told him that Parnell was a bad man. He wondered 
			if they were arguing at home about that. That was called 
			politics. There were two sides in it: Dante was on one side and 
			his father and Mr Casey were on the other side but his mother 
			and uncle Charles were on no side. Every day there was 
			something in the paper about it. </p>
		<p>It pained him that he did not know well what politics meant 
			and that he did not know where the universe ended. He felt 
			small and weak. When would he be like the fellows in poetry 
			and rhetoric? They had big voices and big boots and they 
			studied trigonometry. That was very far away. First came the 
			vacation and then the next term and then vacation again and 
			then again another term and then again the vacation. It was 
			like a train going in and out of tunnels and that was like the 
			noise of the boys eating in the refectory when you opened and 
			closed the flaps of the ears. Term, vacation; tunnel, out; noise, 
			stop. How far away it was! It was better to go to bed to sleep. 
			Only prayers in the chapel and then bed. He shivered and 
			yawned. It would be lovely in bed after the sheets got a bit 
			hot. First they were so cold to get into. He shivered to think 
			how cold they were first. But then they got hot and then he 
			could sleep. It was lovely to be tired. He yawned again. Night 
			prayers and then bed: he shivered and wanted to yawn. It 
			would be lovely in a few minutes. He felt a warm glow creeping 
			up from the cold shivering sheets, warmer and warmer till 
			he felt warm all over, ever so warm; ever so warm and yet he 
			shivered a little and still wanted to yawn. </p>
		<p>The bell rang for night prayers and he filed out of the studyhall 
			after the others and down the staircase and along the 
			corridors to the chapel. The corridors were darkly lit and the 
			chapel was darkly lit. Soon all would be dark and sleeping. 
			There was cold night air in the chapel and the marbles were 
			the colour the sea was at night. The sea was cold day and 
			night: but it was colder at night. It was cold and dark under 
			the seawall beside his father's house. But the kettle would be 
			on the hob to make punch. </p>
		<p>The prefect of the chapel prayed above his head and his 
			memory knew the responses: </p>

		<seg type="prayer">
			<lg>
				<l>O Lord, open our lips</l> 
				<l>And our mouth shall announce Thy praise.</l> 
				<l>Incline unto our aid, O God!</l> 
				<l>O Lord, make haste to help us!</l> 
			</lg>
		</seg>

		<p>There was a cold night smell in the chapel. But it was a holy 
			smell. It was not like the smell of the old peasants who knelt at 
			the back of the chapel at Sunday mass. That was a smell of air 
			and rain and turf and corduroy. But they were very holy 
			peasants. They breathed behind him on his neck and sighed as 
			they prayed. They lived in Clane, a fellow said: there were 
			little cottages there and he had seen a woman standing at the 
			halfdoor of a cottage with a child in her arms, as the cars had 
			come past from Sallins. It would be lovely to sleep for one 
			night in that cottage before the fire of smoking turf, in the 
			dark lit by the fire, in the warm dark, breathing the smell of 
			the peasants, air and rain and turf and corduroy. But, O, the 
			road there between the trees was dark! You would be lost in 
			the dark. It made him afraid to think of how it was. </p>
		<p>He heard the voice of the prefect of the chapel saying the 
			last prayer. He prayed it too against the dark outside under 
			the trees. </p>

		<seg type="prayer">
			Visit, we beseech Thee, O Lord, this habitation and
			drive away from it all the snares of the enemy. May Thy
			holy angels dwell herein to preserve us in peace and
			may Thy blessing be always upon us through Christ, Our
			Lord. Amen. 
		</seg>

		<p>His fingers trembled as he undressed himself in the dormitory. 
			He told his fingers to hurry up. He had to undress and 
			then kneel and say his own prayers and be in bed before the 
			gas was lowered so that he might not go to hell when he died. 
			He rolled his stockings off and put on his nightshirt quickly 
			and knelt trembling at his bedside and repeated his prayers 
			quickly quickly, fearing that the gas would go down. He felt 
			his shoulders shaking as he murmured: </p>

		<seg type="prayer">
			<lg>
				<l>God bless my father and my mother and spare them to me!</l> 
				<l>God bless my little brothers and sisters and spare them to me!</l> 
				<l>God bless Dante and uncle Charles and spare them to me!</l> 
			</lg>
		</seg> 

		<p>He blessed himself and climbed quickly into bed and, 
			tucking the end of the nightshirt under his feet, curled himself 
			together under the cold white sheets, shaking and trembling. 
			But he would not go to hell when he died; and the shaking 
			would stop. A voice bade the boys in the dormitory goodnight. 
			He peered out for an instant over the coverlet and saw the 
			yellow curtains round and before his bed that shut him off on 
			all sides. The light was lowered quietly. </p>
		<p>The prefect's shoes went away. Where? Down the staircase 
			and along the corridors or to his room at the end? He saw the 
			dark. Was it true about the black dog that walked there at 
			night with eyes as big as carriagelamps? They said it was the 
			ghost of a murderer. A long shiver of fear flowed over his 
			body. He saw the dark entrance hall of the castle. Old servants 
			in old dress were in the ironingroom above the staircase. It 
			was long ago. The old servants were quiet. There was a fire 
			there but the hall was still dark. A figure came up the staircase 
			from the hall. He wore the white cloak of a marshal; his face 
			was pale and strange; he held his hand pressed to his side. He 
			looked out of strange eyes at the old servants. They looked at 
			him and saw their master's face and cloak and knew that he 
			had received his deathwound. But only the dark was where 
			they looked: only dark silent air. Their master had received 
			his deathwound on the battlefield of Prague far away over the 
			sea. He was standing on the field; his hand was pressed to his 
			side; his face was pale and strange and he wore the white 
			cloak of a marshal. </p>
		<p>O how cold and strange it was to think of that! All the dark 
			was cold and strange. There were pale strange faces there, 
			great eyes like carriagelamps. They were the ghosts of murderers, 
			the figures of marshals who had received their deathwound 
			on battlefields far away over the sea. What did they 
			wish to say that their faces were so strange? </p>

		<seg type="prayer">
			Visit, we beseech Thee, O Lord, this habitation and drive 
			away from it all ... 
		</seg>

		<p>Going home for the holidays! That would be lovely: the 
			fellows had told him. Getting up on the cars in the early wintry 
			morning outside the door of the castle. The cars were 
			rolling on  the gravel. Cheers for the rector! </p>
		<p>Hurray! Hurray! Hurray! </p>
		<p>The cars drove past the chapel and all caps were raised. 
			They drove merrily along the country roads. The drivers 
			pointed with their whips to Bodenstown. The fellows cheered. 
			They passed the farmhouse of the Jolly Farmer. Cheer after 
			cheer after cheer. Through Clane they drove, cheering and 
			cheered. The peasant women stood at the halfdoors, the men 
			stood here and there. The lovely smell there was in the wintry 
			air: the smell of Clane: rain and wintry air and turf smouldering 
			and corduroy. </p>
		<p>The train was full of fellows: a long long chocolate train 
			with cream facings. The guards went to and fro opening, 
			closing, locking, unlocking the doors. They were men in dark 
			blue and silver; they had silvery whistles and their keys made 
			a quick music: click, click: click, click. </p>
		<p>And the train raced on over the flat lands and past the Hill 
			of Allen. The telegraphpoles were passing, passing. The train 
			went on and on. It knew. There were coloured lanterns in the 
			hall of his father's house and ropes of green branches. There 
			were holly and ivy round the pierglass and holly and ivy, green 
			and red, twined round the chandeliers. There were red holly 
			and green ivy round the old portraits on the walls. Holly and 
			ivy for him and for Christmas. </p>
		<p>Lovely ... </p>
		<p>All the people. Welcome home, Stephen! Noises of welcome. 
			His mother kissed him. Was that right? His father was a 
			marshal now: higher than a magistrate. Welcome home, 
			Stephen! </p>
		<p>Noises ... </p>
		<p>There was a noise of curtainrings running back along the 
			rods, of water being splashed in the basins. There was a noise 
			of rising and dressing and washing in the dormitory: a noise of 
			clapping of hands as the prefect went up and down telling the 
			fellows to look sharp. A pale sunlight showed the yellow 
			curtains drawn back, the tossed beds. His bed was very hot 
			and his face and body were very hot. </p>
		<p>He got up and sat on the side of his bed. He was weak. He 
			tried to pull on his stocking. It had a horrid rough feel. The 
			sunlight was queer and cold. </p>
		<p>Fleming said: </p>
		<p><said who="Fleming">—Are you not well? </said></p>
		<p>He did not know; and Fleming said: </p>
		<p><said who="Fleming">—Get back into bed. I'll tell McGlade you're not well. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Fleming">—He's sick. </said></p>
		<p><said who="">—Who is? </said></p>
		<p><said who="Fleming">—Tell McGlade. </said></p>
		<p><said who="">—Get back into bed. </said></p>
		<p><said who="">—Is he sick? </said></p>
		<p>A fellow held his arms while he loosened the stocking 
			clinging to his foot and climbed back into the hot bed. </p>
		<p>He crouched down between the sheets, glad of their tepid 
			glow. He heard the fellows talk among themselves about him 
			as they dressed for mass. It was a mean thing to do, to shoulder 
			him into the square ditch, they were saying. </p>
		<p>Then their voices ceased; they had gone. A voice at his bed 
			said: </p>
		<p><said who="Wells">—Dedalus, don't spy on us, sure you won't? </said></p>
		<p>Wells's face was there. He looked at it and saw that Wells 
			was afraid. </p>
		<p><said who="Wells">—I didn't mean to. Sure you won't? </said></p>
		<p>His father had told him, whatever he did, never to peach on 
			a fellow. He shook his head and answered no and felt glad. 
			Wells said: </p>
		<p><said who="Wells">—I didn't mean to, honour bright. It was only for cod. I'm 
				sorry. </said></p>
		<p>The face and the voice went away. Sorry because he was 
			afraid. Afraid that it was some disease. Canker was a disease 
			of plants and cancer one of animals: or another different. That 
			was a long time ago then out on the playgrounds in the evening 
			light, creeping from point to point on the fringe of his 
			line, a heavy bird flying low through the grey light. Leicester 
			Abbey lit up. Wolsey died there. The abbots buried him 
			themselves. </p>
		<p>It was not Wells's face, it was the prefect's. He was not 
			foxing. No, no: he was sick really. He was not foxing. And he 
			felt the prefect's hand on his forehead; and he felt his forehead 
			warm and damp against the prefect's cold damp hand. That 
			was the way a rat felt, slimy and damp and cold. Every rat had 
			two eyes to look out of. Sleek slimy coats, little little feet 
			tucked up to jump, black shiny eyes to look out of. They could 
			understand how to jump. But the minds of rats could not 
			understand trigonometry. When they were dead they lay on 
			their sides. Their coats dried then. They were only dead 
			things. </p>
		<p>The prefect was there again and it was his voice that was 
			saying that he was to get up, that Father Minister had said he 
			was to get up and dress and go to the infirmary. And while he 
			was dressing himself as quickly as he could the prefect said: </p>
		<p><said who="the prefect">—We must pack off to Brother Michael because we have 
			the collywobbles! Terrible thing to have the collywobbles! 
			How we wobble when we have the collywobbles! </said></p>
		<p>He was very decent to say that. That was all to make him 
			laugh. But he could not laugh because his cheeks and lips 
			were all shivery: and then the prefect had to laugh by himself. </p>
		<p>The prefect cried: </p>
		<p><said who="the prefect">—Quick march! Hayfoot! Strawfoot! </said></p>
		<p>They went together down the staircase and along the corridor 
			and past the bath. As he passed the door he remembered 
			with a vague fear the warm turfcoloured bogwater, the warm 
			moist air, the noise of plunges, the smell of the towels, like 
			medicine. </p>
		<p>Brother Michael was standing at the door of the infirmary 
			and from the door of the dark cabinet on his right came a 
			smell like medicine. That came from the bottles on the 
			shelves. The prefect spoke to Brother Michael and Brother 
			Michael answered and called the prefect sir. He had reddish 
			hair mixed with grey and a queer look. It was queer that he 
			would always be a brother. It was queer too that you could 
			not call him sir because he was a brother and had a different 
			kind of look. Was he not holy enough or why could he not 
			catch up on the others? </p>
		<p>There were two beds in the room and in one bed there was 
			a fellow: and when they went in he called out: </p>
		<p><said who="Athy">—Hello! It's young Dedalus! What's up? </said></p>
		<p><said who="Brother Michael">—The sky is up, Brother Michael said. </said></p>
		<p>He was a fellow out of the third of grammar and, while 
			Stephen was undressing, he asked Brother Michael to bring 
			him a round of buttered toast. </p>
		<p><said who="Athy">—Ah, do! he said. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Brother Michael">—Butter you up! said Brother Michael. You'll get your 
				walking papers in the morning when the doctor comes. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Athy">—Will I? the fellow said. I'm not well yet. </said></p>
		<p>Brother Michael repeated: </p>
		<p><said who="Athy">—You'll get your walking papers, I tell you. </said></p>
		<p>He bent down to rake the fire. He had a long back like the 
			long back of a tramhorse. He shook the poker gravely and 
			nodded his head at the fellow out of third of grammar. </p>
		<p>Then Brother Michael went away and after a while the 
			fellow out of third of grammar turned in towards the wall and 
			fell asleep. </p>
		<p>That was the infirmary. He was sick then. Had they written 
			home to tell his mother and father? But it would be quicker 
			for one of the priests to go himself to tell them. Or he would 
			write a letter for the priest to bring. </p>

		<seg type="letter">
			<lg>
				<l>Dear Mother</l> 
				<l>I am sick. I want to go home. Please come and take me</l> 
				home. I am in the infirmary. 
				<l>Your fond son,</l> 
				<l>Stephen</l> 
			</lg>
		</seg> 

		<p>How far away they were! There was cold sunlight outside 
			the window. He wondered if he would die. You could die just 
			the same on a sunny day. He might die before his mother 
			came. Then he would have a dead mass in the chapel like the 
			way the fellows had told him it was when Little had died. All 
			the fellows would be at the mass, dressed in black, all with sad 
			faces. Wells too would be there but no fellow would look at 
			him. The rector would be there in a cope of black and gold 
			and there would be tall yellow candles on the altar and round 
			the catafalque. And they would carry the coffin out of the 
			chapel slowly and he would be buried in the little graveyard of 
			the community off the main avenue of limes. And Wells would 
			be sorry then for what he had done. And the bell would toll 
			slowly. </p>
		<p>He could hear the tolling. He said over to himself the song 
			that Brigid had taught him. </p>

		<lg type="song">
			<l>Dingdong! The castle bell!</l> 
			<l>Farewell, my mother!</l> 
			<l>Bury me in the old churchyard</l> 
			<l>Beside my eldest brother.</l> 
			<l>My coffin shall be black,</l> 
			<l>Six angels at my back,</l> 
			<l>Two to sing and two to pray</l> 
			<l>And two to carry my soul away.</l> 
		</lg>

		<p>How beautiful and sad that was! How beautiful the words 
			were where they said <hi rend="italic">Bury me in the old churchyard</hi>! A 
			tremor passed over his body. How sad and how beautiful! He 
			wanted to cry quietly but not for himself: for the words, so 
			beautiful and sad, like music. The bell! The bell! Farewell! O 
			farewell! </p>
		<p>The cold sunlight was weaker and Brother Michael was 
			standing at his bedside with a bowl of beeftea. He was glad for 
			his mouth was hot and dry. He could hear them playing on the 
			playgrounds. And the day was going on in the college just as if 
			he were there. </p>
		<p>Then Brother Michael was going away and the fellow out of 
			third of grammar told him to be sure and come back and tell 
			him all the news in the paper. He told Stephen that his name 
			was Athy and that his father kept a lot of racehorses that were 
			spiffing jumpers and that his father would give a good tip to 
			Brother Michael any time he wanted it because Brother Michael 
			was very decent and always told him the news out of the 
			paper they got every day up in the castle. There was every 
			kind of news in the paper: accidents, shipwrecks, sports and 
			politics. </p>
		<p><said who="Athy">—Now it is all about politics in the paper, he said. Do your 
				people talk about that too? </said></p>
		<p><said who="Stephen">—Yes, Stephen said. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Athy">—Mine too, he said. </said></p>
		<p>Then he thought for a moment and said: </p>
		<p><said who="Athy">—You have a queer name, Dedalus, and I have a queer 
			name too, Athy. My name is the name of a town. Your name 
			is like Latin. </said></p>
		<p>Then he asked: </p>
		<p><said who="Athy">—Are you good at riddles? </said></p>
		<p>Stephen answered: </p>
		<p><said who="Stephen">—Not very good. </said></p>
		<p>Then he said: </p>
		<p><said who="Athy">—Can you answer me this one? Why is the county Kildare 
				like the leg of a fellow's breeches? </said></p>
		<p>Stephen thought what could be the answer and then said: </p>
		<p><said who="Stephen">—I give it up. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Athy">—Because there is a thigh in it, he said. Do you see the 
			joke? Athy is the town in the county Kildare and a thigh is the 
			other thigh. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Stephen">—O, I see, Stephen said. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Athy">—That's an old riddle, he said. </said></p>
		<p>After a moment he said: </p>
		<p><said who="Athy">—I say! </said></p>
		<p><said who="Stephen">—What? asked Stephen. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Athy">—You know, he said, you can ask that riddle another way? </said></p>
		<p><said who="Stephen">—Can you? said Stephen. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Athy">—The same riddle, he said. Do you know the other way to 
				ask it? </said></p>
		<p><said who="Stephen">—No, said Stephen. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Athy">—Can you not think of the other way? he said. </said></p>
		<p>He looked at Stephen over the bedclothes as he spoke. 
			Then he lay back on the pillow and said: </p>
		<p><said who="Athy">—There is another way but I won't tell you what it is. </said></p>
		<p>Why did he not tell it? His father, who kept the racehorses, 
			must be a magistrate too like Saurin's father and Nasty 
			Roche's father. He thought of his own father, of how he sang 
			songs while his mother played and of how he always gave him 
			a shilling when he asked for sixpence and he felt sorry for him 
			that he was not a magistrate like the other boys' fathers. Then 
			why was he sent to that place with them? But his father had 
			told him that he would be no stranger there because his granduncle 
			had presented an address to the liberator there fifty 
			years before. You could know the people of that time by their 
			old dress. It seemed to him a solemn time: and he wondered if 
			that was the time when the fellows in Clongowes wore blue 
			coats with brass buttons and yellow waistcoats and caps of 
			rabbitskin and drank beer like grownup people and kept 
			greyhounds of their own to course the hares with. </p>
		<p>He looked at the window and saw that the daylight had 
			grown weaker. There would be cloudy grey light over the 
			playgrounds. There was no noise on the playgrounds. The 
			class must be doing the themes or perhaps Father Arnall was 
			reading a legend out of the book. </p>
		<p>It was queer that they had not given him any medicine. 
			Perhaps Brother Michael would bring it back when he came. 
			They said you got stinking stuff to drink when you were in the 
			infirmary. But he felt better now than before. It would be nice 
			getting better slowly. You could get a book then. There was a 
			book in the library about Holland. There were lovely foreign 
			names in it and pictures of strangelooking cities and ships. It 
			made you feel so happy. </p>
		<p>How pale the light was at the window! But that was nice. 
			The fire rose and fell on the wall. It was like waves. Someone 
			had put coal on and he heard voices. They were talking. It was 
			the noise of the waves. Or the waves were talking among 
			themselves as they rose and fell. </p>
		<p>He saw the sea of waves, long dark waves rising and falling, 
			dark under the moonless night. A tiny light twinkled at the 
			pierhead where the ship was entering: and he saw a multitude 
			of people gathered by the waters' edge to see the ship that 
			was entering their harbour. A tall man stood on the deck, 
			looking out towards the flat dark land: and by the light at 
			the pierhead he saw his face, the sorrowful face of Brother 
			Michael. </p>
		<p>He saw him lift his hand towards the people and heard him 
			say in a loud voice of sorrow over the waters: </p>
		<p><said who="Brother Michael">—He is dead. We saw him lying upon the catafalque. </said></p>
		<p>A wail of sorrow went up from the people. </p>
		<p><said who="the people">—Parnell! Parnell! He is dead! </said></p>
		<p>They fell upon their knees, moaning in sorrow. </p>
		<p>And he saw Dante in a maroon velvet dress and with a 
			green velvet mantle hanging from her shoulders walking 
			proudly and silently past the people who knelt by the waters' 
			edge. </p>

	<div n="1.3" type="section"> 

		<p>A great fire, banked high and red, flamed in the grate and 
			under the ivytwined branches of the chandelier the Christmas 
			table was spread. They had come home a little late and still 
			dinner was not ready: but it would be ready in a jiffy, his 
			mother had said. They were waiting for the door to open and 
			for the servants to come in, holding the big dishes covered 
			with their heavy metal covers. </p>
		<p>All were waiting: uncle Charles, who sat far away in the 
			shadow of the window, Dante and Mr Casey, who sat in the 
			easychairs at either side of the hearth, Stephen, seated on a 
			chair between them, his feet resting on the toasted boss. Mr 
			Dedalus looked at himself in the pierglass above the mantelpiece, 
			waxed out his moustache-ends and then, parting his 
			coattails, stood with his back to the glowing fire: and still, 
			from time to time, he withdrew a hand from his coattail to 
			wax out one of his moustache-ends. Mr Casey leaned his 
			head to one side and, smiling, tapped the gland of his neck 
			with his fingers. And Stephen smiled too for he knew now that 
			it was not true that Mr Casey had a purse of silver in his 
			throat. He smiled to think how the silvery noise which Mr 
			Casey used to make had deceived him. And when he had tried 
			to open Mr Casey's hand to see if the purse of silver was 
			hidden there he had seen that the fingers could not be straightened 
			out: and Mr Casey had told him that he had got those 
			three cramped fingers making a birthday present for Queen 
			Victoria. </p>
		<p>Mr Casey tapped the gland of his neck and smiled at Stephen 
			with sleepy eyes: and Mr Dedalus said to him: </p>
		<p><said who="Simon Dedalus">—Yes. Well now, that's all right. O, we had a good walk, 
			hadn't we, John? Yes ...  I wonder if there's any likelihood 
			of dinner this evening. Yes ....  O, well now, we got a good 
			breath of ozone round the Head today. Ay, bedad. </sp></p>
		<p>He turned to Dante and said: </p>
		<p><said who="John Casey">—You didn't stir out at all, Mrs Riordan? </said></p>
		<p>Dante frowned and said shortly: </p>
		<p><said who="Dante">—No. </said></p>
		<p>Mr Dedalus dropped his coattails and went over to the 
			sideboard. He brought forth a great stone jar of whisky from 
			the locker and filled the decanter slowly, bending now and 
			then to see how much he had poured in. Then replacing the 
			jar in the locker he poured a little of the whisky into two 
			glasses, added a little water and came back with them to the 
			fireplace. </p>
		<p><said who="Simon Dedalus">—A thimbleful, John, he said, just to whet your appetite. </said></p>
		<p>Mr Casey took the glass, drank, and placed it near him on 
			the mantelpiece. Then he said: </p>
		<p><said who="John Casey">—Well, I can't help thinking of our friend Christopher 
				manufacturing ... </said></p>
		<p>He broke into a fit of laughter and coughing and added: </p>
		<p><said who="John Casey">—... manufacturing that champagne for those fellows. </said></p>
		<p>Mr Dedalus laughed loudly. </p>
		<p><said who="Simon Dedalus">—Is it Christy? he said. There's more cunning in one of 
				those warts on his bald head than in a pack of jack foxes. </said></p>
		<p>He inclined his head, closed his eyes, and, licking his lips 
			profusely, began to speak with the voice of the hotelkeeper. </p>
		<p><said who="Simon Dedalus">—And he has such a soft mouth when he's speaking to you, 
			don't you know. He's very moist and watery about the dewlaps, 
			God bless him. </said></p>
		<p>Mr Casey was still struggling through his fit of coughing and 
			laughter. Stephen, seeing and hearing the hotelkeeper through 
			his father's face and voice, laughed. </p>
		<p>Mr Dedalus put up his eyeglass and, staring down at him, 
			said quietly and kindly: </p>
		<p><said who="Simon Dedalus">—What are you laughing at, you little puppy, you? </said></p>
		<p>The servants entered and placed the dishes on the table. 
			Mrs Dedalus followed and the places were arranged. </p>
		<p><said who="Mary Dedalus">—Sit over, she said. </said></p>
		<p>Mr Dedalus went to the end of the table and said: </p>
		<p><said who="Simon Dedalus">—Now, Mrs Riordan, sit over. John, sit you down, my 
				hearty. </said></p>
		<p>He looked round to where uncle Charles sat and said: </p>
		<p><said who="Simon Dedalus">—Now then, sir, there's a bird here waiting for you. </said></p>
		<p>When all had taken their seats he laid his hand on the cover 
			and then said quickly, withdrawing it: </p>
		<p><said who="Simon Dedalus">—Now, Stephen. </said></p>
		<p>Stephen stood up in his place to say the grace before meals: </p>

		<seg type="prayer"> 
			<said who="Stephen">
				<hi rend="italic">
					<l>Bless us, O Lord, and these Thy gifts which through Thy bounty 
				we are about to receive through Christ Our Lord.</l>
					<l>Amen.</l>
				</hi> 
			</said> 
		</seg>

		<p>All blessed themselves and Mr Dedalus with a sigh of 
			pleasure lifted from the dish the heavy cover pearled around 
			the edge with glistening drops. </p>
		<p>Stephen looked at the plump turkey which had lain, trussed 
			and skewered, on the kitchen table. He knew that his father 
			had paid a guinea for it in Dunn's of D'Olier Street and that 
			the man had prodded it often at the breastbone to show how 
			good it was: and he remembered the man's voice when he had 
			said: </p>
		<p><said who="the butcher">—Take that one, sir. That's the real Ally Daly. </said></p>
		<p>Why did Mr Barrett in Clongowes call his pandybat a 
			turkey? But Clongowes was far away: and the warm heavy 
			smell of turkey and ham and celery rose from the plates and 
			dishes and the great fire was banked high and red in the grate 
			and the green ivy and red holly made you feel so happy and 
			when dinner was ended the big plumpudding would be carried 
			in, studded with peeled almonds and sprigs of holly, with 
			bluish fire running around it and a little green flag flying from 
			the top. </p>
		<p>It was his first Christmas dinner and he thought of his little 
			brothers and sisters who were waiting in the nursery, as he had 
			often waited, till the pudding came. The deep low collar and 
			the Eton jacket made him feel queer and oldish: and that 
			morning when his mother had brought him down to the parlour, 
			dressed for mass, his father had cried. That was because 
			he was thinking of his own father. And uncle Charles had 
			said so too. </p>
		<p>Mr Dedalus covered the dish and began to eat hungrily. 
			Then he said: </p>
		<p><said who="Simon Dedalus">—Poor old Christy, he's nearly lopsided now with roguery. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Mary Dedalus">—Simon, said Mrs Dedalus, you haven't given Mrs Riordan 
				any sauce. </said></p>
		<p>Mr Dedalus seized the sauceboat. </p>
		<p><said who="Simon Dedalus">—Haven't I?  he cried. Mrs Riordan, pity the poor blind. </said></p>
		<p>Dante covered her plate with her hands and said: </p>
		<p><said who="Dante">—No, thanks. </said></p>
		<p>Mr Dedalus turned to uncle Charles. </p>
		<p><said who="Simon Dedalus">—How are you off, sir? </said></p>
		<p><said who="Uncle Charles">—Right as the mail, Simon. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Simon Dedalus">—You, John? </said></p>
		<p><said who="John Casey">—I'm all right. Go on yourself. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Simon Dedalus">—Mary? Here, Stephen, here's something to make your 
				hair curl. </said></p>
		<p>He poured sauce freely over Stephen's plate and set the 
			boat again on the table. Then he asked uncle Charles was it 
			tender. Uncle Charles could not speak because his mouth 
			was full but he nodded that it was. </p>
		<p><said who="Simon Dedalus">—That was a good answer our friend made to the canon. 
				What? said Mr Dedalus. </said></p>
		<p><said who="John Casey">—I didn't think he had that much in him, said Mr Casey. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Simon Dedalus">—<quote>I'll pay you your dues, father, when you cease turning the
						house of God into a pollingbooth.</quote></said></p>
		<p><said who="Dante">—A nice answer, said Dante, for any man calling himself a 
				catholic to give to his priest. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Simon Dedalus">—They have only themselves to blame, said Mr Dedalus 
			suavely. If they took a fool's advice they would confine their 
			attention to religion. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Dante">—It is religion, Dante said. They are doing their duty in 
			warning the people. </said></p>
		<p><said who="John Casey">—We go to the house of God, Mr Casey said, in all humility 
			to pray to our Maker and not to hear election addresses. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Dante">—It is religion, Dante said again. They are right. They must 
			direct their flocks. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Simon Dedalus">—And preach politics from the altar, is it? asked Mr Dedalus. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Dante">—Certainly, said Dante. It is a question of public morality. 
			A priest would not be a priest if he did not tell his flock what is 
			right and what is wrong. </said></p>
		<p>Mrs Dedalus laid down her knife and fork, saying: </p>
		<p><said who="Mary Dedalus">—For pity's sake and for pity sake let us have no political 
				discussion on this day of all days in the year. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Uncle Charles">—Quite right, ma'am, said uncle Charles. Now, Simon, 
				that's quite enough now. Not another word now. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Simon Dedalus">—Yes, yes, said Mr Dedalus quickly. </said></p>
		<p>He uncovered the dish boldly and said: </p>
		<p><said who="Simon Dedalus">—Now then, who's for more turkey? </said></p>
		<p>Nobody answered. Dante said: </p>
		<p><said who="Dante">—Nice language for any catholic to use! </said></p>
		<p><said who="Mary Dedalus">—Mrs Riordan, I appeal to you, said Mrs Dedalus, to let 
				the matter drop now. </said></p>
		<p>Dante turned on her and said: </p>
		<p><said who="Dante">—And am I to sit here and listen to the pastors of my 
				church being flouted? </said></p>
		<p><said who="Simon Dedalus">—Nobody is saying a word against them, said Mr Dedalus, 
				so long as they don't meddle in politics. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Dante">—The bishops and priests of Ireland have spoken, said 
				Dante, and they must be obeyed. </said></p>
		<p><said who="John Casey">—Let them leave politics alone, said Mr Casey, or the 
				people may leave their church alone. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Dante">—You hear? said Dante turning to Mrs Dedalus. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Mary Dedalus">—Mr Casey! Simon! said Mrs Dedalus. Let it end now. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Uncle Charles">—Too bad! Too bad! said uncle Charles. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Simon Dedalus">—What? cried Mr Dedalus. Were we to desert him at the 
				bidding of the English people? </said></p>
		<p><said who="Dante">—He was no longer worthy to lead, said Dante. He was a 
				public sinner. </said></p>
		<p><said who="John Casey">—We are all sinners and black sinners, said Mr Casey 
				coldly. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Dante">—<quote>Woe be to the man by whom the scandal cometh!</quote> said 
			Mrs Riordan. <quote>It would be better for him that a millstone were 
			tied about his neck and that he were cast into the depth of the
			sea rather than that he should scandalise one of these, my least
			little ones.</quote> That is the language of the Holy Ghost.</said></p>
		<p><said who="Simon Dedalus">—And very bad language if you ask me, said Mr Dedalus 
		coolly. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Uncle Charles">—Simon! Simon! said uncle Charles. The boy. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Simon Dedalus">—Yes, yes, said Mr Dedalus. I meant about the ... I 
			was thinking about the bad language of that railway porter. 
			Well now, that's all right. Here, Stephen, show me your plate, 
			old chap. Eat away now. Here. </said></p>
		<p>He heaped up the food on Stephen's plate and served uncle 
			Charles and Mr Casey to large pieces of turkey and splashes 
			of sauce. Mrs Dedalus was eating little and Dante sat with her 
			hands in her lap. She was red in the face. Mr Dedalus rooted 
			with the carvers at the end of the dish and said: </p>
		<p><said who="Simon Dedalus">—There's a tasty bit here we call the pope's nose. If any 
				lady or gentleman ... </said></p>
		<p>He held a piece of fowl up on the prong of the carvingfork. 
			Nobody spoke. He put it on his own plate, saying: </p>
		<p><said who="Simon Dedalus">—Well, you can't say but you were asked. I think I had 
				better eat it myself because I'm not well in my health lately. </said></p>
		<p>He winked at Stephen and, replacing the dishcover, began 
			to eat again. </p>
		<p>There was a silence while he ate. Then he said: </p>
		<p><said who="Simon Dedalus">—Well now, the day kept up fine after all. There were 
				plenty of strangers down too. </said></p>
		<p>Nobody spoke. He said again: </p>
		<p><said who="Simon Dedalus">—I think there were more strangers down than last 
				Christmas. </said></p>
		<p>He looked round at the others whose faces were bent towards 
			their plates and, receiving no reply, waited for a moment 
			and said bitterly: </p>
		<p><said who="Simon Dedalus">—Well, my Christmas dinner has been spoiled anyhow. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Dante">—There could be neither luck nor grace, Dante said, in a 
				house where there is no respect for the pastors of the church. </said></p>
		<p>Mr Dedalus threw his knife and fork noisily on his plate. </p>
		<p><said who="Simon Dedalus">—Respect! he said. Is it for Billy with the lip or for the tub 
				of guts up in Armagh? Respect! </said></p>
		<p><said who="John Casey">—Princes of the church, said Mr Casey with slow scorn. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Simon Dedalus">—Lord Leitrim's coachman, yes, said Mr Dedalus. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Dante">—They are the Lord's anointed, Dante said. They are an 
				honour to their country. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Simon Dedalus">—Tub of guts, said Mr Dedalus coarsely. He has a handsome 
			face, mind you, in repose. You should see that fellow 
			lapping up his bacon and cabbage of a cold winter's day. O 
			Johnny! </said></p>
		<p>He twisted his features into a grimace of heavy bestiality 
			and made a lapping noise with his lips. </p>
		<p><said who="Mary Dedalus">—Really, Simon, said Mrs Dedalus, you should not speak 
				that way before Stephen. It's not right. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Dante">—O, he'll remember all this when he grows up, said Dante 
			hotly - the language he heard against God and religion and 
			priests in his own home. </said></p>
		<p><said who="John Casey">—Let him remember too, cried Mr Casey to her from 
			across the table, the language with which the priests and the 
			priests' pawns broke Parnell's heart and hounded him into 
			his grave. Let him remember that too when he grows up. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Simon Dedalus">—Sons of bitches! cried Mr Dedalus. When he was down 
			they turned on him to betray him and rend him like rats in a 
			sewer. Lowlived dogs! And they look it! By Christ, they look 
			it! </said></p>
		<p><said who="Dante">—They behaved rightly, cried Dante. They obeyed their 
				bishops and their priests. Honour to them! </said></p>
		<p><said who="Mary Dedalus">—Well, it is perfectly dreadful to say that not even for one 
			day in the year, said Mrs Dedalus, can we be free from these 
			dreadful disputes! </said></p>
		<p>Uncle Charles raised his hands mildly and said: </p>
		<p><said who="Uncle Charles">—Come now, come now, come now! Can we not have our 
			opinions whatever they are without this bad temper and this 
			bad language? It is too bad surely. </said></p>
		<p>Mrs Dedalus spoke to Dante in a low voice but Dante said 
			loudly: </p>
		<p><said who="Dante">—I will not say nothing. I will defend my church and my 
				religion when it is insulted and spit on by renegade catholics. </said></p>
		<p>Mr Casey pushed his plate rudely into the middle of the 
			table and, resting his elbows before him, said in a hoarse voice 
			to his host: </p>
		<p><said who="John Casey">—Tell me, did I tell you that story about a very famous 
				spit? </said></p>
		<p><said who="Simon Dedalus">—You did not, John, said Mr Dedalus. </said></p>
		<p><said who="John Casey">—Why then, said Mr Casey, it is a most instructive story. It 
			happened not long ago in the county Wicklow where we are 
			now. </said></p>
		<p>He broke off and, turning towards Dante, said with quiet 
			indignation: </p>
		<p><said who="John Casey">—And I may tell you, ma'am, that I, if you mean me, am 
			no renegade catholic. I am a catholic as my father was and his 
			father before him and his father before him again when we 
			gave up our lives rather than sell our faith. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Dante">—The more shame to you now, Dante said, to speak as you 
				do. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Simon Dedalus">—The story, John, said Mr Dedalus smiling. Let us have 
				the story anyhow. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Dante">—Catholic indeed! repeated Dante ironically. The blackest 
			protestant in the land would not speak the language I have 
			heard this evening. </said></p>
		<p>Mr Dedalus began to sway his head to and fro, crooning 
			like a country singer. </p>
		<p><said who="John Casey">—I am no protestant, I tell you again, said Mr Casey flushing. </said></p>
		<p>Mr Dedalus, still crooning and swaying his head, began to 
			sing in a grunting nasal tone: </p>

		<said who="Simon Dedalus">
			<seg type="song">
				<lg>
					<l>O, come all you Roman catholics</l> 
					<l>That never went to mass.</l> 
				</lg>
			</seg>
		</said>

		<p>He took up his knife and fork again in good humour and set 
			to eating, saying to Mr Casey: </p>
		<p><said who="Simon Dedalus">—Let us have the story, John. It will help us to digest. </said></p>
		<p>Stephen looked with affection at Mr Casey's face which 
			stared across the table over his joined hands. He liked to sit 
			near him at the fire, looking up at his dark fierce face. But his 
			dark eyes were never fierce and his slow voice was good to 
			listen to. But why was he then against the priests? Because 
			Dante must be right then. But he had heard his father say that 
			she was a spoiled nun and that she had come out of the convent 
			in the Alleghanies when her brother had got the money 
			from the savages for the trinkets and the chainies. Perhaps 
			that made her severe against Parnell. And she did not like him 
			to play with Eileen because Eileen was a protestant and when 
			she was young she knew children that used to play with protestants 
			and the protestants used to make fun of the litany of 
			the Blessed Virgin. <hi rend="italic">Tower of Ivory</hi>, they used to say, 
			<hi rend="italic">House of Gold!</hi> How could a woman be a tower of ivory or a house of 
			gold? Who was right then? And he remembered the evening in 
			the infirmary in Clongowes, the dark waters, the light at the 
			pierhead and the moan of sorrow from the people when they 
			had heard. </p>
		<p>Eileen had long white hands. One evening when playing tig 
			she had put her hands over his eyes: long and white and thin 
			and cold and soft. That was ivory: a cold white thing. That 
			was the meaning of <hi rend="italic">Tower of Ivory</hi>. </p>
		<p><said who="John Casey">—The story is very short and sweet, Mr Casey said. It was 
			one day down in Arklow, a cold bitter day, not long before the 
			chief died. May God have mercy on him! </said></p>
		<p>He closed his eyes wearily and paused. Mr Dedalus took a 
			bone from his plate and tore some meat from it with his teeth, 
			saying: </p>
		<p><said who="Simon Dedalus">—Before he was killed, you mean. </said></p>
		<p>Mr Casey opened his eyes, sighed and went on: </p>
		<p><said who="John Casey">—It was down in Arklow one day. We were down there at 
			a meeting and after the meeting was over we had to make our 
			way to the railway station through the crowd. Such booing 
			and baaing, man, you never heard. They called us all the 
			names in the world. Well there was one old lady, and a 
			drunken old harridan she was surely, that paid all her attention 
			to me. She kept dancing along beside me in the mud 
			bawling and screaming into my face: <hi rend="italic">Priesthunter! The Paris 
				Funds! Mr Fox! Kitty O'Shea!</hi> </said></p>
		<p><said who="Simon Dedalus">—And what did you do, John? asked Mr Dedalus. </said></p>
		<p><said who="John Casey">—I let her bawl away, said Mr Casey. It was a cold day and 
				to keep up my heart I had (saving your presence, ma'am) a 
				quid of Tullamore in my mouth and sure I couldn't say a word 
				in any case because my mouth was full of tobacco juice. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Simon Dedalus">—Well, John? </said></p>
		<p><said who="John Casey">—Well. I let her bawl away, to her heart's content, <hi rend="italic">Kitty O'Shea</hi> 
			and the rest of it till at last she called that lady a name 
			that I won't sully this Christmas board nor your ears, ma'am, 
			nor my own lips by repeating. </said></p>
		<p>He paused. Mr Dedalus, lifting his head from the bone, 
			asked: </p>
		<p><said who="Simon Dedalus">—And what did you do, John? </said></p>
		<p><said who="John Casey">—Do! said Mr Casey. She stuck her ugly old face up at me 
			when she said it and I had my mouth full of tobacco juice. I 
			bent down to her and <hi rend="italic">Phth!</hi> says I to her like that. </said></p>
		<p>He turned aside and made the act of spitting. </p>
		<p><said who="John Casey">—<hi rend="italic">Phth!</hi> says I to her like that, right into her eye. </said></p>
		<p>He clapped a hand to his eye and gave a hoarse scream of 
			pain. </p>
		<p><said who="John Casey">—<hi rend="italic">O Jesus, Mary and Joseph!</hi> says she. <hi rend="italic">I'm blinded! I'm 
					blinded and drownded!</hi> </said></p>
		<p>He stopped in a fit of coughing and laughter, repeating: </p>
		<p><said who="John Casey">—<hi rend="italic">I'm blinded entirely.</hi> </said></p>
		<p>Mr Dedalus laughed loudly and lay back in his chair while 
			uncle Charles swayed his head to and fro. </p>
		<p>Dante looked terribly angry and repeated while they 
			laughed: </p>
		<p><said who="Dante">—Very nice! Ha! Very nice! </said></p>
		<p>It was not nice about the spit in the woman's eye. But what 
			was the name the woman had called Kitty O'Shea that Mr 
			Casey would not repeat? He thought of Mr Casey walking 
			through the crowds of people and making speeches from a 
			wagonette. That was what he had been in prison for and he 
			remembered that one night Sergeant O'Neill had come to the 
			house and had stood in the hall, talking in a low voice with his 
			father and chewing nervously at the chinstrap of his cap. And 
			that night Mr Casey had not gone to Dublin by train but a car 
			had come to the door and he had heard his father say something 
			about the Cabinteely road. </p>
		<p>He was for Ireland and Parnell and so was his father: and 
			so was Dante too for one night at the band on the esplanade 
			she had hit a gentleman on the head with her umbrella because 
			he had taken off his hat when the band played <hi rend="italic">God save 
			the Queen</hi> at the end. </p>
		<p>Mr Dedalus gave a snort of contempt. </p>
		<p><said who="Simon Dedalus">—Ah, John, he said. It is true for them. We are an unfortunate 
			priestridden race and always were and always will be till 
			the end of the chapter. </said></p>
		<p>Uncle Charles shook his head, saying: </p>
		<p><said who="Uncle Charles">—A bad business! A bad business! </said></p>
		<p>Mr Dedalus repeated: </p>
		<p><said who="Simon Dedalus">—A priestridden Godforsaken race! </said></p>
		<p>He pointed to the portrait of his grandfather on the wall to 
			his right. </p>
		<p><said who="Simon Dedalus">—Do you see that old chap up there, John? he said. He was 
			a good Irishman when there was no money in the job. He was 
			condemned to death as a whiteboy. But he had a saying about 
			our clerical friends, that he would never let one of them put 
			his two feet under his mahogany. </said></p>
		<p>Dante broke in angrily: </p>
		<p><said who="Dante">—If we are a priestridden race we ought to be proud of it! 
			They are the apple of God's eye. <hi rend="italic">Touch them not, says Christ, 
			for they are the apple of My eye.</hi> </said></p>
		<p><said who="John Casey">—And can we not love our country then? asked Mr 
			Casey. Are we not to follow the man that was born to lead 
			us? </said></p>
	<p><said who="Dante">—A traitor to his country! replied Dante. A traitor, an 
			adulterer! The priests were right to abandon him. The priests 
			were always the true friends of Ireland. </said></p>
	<p><said who="John Casey">—Were they, faith? said Mr Casey. </said></p>
		<p>He threw his fist on the table and, frowning angrily, protruded 
			one finger after another. </p>
		<p><said who="John Casey">—Didn't the bishops of Ireland betray us in the time of the 
			union when bishop Lanigan presented an address of loyalty to 
			the Marquess Cornwallis? Didn't the bishops and priests sell 
			the aspirations of their country in 1829 in return for catholic 
			emancipation? Didn't they denounce the fenian movement 
			from the pulpit and in the confessionbox? And didn't they 
			dishonour the ashes of Terence Bellew MacManus? </said></p>
		<p>His face was glowing with anger and Stephen felt the glow 
			rise to his own cheek as the spoken words thrilled him. Mr 
			Dedalus uttered a guffaw of coarse scorn. </p>
		<p><said who="John Casey">—O, by God, he cried, I forgot little old Paul Cullen! 
				Another apple of God's eye! </said></p>
		<p>Dante bent across the table and cried to Mr Casey: </p>
		<p><said who="Dante">—Right! Right! They were always right! God and morality 
				and religion come first. </said></p>
		<p>Mrs Dedalus, seeing her excitement, said to her: </p>
		<p><said who="Mary Dedalus">—Mrs Riordan, don't excite yourself answering them. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Dante">—God and religion before everything! Dante cried. God 
				and religion before the world! </said></p>
		<p>Mr Casey raised his clenched fist and brought it down on 
			the table with a crash. </p>
		<p><said who="John Casey">—Very well, then, he shouted hoarsely, if it comes to that, 
				no God for Ireland! </said></p>
		<p><said who="Simon Dedalus">—John! John! cried Mr Dedalus, seizing his guest by the 
				coatsleeve. </said></p>
		<p>Dante stared across the table, her cheeks shaking. Mr 
			Casey struggled up from his chair and bent across the table 
			towards her, scraping the air from before his eyes with one 
			hand as though he were tearing aside a cobweb. </p>
		<p><said who="John Casey">—No God for Ireland! he cried. We have had too much 
				God in Ireland. Away with God! </said></p>
		<p><said who="Dante">—Blasphemer! Devil! screamed Dante, starting to her feet 
				and almost spitting in his face. </said></p>
		<p>Uncle Charles and Mr Dedalus pulled Mr Casey back into 
			his chair again, talking to him from both sides reasonably. He 
			stared before him out of his dark flaming eyes, repeating: </p>
		<p><said who="John Casey">—Away with God, I say! </said></p>
		<p>Dante shoved her chair violently aside and left the table, 
			upsetting her napkinring which rolled slowly along the carpet 
			and came to rest against the foot of an easychair. Mrs 
			Dedalus rose quickly and followed her towards the door. At 
			the door Dante turned round violently and shouted down the 
			room, her cheeks flushed and quivering with rage: </p>
		<p><said who="Dante">—Devil out of hell! We won! We crushed him to death! 
				Fiend! </said></p>
		<p>The door slammed behind her. </p>
		<p>Mr Casey, freeing his arms from his holders, suddenly 
			bowed his head on his hands with a sob of pain. </p>
		<p><said who="John Casey">—Poor Parnell! he cried loudly. My dead king! </said></p>
		<p>He sobbed loudly and bitterly. </p>
		<p>Stephen, raising his terrorstricken face, saw that his father's 
			eyes were full of tears. </p>

	<div n="1.4" type="section"> 

		<p>The fellows talked together in little groups. </p>
		<p>One fellow said: </p>
		<p><said who="a fellow">—They were caught near the Hill of Lyons. </said></p>
		<p><said who="a fellow">—Who caught them? </said></p>
		<p><said who="a fellow">—Mr Gleeson and the minister. They were on a car. </said></p>
		<p>The same fellow added: </p>
		<p><said who="a fellow">—A fellow in the higher line told me. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Fleming">Fleming asked: </said></p>
		<p><said who="a fellow">—But why did they run away, tell us? </said></p>
		<p><said who="Cecil Thunder">—I know why, Cecil Thunder said. Because they had 
				fecked cash out of the rector's room. </said></p>
		<p><said who="a fellow">—Who fecked it? </said></p>
		<p><said who="John Casey">—Kickham's brother. And they all went shares in it. </said></p>
		<p>But that was stealing. How could they have done that? </p>
		<p><said who="Wells">—A fat lot you know about it, Thunder! Wells said. I know 
				why they scut. </said></p>
		<p><said who="a fellow">—Tell us why. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Wells">—I was told not to, Wells said. </said></p>
		<p><said who="all">—O, go on, Wells, all said. You might tell us. We won't let 
				it out. </said></p>
		<p>Stephen bent forward his head to hear. Wells looked round 
			to see if anyone was coming. Then he said secretly: </p>
		<p><said who="Wells">—You know the altar wine they keep in the press in the 
				sacristy? </said></p>
		<p><said who="all">—Yes. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Wells">—Well, they drank that and it was found out who did it by 
				the smell. And that's why they ran away, if you want to know. </said></p>
		<p>And the fellow who had spoken first said: </p>
		<p><said who="a fellow">—Yes, that's what I heard too from the fellow in the higher 
				line. </said></p>
		<p>The fellows were all silent. Stephen stood among them, 
			afraid to speak, listening. A faint sickness of awe made him 
			feel weak. How could they have done that? He thought of the 
			dark silent sacristy. There were dark wooden presses there 
			where the crimped surplices lay quietly folded. It was not the 
			chapel but still you had to speak under your breath. It was a 
			holy place. He remembered the summer evening he had been 
			there to be dressed as boatbearer, the evening of the procession 
			to the little altar in the wood. A strange and holy place. 
			The boy that held the censer had swung it gently to and fro 
			near the door with the silvery cap lifted by the middle chain 
			to keep the coals lighting. That was called charcoal: and it 
			had burned quietly as the fellow had swung it gently and had 
			given off a weak sour smell. And then when all were vested 
			he had stood holding out the boat to the rector and the rector 
			had put a spoonful of incense in it and it had hissed on the 
			red coals. </p>
		<p>The fellows were talking together in little groups here and 
			there on the playground. The fellows seemed to him to have 
			grown smaller: that was because a sprinter had knocked him 
			down the day before, a fellow out of second of grammar. He 
			had been thrown by the fellow's machine lightly on the cinderpath 
			and his spectacles had been broken in three pieces and 
			some of the grit of the cinders had gone into his mouth. </p>
		<p>That was why the fellows seemed to him smaller and 
			farther away and the goalposts so thin and far and the soft 
			grey sky so high up. But there was no play on the football 
			grounds for cricket was coming: and some said that Barnes 
			would be the prof and some said it would be Flowers. And all 
			over the playgrounds they were playing rounders and bowling 
			twisters and lobs. And from here and from there came the 
			sounds of the cricketbats through the soft grey air. They said: 
			pick, pack, pock, puck: like drops of water in a fountain 
			slowly falling in the brimming bowl. </p>
		<p>Athy, who had been silent, said quietly: </p>
		<p><said who="Athy">—You are all wrong. </said></p>
		<p>All turned towards him eagerly. </p>
		<p><said who="a fellow">—Why? </said></p>
		<p><said who="a fellow">—Do you know? </said></p>
		<p><said who="a fellow">—Who told you? </said></p>
		<p><said who="a fellow">—Tell us, Athy. </said></p>
		<p>Athy pointed across the playground to where Simon Moonan 
			was walking by himself kicking a stone before him. </p>
		<p><said who="Athy">—Ask him, he said. </said></p>
		<p>The fellows looked there and then said: </p>
		<p><said who="a fellow">—Why him? </said></p>
		<p><said who="a fellow">—Is he in it? </said></p>
		<p><said who="a fellow">—Tell us, Athy. Go on. You might if you know. </said></p>
		<p>Athy lowered his voice and said: </p>
		<p><said who="Athy">—Do you know why those fellows scut? I will tell you but 
				you must not let on you know. </said></p>
		<p>He paused for a moment and then said mysteriously: </p>
		<p><said who="Athy">—They were caught with Simon Moonan and Tusker Boyle 
				in the square one night. </said></p>
		<p>The fellows looked at him and asked: </p>
		<p><said who="a fellow">—Caught? </said></p>
		<p><said who="a fellow">—What doing? </said></p>
		<p>Athy said: </p>
		<p><said who="Athy">—Smugging. </said></p>
		<p>All the fellows were silent: and Athy said: </p>
		<p><said who="Athy">—And that's why. </said></p>
		<p>Stephen looked at the faces of the fellows but they were all 
			looking across the playground. He wanted to ask somebody 
			about it. What did that mean about the smugging in the 
			square? Why did the five fellows out of the higher line run 
			away for that? It was a joke, he thought. Simon Moonan had 
			nice clothes and one night he had shown him a ball of creamy 
			sweets that the fellows of the football fifteen had rolled down 
			to him along the carpet in the middle of the refectory when he 
			was at the door. It was the night of the match against the 
			Bective Rangers and the ball was made just like a red and 
			green apple only it opened and it was full of the creamy 
			sweets. And one day Boyle had said that an elephant had two 
			tuskers instead of two tusks and that was why he was called 
			Tusker Boyle but some fellows called him Lady Boyle because 
			he was always at his nails, paring them. </p>
		<p>Eileen had long thin cool white hands too because she was a 
			girl. They were like ivory; only soft. That was the meaning of 
			<i>Tower of Ivory</i> but protestants could not understand it and 
			made fun of it. One day he had stood beside her looking into 
			the hotel grounds. A waiter was running up a trail of bunting 
			on the flagstaff and a fox terrier was scampering to and fro on 
			the sunny lawn. She had put her hand into his pocket where 
			his hand was and he had felt how cool and thin and soft her 
			hand was. She had said that pockets were funny things to 
			have: and then all of a sudden she had broken away and had 
			run laughing down the sloping curve of the path. Her fair hair 
			had streamed out behind her like gold in the sun. <hi rend="italic">Tower of
			Ivory. House of Gold.</hi> By thinking of things you could understand 
			them. </p>
		<p>But why in the square? You went there when you wanted to 
			do something. It was all thick slabs of slate and water trickled 
			all day out of tiny pinholes and there was a queer smell of stale 
			water there. And behind the door of one of the  closets there 
			was a drawing in red pencil of a bearded man in a Roman 
			dress with a brick in each hand and underneath was the name 
			of the drawing: </p>

		<l><i>Balbus was building a wall.</i> </l>

		<p>Some fellows had drawn it there for a cod. It had a funny 
			face but it was very like a man with a beard. And on the wall 
			of another closet there was written in backhand  in beautiful 
			writing: </p>

		<l>Julius Caesar wrote The Calico Belly. </l>

		<p>Perhaps that was why they were there  because it was a 
			place where some fellows wrote things for cod. But all the 
			same it was queer what Athy said and the way he said it. It 
			was not a cod because they had run away. He looked with the 
			others in silence across the playground and began to feel 
			afraid. </p>
		<p>At last Fleming said: </p>
		<p><said who="Fleming">—And we are all to be punished for what other fellows did? </said></p>
		<p><said who="Cecil Thunder">—I won't come back, see if I do, Cecil Thunder said. Three 
				days' silence in the refectory and sending us up for six and 
				eight every minute. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Wells">—Yes, said Wells. And old Barrett has a new way of twisting 
				the note so that you can't open it and fold it again to see 
				how many ferul#.^a  you are to get. I won't come back too. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Cecil Thunder">—Yes, said Cecil Thunder, and the prefect of studies was in 
				second of grammar this morning. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Fleming">—Let us get up a rebellion, Fleming said. Will we? </said></p>
		<p>All the fellows were silent. The air was very silent and you 
			could hear the cricketbats but more slowly than before: pick, 
			pock. </p>
		<p>Wells asked: </p>
		<p><said who="Wells">—What is going to be done to them? </said></p>
		<p><said who="Athy">—Simon Moonan and Tusker are going to be flogged, Athy 
				said, and the fellows in the higher line got their choice of 
				flogging or being expelled. </said></p>
		<p><said who="a fellow">—And which are they taking? asked the fellow who had 
				spoken first. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Athy">—All are taking expulsion except Corrigan, Athy answered. 
				He's going to be flogged by Mr Gleeson. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Fleming">—Is it Corrigan that big fellow? said Fleming. Why, he'd be 
				able for two of Gleeson! </said></p>
		<p><said who="Cecil Thunder">—I know why, Cecil Thunder said. He is right and the 
				other fellows are wrong because a flogging wears off after a bit 
				but a fellow that has been expelled from college is known all 
				his life on  account of it. Besides Gleeson won't flog him hard. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Fleming">—It's best of his play not to, Fleming said. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Cecil Thunder">—I wouldn't like to be Simon Moonan and Tusker,  Cecil 
				Thunder said. But I don't believe they will be flogged. Perhaps 
				they will be sent up for twice nine. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Athy">—No, no, said Athy. They'll both get it on the vital spot. </said></p>
		<p>Wells rubbed himself and said in a crying voice: </p>
		<p><said who="Wells">—Please, sir, let me off! </said></p>
		<p>Athy grinned and turned up the sleeves of his jacket, saying: </p>

		<said who="Athy">
			<seg type="chant">
				<lg>
					<l>It can't be helped;</l> 
					<l>It must be done.</l> 
					<l>So down with your breeches</l> 
					<l>And out with your bum.</l> 
				</lg>
			</seg>
		</said> 

		<p>The fellows laughed; but he felt that they were a little 
			afraid. In the silence of the soft grey air he heard the cricket-bats 
			from here and from there: pock. That was a sound to 
			hear but if you were hit then you would feel a pain. The pandybat 
			made a sound too but not like that. The fellows said it 
			was made of whalebone and leather with lead inside: and he 
			wondered what was the pain like. There were different kinds 
			of pains  for all the different kinds of sounds. A long thin cane 
			would have a high whistling sound and he wondered what was 
			that pain like. It made him shivery to think of it and cold: and 
			what Athy said too. But what was there to laugh at in it? It 
			made him shivery: but that was because you always felt like a 
			shiver when you let down your trousers. It was the same in the 
			bath when you undressed yourself. He wondered who had to 
			let them down, the master or the boy himself. O how could 
			they laugh about it that way? </p>
		<p>He looked at Athy's rolledup sleeves and knuckly inky 
			hands. He had rolled up his sleeves to show how Mr Gleeson 
			would roll up his sleeves. But Mr Gleeson had round shiny 
			cuffs and clean white wrists and fattish white hands and the 
			nails of them were long and pointed. Perhaps he pared them 
			too like Lady Boyle. But they were terribly long and pointed 
			nails. So long and cruel they were though the white fattish 
			hands were not cruel but gentle. And though he trembled with 
			cold and fright to think of the cruel long nails and of the high 
			whistling sound of the cane and of the chill you felt at the end 
			of your shirt when you undressed yourself yet he felt a feeling 
			of queer quiet pleasure inside him to think of the white fattish 
			hands, clean and strong  and gentle. And he thought of what 
			Cecil Thunder had said; that Mr Gleeson would not flog 
			Corrigan hard. And Fleming had said he would not because it 
			was  best of his play not to. But that was not why. </p>
		<p>A voice from far out on the playground cried: </p>
		<p><said who="a fellow">—All in! </said></p>
		<p>And other voices cried: </p>
		<p><said who="other voices">—All in! All in! </said></p>
		<p>During the writing lesson he sat with his arms folded, 
			listening to the slow scraping of the pens. Mr Harford went to 
			and fro making little signs in red pencil and sometimes sitting 
			beside the boy to show him how to hold the pen. He had tried 
			to spell out the headline for himself though he knew already 
			what it was for it was the last of the book. <hi rend="italic">Zeal without prudence
			is like a ship adrift.</hi> But the lines of the letters were like 
			fine invisible threads and it was only by closing his right eye 
			tight tight and staring out of the left eye that he could make 
			out the full curves of the capital. </p>
		<p>But Mr Harford was very decent and never got into a wax. 
			All the other masters got into dreadful waxes. But why were 
			they to suffer for what fellows in the higher line did? Wells had 
			said that they had drunk some of the altar wine out of the 
			press in the sacristy and that it had been found out who had 
			done it by the smell. Perhaps they had stolen a monstrance to 
			run away with it and sell it somewhere. That must have been a 
			terrible sin, to go in there quietly at night, to open the dark 
			press and steal the flashing gold thing into which God was put 
			on the altar in the middle of flowers and candles at benediction 
			while the incense went up in clouds at both sides as the 
			fellow swung the censer and Dominic Kelly sang the first part 
			by himself in the choir. But God was not in it of course when 
			they stole it. But still it was a strange and a great sin even to 
			touch it. He thought of it with deep awe; a terrible and strange 
			sin: it thrilled him to think of it in the silence when the pens 
			scraped lightly. But to drink the altar wine out of the press 
			and be found out by the smell was a sin too: but it was not 
			terrible and strange. It only made you feel a little sickish on 
			account of the smell of the wine. Because on the day when he 
			had made his first holy communion in  the chapel he had shut 
			his eyes and opened his mouth and put out his tongue a little: 
			and when the rector had stooped down to give him the holy 
			communion he had smelt a faint winy smell off the rector's 
			breath after the wine of the mass. The word was beautiful: 
			wine. It made you think of dark purple because the grapes 
			were dark purple that grew in Greece outside houses like 
			white temples. But the faint smell off the rector's breath had 
			made him feel a sick feeling on the morning of his first communion. 
			The day of your first communion was the happiest 
			day of your life. And once a lot of generals had asked Napoleon 
			what was the happiest day of his life. They thought he 
			would say the day he won some great battle or the day he was 
			made an emperor. But he said: </p>
		<p><said who="Napoleon">—Gentlemen, the happiest day of my life was the day on 
				which I made my first holy communion. </said></p>
		<p>Father Arnall came in and the Latin lesson began and he 
			remained still, leaning on the desk with his arms folded. Father 
			Arnall gave out the themebooks and he said that they 
			were scandalous and that they were all to be written out again 
			with the corrections at once. But the worst of all was Fleming's 
			theme because the pages were stuck together by a blot: 
			and Father Arnall held it up by a corner and said it was an 
			insult to any master to send him up such a theme. Then he 
			asked Jack Lawton to decline the noun <hi rend="italic">mare</hi> and Jack Lawton 
			stopped at the ablative singular and could not go on with the 
			plural. </p>
		<p><said who="Father Arnall">—You should be ashamed of yourself, said Father Arnall 
				sternly. You, the leader of the class! </said></p>
		<p>Then he asked the next boy and the next and the next. 
			Nobody knew. Father Arnall became very quiet, more and 
			more quiet as each boy tried to answer and could not. But his 
			face was blacklooking and his eyes were staring though his 
			voice was so quiet. Then he asked Fleming and Fleming said 
			that that word had no plural. Father Arnall suddenly shut the 
			book and shouted at him: </p>
		<p><said who="Father Arnall">—Kneel out there in the middle of the class. You are one of 
			the idlest boys I ever met. Copy out your themes again the rest 
			of you. </said></p>
		<p>Fleming moved heavily out of his place and knelt between 
			the two last benches. The others boys bent over their theme-books 
			and began to write. A silence filled the classroom and 
			Stephen, glancing timidly at Father Arnall's dark face, saw that 
			it was a little red from the wax he was in. </p>
		<p>Was that a sin for Father Arnall to be in a wax or was he 
			allowed to get into a wax when the boys were idle because that 
			made them study better or was he only letting on to be in a 
			wax? It was because he was allowed because a priest would 
			know what a sin was and would not do it. But if he did it one 
			time by mistake what would he do to go to confession? Perhaps 
			he would go to confession to the minister. And if the 
			minister did it he would go to the rector: and the rector to the 
			provincial: and the provincial to the general of the jesuits. 
			That was called the order: and he had heard his father say 
			that they were all clever men. They could all have become 
			highup people in the world if they had not become jesuits. 
			And he wondered what Father Arnall and Paddy Barrett 
			would have become and what Mr McGlade and Mr Gleeson 
			would have become if they had not become jesuits. It was hard 
			to think what because you would have to think of them in a 
			different way with different coloured coats and trousers and 
			with beards and moustaches and different kinds of hats. </p>
		<p>The door opened quietly and closed. A quick whisper ran 
			through the class: the prefect of studies. There was an instant 
			of dead silence and then the loud crack of a pandybat on the 
			last desk. Stephen's heart leapt up in fear. </p>
		<p><said who="Father Dolan">—Any boys want flogging here, Father Arnall? cried the 
			prefect of studies. Any lazy idle loafers that want flogging in 
			this class? </said></p>
		<p>He came to the middle of the class and saw Fleming on his 
			knees. </p>
		<p><said who="Father Dolan">—Hoho! he cried. Who is this boy? Why is he on his knees? 
				What is your name, boy? </said></p>
		<p><said who="Fleming">—Fleming, sir. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Father Dolan">—Hoho, Fleming! An idler of course. I can see it in your 
				eye. Why is he on his knees, Father Arnall? </said></p>
		<p><said who="Father Arnall">—He wrote a bad Latin theme, Father Arnall said, and he 
				missed all the questions in grammar. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Father Dolan">—Of course he did! cried the prefect of studies. Of course 
				he did! A born idler! I can see it in the corner of his eye. </said></p>
		<p>He banged his pandybat down on the desk and cried: </p>
		<p><said who="Father Dolan">—Up, Fleming! Up, my boy! </said></p>
		<p>Fleming stood up slowly. </p>
		<p><said who="Father Dolan">—Hold out! cried the prefect of studies. </said></p>
		<p>Fleming held out his hand. The pandybat came down on it 
			with a loud smacking sound: one, two, three, four, five, six. </p>
		<p><said who="Father Dolan">—Other hand! </said></p>
		<p>The pandybat came down again in six loud quick smacks. </p>
		<p><said who="Father Dolan">—Kneel down! cried the prefect of studies. </said></p>
		<p>Fleming knelt down squeezing his hands under his armpits, 
			his face contorted with pain, but Stephen knew how hard his 
			hands were because Fleming was always rubbing rosin into 
			them. But perhaps he was in great pain for the noise of the 
			pandies was terrible. Stephen's heart was beating and fluttering. </p>
		<p><said who="Father Dolan">—At your work, all of you! shouted the prefect of studies. 
			We want no lazy idle loafers here, lazy idle little schemers. At 
			your work, I tell you. Father Dolan will be in to see you every 
			day. Father Dolan will be in tomorrow. </said></p>
		<p>He poked one of the boys in the side with the pandybat, 
			saying: </p>
		<p><said who="Father Dolan">—You, boy! When will Father Dolan be in again? </said></p>
		<p><said who="Tom Furlong">—Tomorrow, sir, said Tom Furlong's voice. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Father Dolan">—Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow, said the prefect 
			of studies. Make up your minds for that. Every day Father 
			Dolan. Write away. You, boy, who are you? </said></p>
		<p>Stephen's heart jumped suddenly. </p>
		<p><said who="Stephen">—Dedalus, sir. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Father Dolan">—Why are you not writing like the others? </said></p>
		<p><said who="Stephen">—I ... my ... </said></p>
		<p>He could not speak with fright. </p>
		<p><said who="Father Dolan">—Why is he not writing, Father Arnall? </said></p>
		<p><said who="Father Arnall">—He broke his glasses, said Father Arnall, and I exempted 
				him from work. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Father Dolan">—Broke? What is this I hear? What is this your name is? 
				said the prefect of studies. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Stephen">—Dedalus, sir. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Father Dolan">—Out here, Dedalus. Lazy little schemer. I see schemer in 
				your face. Where did you break your glasses? </said></p>
		<p>Stephen stumbled into the middle of the class, blinded by 
			fear and haste. </p>
		<p><said who="Father Dolan">—Where did you break your glasses? repeated the prefect 
				of studies. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Stephen">—The cinderpath, sir. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Father Dolan">—Hoho! The cinderpath! cried the prefect of studies. I 
				know that trick. </said></p>
		<p>Stephen lifted his eyes in wonder and saw for a moment 
			Father Dolan's whitegrey not young face, his baldy whitegrey 
			head with fluff at the sides of it, the steel rims of his spectacles 
			and his nocoloured eyes looking through the glasses. Why did 
			he say he knew that trick? </p>
		<p><said who="Father Dolan">—Lazy idle little loafer! cried the prefect of studies. Broke 
			my glasses! An old schoolboy trick! Out with your hand this 
			moment! </said></p>
		<p>Stephen closed his eyes and held out in the air his trembling 
			hand with the palm upwards. He felt the prefect of studies 
			touch it for a moment at the fingers to straighten it and then 
			the swish of the sleeve of the soutane as the pandybat was 
			lifted to strike. A hot burning stinging tingling blow like the 
			loud crack of a broken stick made his trembling hand crumple 
			together like a leaf in the fire: and at the sound and the pain 
			scalding tears were driven into his eyes. His whole body was 
			shaking with fright, his arm was shaking and his crumpled 
			burning livid hand shook like a loose leaf in the air. A cry 
			sprang to his lips, a prayer to be let off. But though the tears 
			scalded his eyes and his limbs quivered with pain and fright he 
			held back the hot tears and the cry that scalded his throat. </p>
		<p><said who="Father Dolan">—Other hand! shouted the prefect of studies. </said></p>
		<p>Stephen drew back his maimed and quivering right arm and 
			held out his left hand. The soutane sleeve swished again as the 
			pandybat was lifted and a loud crashing sound and a fierce 
			maddening tingling burning pain made his hand shrink together 
			with the palms and fingers in a livid quivering mass. 
			The scalding water burst forth from his eyes and, burning with 
			shame and agony and fear, he drew back his shaking arm in 
			terror and burst out into a whine of pain. His body shook with 
			a palsy of fright and in shame and rage he felt the scalding cry 
			come from his throat and the scalding tears falling out of his 
			eyes and down his flaming cheeks. </p>
		<p><said who="Father Dolan">—Kneel down! cried the prefect of studies. </said></p>
		<p>Stephen knelt down quickly pressing his beaten hands to his 
			sides. To think of them  beaten and swollen with pain all in a 
			moment made him feel so sorry for them as if they were not 
			his own but someone else's that he felt sorry for. And as he 
			knelt, calming the last sobs in his throat and feeling the burning 
			tingling pain pressed in to his sides, he thought of the 
			hands which he had held out in the air with the palms up and 
			of the firm touch of the prefect of studies when he had steadied 
			the shaking fingers and of the beaten swollen reddened 
			mass of palm and fingers that shook helplessly  in the air. </p>
		<p><said who="Father Dolan">—Get at your work, all of you, cried the prefect of studies 
			from the door. Father Dolan will be in every day to see if any 
			boy, any lazy idle little loafer wants flogging. Every day. 
			Every day. </said></p>
		<p>The door closed behind him. </p>
		<p>The hushed class continued to copy out the themes. Father 
			Arnall rose from his seat and went among them, helping the 
			boys with gentle words and telling them the mistakes they had 
			made. His voice was very gentle and soft. Then he returned to 
			his seat and said to Fleming and Stephen: </p>
		<p><said who="Father Arnall">—You may return to your places, you two. </said></p>
		<p>Fleming and Stephen rose and, walking to their seats, sat 
			down. Stephen, scarlet with shame, opened a book quickly 
			with one weak hand and bent down upon it, his face close to 
			the page. </p>
		<p>It was unfair and cruel because the doctor had told him not 
			to read without glasses and he had written home to his father 
			that morning to send him a new pair. And Father Arnall had 
			said that he need not study till the new glasses came. Then to 
			be called a schemer before the class and to be pandied when 
			he always got the card for first or second and was the leader of 
			the Yorkists! How could the prefect of studies know that it 
			was a trick? He felt the touch of the prefect's fingers as they 
			had steadied his hand and at first he had thought he was going 
			to shake hands with him because the fingers were soft and 
			firm: but then in an instant he had heard the swish of the 
			soutane sleeve and the crash. It was cruel and unfair to make 
			him kneel in the middle of the class then: and Father Arnall 
			had told them both that they might return to their places 
			without making any difference between them. He listened to 
			Father Arnall's low and gentle voice as he corrected the 
			themes. Perhaps he was sorry now and wanted to be decent. 
			But it was unfair and cruel. The prefect of studies was a priest 
			but that was cruel and unfair. And his whitegrey face and the 
			nocoloured eyes behind the steelrimmed spectacles were 
			cruel looking because he had steadied the hand first with his 
			firm soft fingers and that was to hit it better and louder. </p>
		<p><said who="Fleming">—It's a stinking mean thing, that's what it is, said Fleming 
			in the corridor as the classes were passing out in file to the 
			refectory, to pandy a fellow for what is not his fault. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Nasty Roche">—You really broke your glasses by accident, didn't you? 
			Nasty Roche asked. </said></p>
		<p>Stephen felt his heart filled by Fleming's words and did not 
			answer. </p>
		<p><said who="Fleming">—Of course he did! said Fleming. I wouldn't stand it. I'd go 
				up and tell the rector on him. </said></p>
			<p><said who="Cecil Thunder">—Yes, said Cecil Thunder eagerly, and I saw him lift the 
				pandybat over his shoulder and he's not allowed to do that. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Nasty Roche">—Did they hurt much? Nasty Roche asked. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Stephen">—Very much, Stephen said. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Fleming">—I wouldn't stand it, Fleming repeated, from Baldyhead or 
			any other Baldyhead. It's a stinking mean low trick, that's 
			what it is. I'd go straight up to the rector and tell him about it 
			after dinner. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Cecil Thunder">—Yes, do. Yes, do, said Cecil Thunder. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Nasty Roche">—Yes, do. Yes, go up and tell the rector on him, Dedalus, 
			said Nasty Roche, because he said that he'd come in tomorrow 
			again to pandy you. </said></p>
	<p><said who="all">—Yes, yes. Tell the rector, all said. </said></p>
		<p>And there were some fellows out of second of grammar 
			listening and one of them said: </p>
		<p><said who="some fellows out of second of grammar">—The senate and the Roman people declared that Dedalus 
				had been wrongly punished. </said></p>
		<p>It was wrong; it was unfair and cruel: and, as he sat in the 
			refectory, he suffered time after time in memory the same 
			humiliation until he began to wonder whether it might not 
			really be that there was something in his face which made him 
			look like a schemer and he wished he had a little mirror to see. 
			But there could not be; and it was unjust and cruel and unfair. </p>
		<p>He could not eat the blackish fish fritters they got on 
			Wednesdays in Lent and one of his potatoes had the mark of 
			the spade in it. Yes, he would do what the fellows had told 
			him. He would go up and tell the rector that he had been 
			wrongly punished. A thing like that had been done before by 
			somebody in history, by some great person whose head was in 
			the books of history. And the rector would declare that he had 
			been wrongly punished because the senate and the Roman 
			people always declared that the men who did that had been 
			wrongly punished. Those were the great men whose names 
			were in Richmal Magnall's Questions. History was all about 
			those men and what they did and that was what Peter Parley's 
			Tales about Greece and Rome were all about. Peter Parley 
			himself was on the first page in a picture. There was a road 
			over a heath with grass at the side and little bushes: and Peter 
			Parley had a broad hat like a protestant minister and a big 
			stick and he was walking fast along the road to Greece and 
			Rome. </p>
		<p>It was easy what he had to do. All he had to do  was when 
			the dinner was over and he came out in his turn to go on 
			walking but not out to the corridor but up the staircase on the 
			right that led to the castle. He had nothing to do but that: to 
			turn to the right and walk fast up the staircase and in half a 
			minute he would be in the low dark narrow corridor that led 
			through the castle to the rector's room. And every fellow 
			had said that it was unfair, even the fellow out of second of 
			grammar who had said that about the senate and the Roman 
			people. </p>
		<p>What would happen? He heard the fellows of the higher 
			line stand up at the top of the refectory and heard their steps 
			as they came down the matting: Paddy Rath and Jimmy 
			Magee and the Spaniard and the Portuguese and the fifth was 
			big Corrigan who was going to be flogged by Mr Gleeson. 
			That was why the prefect of studies had called him a schemer 
			and pandied him for nothing: and, straining his weak eyes, 
			tired with the tears, he watched big Corrigan's broad shoulders 
			and big hanging black head passing in the file. But he had 
			done something and besides Mr Gleeson would not flog him 
			hard: and he remembered how big Corrigan looked in the 
			bath. He had skin the same colour as the turfcoloured bogwater 
			in the shallow end of the bath and when he walked 
			along the side his feet slapped loudly on the wet tiles and at 
			every step his thighs  shook a little because he was fat. </p>
		<p>The refectory was half empty and the fellows were still 
			passing out in file. He could go up the staircase because there 
			was never a priest or a prefect outside the refectory door. But 
			he could not go. The rector would side with the prefect of 
			studies and think it was a schoolboy trick and then the prefect 
			of studies would come in every day the same only it would be 
			worse because he would be dreadfully waxy at any fellow 
			going up to the rector about him. The fellows had told him to 
			go but they would not go themselves. They had forgotten all 
			about it. No, it was best to forget all about it and perhaps the 
			prefect of studies had only said he would come in. No, it was 
			best to hide out of the way because when you were small and 
			young you could often escape that way. </p>
		<p>The fellows at his table stood up. He stood up and passed 
			out among them in the file. He had to decide. He was coming 
			near the door. If he went on with the fellows he could never go 
			up to the rector because he could not leave the playground for 
			that. And if he went and was pandied all the same all the 
			fellows would make fun and talk about young Dedalus going 
			up to the rector to tell on the prefect of studies. </p>
		<p>He was walking down along the matting and he saw the 
			door before him. It was impossible: he could not. He thought 
			of the baldy head of the prefect of studies with the cruel 
			nocoloured eyes looking at him and he heard the voice of the 
			prefect of studies asking him twice what his name was. Why 
			could he not remember the name when he was told the first 
			time? Was he not listening the first time or was it to make fun 
			out of the name? The great men in the history had names like 
			that and nobody made fun of them. It was his own name that 
			he should have made fun of if he wanted to make fun. Dolan: 
			it was like the name of a woman that washed clothes. </p>
		<p>He had reached the door and, turning quickly up to the 
			right, walked up the stairs and, before he could make up his 
			mind to come back, he had entered the low dark narrow 
			corridor that led to the castle. And as he crossed the threshold 
			of the door of the corridor  he saw, without turning his head to 
			look, that all the fellows were looking after him as they went 
			filing by. </p>
		<p>He passed along the narrow dark corridor, passing little 
			doors that were the doors of the rooms of the community. He 
			peered in front of him and right and left through the gloom 
			and thought that those must be portraits. It was dark and 
			silent and his eyes were weak and tired with tears so that he 
			could not see. But he thought they were the portraits of the 
			saints and great men of the order who were looking down on 
			him silently as he passed: saint Ignatius Loyola holding an 
			open book and pointing to the words <seg xml:lang="lat"><hi rend="italic">Ad Majorem Dei
			Gloriam</hi></seg> in it, saint Francis Xavier pointing to his chest, 
			Lorenzo Ricci with his berretta on his head like one of the 
			prefects of the lines, the three patrons of holy youth, saint 
			Stanislaus Kostka, saint Aloysius Gonzaga and blessed John 
			Berchmans, all with young faces because they died when they 
			were young, and Father Peter Kenny sitting in a chair wrapped 
			in a big cloak. </p>
		<p>He came out on the landing above the entrance hall and 
			looked about him. That was where Hamilton Rowan had 
			passed and the marks of the soldiers' slugs were there. And it 
			was there that the old servants had seen the ghost in the white 
			cloak of a marshal. </p>
		<p>An old servant was sweeping at the end of the landing. He 
			asked him where was the rector's room and the old servant 
			pointed to the door at the far end and looked after him as he 
			went on to it and knocked. </p>
		<p>There was no answer. He knocked again more loudly and 
			his heart jumped when he heard a muffled voice say: </p>
		<p><said who="the rector">—Come in! </said></p>
		<p>He turned the handle and opened the door and fumbled for 
			the handle of the green baize door inside. He found it and 
			pushed it open and went in. </p>
		<p>He saw the rector sitting at a desk writing. There was a 
			skull on the desk and a strange solemn smell in the room like 
			the old leather of chairs. </p>
		<p>His heart was beating fast on account of the solemn place 
			he was in and the silence of the room:  and he looked at the 
			skull and at the rector's kindlooking face. </p>
		<p><said who="the rector">—Well, my little man, said the rector, what is it? </said></p>
		<p>Stephen swallowed down the thing in his throat and said: </p>
		<p><said who="Stephen">—I broke my glasses, sir. </said></p>
		<p>The rector opened his mouth and said: </p>
		<p><said who="the rector">—O! </said></p>
		<p>Then he smiled and said: </p>
		<p><said who="the rector">—Well, if we broke our glasses we must write home for a 
				new pair. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Stephen">—I wrote home, sir, said Stephen, and Father Arnall said I 
				am not to study till they come. </said></p>
		<p><said who="the rector">—Quite right! said the rector. </said></p>
		<p>Stephen swallowed down the thing again  and tried to keep 
			his legs and his voice from shaking. </p>
		<p><said who="Stephen">—But, sir ... </said></p>
		<p><said who="the rector">—Yes? </said></p>
		<p><said who="Stephen">—Father Dolan came in today and pandied me because I 
				was not writing my theme. </said></p>
		<p>The rector looked at him in silence and he could feel the 
			blood rising to his face and the tears about to rise to his eyes. </p>
		<p>The rector said: </p>
		<p><said who="the rector">—Your name is Dedalus, isn't it? </said></p>
		<p><said who="Stephen">—Yes, sir. </said></p>
		<p><said who="the rector">—And where did you break your glasses? </said></p>
		<p><said who="Stephen">—On the cinderpath, sir. A fellow was coming out of the 
			bicycle house and I fell and they got broken. I don't know the 
			fellow's name. </said></p>
		<p>The rector looked at him again in silence. Then he smiled 
			and said: </p>
		<p><said who="the rector">—O, well, it was a mistake; I am sure Father Dolan did not 
				know. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Stephen">—But I told him I broke them, sir, and he pandied me. </said></p>
		<p><said who="the rector">—Did you tell him that you had written home for a new 
				pair? the rector asked. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Stephen">—No, sir. </said></p>
		<p><said who="the rector">—O well then, said the rector, Father Dolan did not understand. 
			You can say that I excuse you from your lessons for a 
			few days. </said></p>
		<p>Stephen said quickly for fear his trembling would prevent 
			him: </p>
		<p><said who="Stephen">—Yes, sir, but Father Dolan said he will come in tomorrow 
				to pandy me again for it. </said></p>
		<p><said who="the rector">—Very well, the rector said, it is a mistake and I shall 
				speak to Father Dolan myself. Will that do now? </said></p>
		<p>Stephen felt the tears wetting his eyes and murmured: </p>
		<p><said who="Stephen">—O yes sir, thanks. </said></p>
		<p>The rector held his hand across the side of the desk where 
			the skull was and Stephen, placing his hand in it for a moment, 
			felt a cool moist palm. </p>
		<p><said who="the rector">—Good day now, said the rector, withdrawing his hand and 
				bowing. </said></p>
		<p><said who="Stephen">—Good day, sir, said Stephen. </said></p>
		<p>He bowed and walked quietly out of the room, closing the 
			doors carefully and slowly. </p>
		<p>But when he had passed the old servant on the landing and 
			was again in the low narrow dark corridor he began to walk 
			faster and faster. Faster and faster he hurried on through the 
			gloom excitedly. He bumped his elbow against the door at the 
			end and, hurrying down the staircase, walked quickly through 
			the two corridors and out into the air. </p>
		<p>He could hear the cries of the fellows on the playgrounds. 
			He broke into a run and, running quicker and quicker, ran 
			across the cinderpath and reached the third line playground, 
			panting. </p>
		<p>The fellows had seen him running. They closed round him 
			in a ring, pushing one against another to hear. </p>
		<p><said who="the fellows">—Tell us! Tell us! </said></p>
		<p><said who="the fellows">—What did he say? </said></p>
		<p><said who="the fellows">—Did you go in? </said></p>
		<p><said who="the fellows">—What did he say? </said></p>
		<p><said who="the fellows">—Tell us! Tell us! </said></p>
		<p>He told them what he had said and what the rector had said 
			and, when he had told them, all the fellows flung their caps 
			spinning up into the air and cried: </p>
		<p><said who="the fellows">—Hurroo! </said></p>
		<p>They caught their caps and sent them up again spinning 
			skyhigh and cried again: </p>
		<p><said who="the fellows">—Hurroo! Hurroo! </said></p>
		<p>They made a cradle of their locked hands and hoisted him 
			up among them and carried him along till he struggled to get 
			free. And when he had escaped from them they broke away in 
			all directions, flinging their caps again into the air and whistling 
			as they went spinning up and crying: </p>
		<p><said who="the fellows">—Hurroo! </said></p>
		<p>And they gave three groans for Baldyhead Dolan and three 
			cheers for Conmee and they said he was the decentest rector 
			that was ever in Clongowes. </p>
		<p>The cheers died away in the soft grey air. He was alone. He 
			was happy and free: but he would not be anyway proud with 
			Father Dolan. He would be very quiet and obedient: and he 
			wished that he could do something kind for him to show him 
			that he was not proud. </p>
		<p>The air was soft and grey and mild and evening was coming. 
			There was the smell of evening in the air, the smell of the 
			fields in the country where they digged up turnips to peel them 
			and eat them when they went out for a walk to Major Barton's, 
			the smell there was in the little wood beyond the pavilion 
			where the gallnuts were. </p>
		<p>The fellows were practising long shies and bowing lobs and 
			slow twisters. In the soft grey silence he could hear the bump 
			of the balls: and from here and from there through the quiet 
			air the sound of the cricket bats: pick, pack, pock, puck: like 
			drops of water in a fountain falling softly in the brimming 
			bowl. </p>

		<p>Uncle Charles smoked such black twist that at last his 
			nephew suggested to him to enjoy his morning smoke in 
			a little outhouse at the end of the garden. </p>
		<p>—Very good, Simon. All serene, Simon, said the old man 
			tranquilly. Anywhere you like. The outhouse will do me 
			nicely: it will be more salubrious. </p>
		<p>—Damn me, said Mr Dedalus frankly, if I know how you 
			can smoke such villainous awful tobacco. It's like gunpowder, 
			by God. </p>
		<p>—It's very nice, Simon, replied the old man. Very cool and 
			mollifying. </p>
		<p>Every morning, therefore, uncle Charles repaired to his 
			outhouse but not before he had creased and brushed scrupulously 
			his back hair and brushed and put on his tall hat. While 
			he smoked the brim of his tall hat and the bowl of his pipe 
			were just visible beyond the jambs of the outhouse door. His 
			arbour, as he called the reeking outhouse which he shared 
			with the cat and the garden tools, served him also as a soundingbox: 
			and every morning he hummed contentedly one of his 
			favourite songs: <hi rend="italic">O, twine me a bower</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Blue eyes and golden
				hair</hi> or <hi rend="italic">The Groves of Blarney</hi> while the grey and blue coils of 
			smoke rose slowly from his pipe and vanished in the pure air. </p>
		<p>During the first part of the summer in Blackrock uncle 
			Charles was Stephen's constant companion. Uncle Charles 
			was a hale old man with a welltanned skin, rugged features 
			and white side whiskers. On week days he did messages between 
			the house in Carysfort Avenue and those shops in the 
			main street of the town with which the family dealt. Stephen 
			was glad to go with him on these errands for uncle Charles 
			helped him very liberally to handfuls of whatever was exposed 
			in open boxes and barrels outside the counter. He 
			would seize a handful of grapes and sawdust or three or four 
			American apples and thrust them generously into his grandnephew's 
			hand while the shopman smiled uneasily; and, on 
			Stephen's feigning reluctance to take them, he would frown 
			and say: </p>
		<p>—Take them, sir. Do you hear me, sir? They're good for 
			your bowels. </p>
		<p>When the order list had been booked the two would go on 
			to the park where an old friend of Stephen's father, Mike 
			Flynn, would be found seated on a bench, waiting for them. 
			Then would begin Stephen's run round the park. Mike Flynn 
			would stand at the gate near the railway station, watch in 
			hand, while Stephen ran round the track in the style Mike 
			Flynn favoured, his head high lifted, his knees well lifted and 
			his hands held straight down by his sides. When the morning 
			practice was over the trainer would make his comments and 
			sometimes illustrate them by shuffling along for a yard or so 
			comically in an old pair of blue canvas shoes. A small ring of 
			wonderstruck children and nursemaids would gather to watch 
			him and linger even when he and uncle Charles had sat down 
			again and were talking athletics and politics. Though he had 
			heard his father say that Mike Flynn had put some of the best 
			runners of modern times through his hands Stephen often 
			glanced with mistrust at his trainer's flabby stubblecovered 
			face, as it bent over the long stained fingers through which he 
			rolled his cigarette, and with pity at the mild lustreless blue 
			eyes which would look up suddenly from the task and gaze 
			vaguely into the blue distance while the long swollen fingers 
			ceased their rolling and grains and fibres of tobacco fell back 
			into the pouch. </p>
		<p>On the way home uncle Charles would often pay a visit to 
			the chapel and, as the font was above Stephen's reach, the old 
			man would dip his hand and then sprinkle the water briskly 
			about Stephen's clothes and on the floor of the porch. While 
			he prayed he knelt on his red handkerchief and read above his 
			breath from a thumbblackened prayerbook wherein catchwords 
			were printed at the foot of every page. Stephen knelt at 
			his side respecting, though he did not share, his piety. He 
			often wondered what his granduncle prayed for so seriously. 
			Perhaps he prayed for the souls in purgatory or for the grace 
			of a happy death or perhaps he prayed that God might send 
			him back a part of the big fortune he had squandered in Cork. </p>
		<p>On Sundays Stephen with his father and his granduncle 
			took their constitutional. The old man was a nimble walker in 
			spite of his corns and often ten or twelve miles of the road 
			were covered. The little village of Stillorgan was the parting of 
			the ways. Either they went to the left towards the Dublin 
			mountains or along the Goatstown road and thence into 
			Dundrum, coming home by Sandyford. Trudging along the 
			road or standing in some grimy wayside publichouse his elders 
			spoke constantly of the subjects nearer their hearts, of Irish 
			politics, of Munster and of the legends of their own family, to 
			all of which Stephen lent an avid ear. Words which he did not 
			understand he said over and over to himself till he had learned 
			them by heart: and through them he had glimpses of the real 
			world about him. The hour when he too would take part in the 
			life of that world seemed drawing near and in secret he began 
			to make ready for the great part which he felt awaited him the 
			nature of which he only dimly apprehended. </p>
		<p>His evenings were his own; and he pored over a ragged 
			translation of <hi rend="italic">The Count of Monte Cristo</hi>. The figure of that 
			dark avenger stood forth in his mind for whatever he had 
			heard or divined in childhood of the strange and terrible. At 
			night he built up on the parlour table an image of the wonderful 
			island cave out of transfers and paper flowers and coloured 
			tissue paper and strips of the silver and golden paper in which 
			chocolate is wrapped. When he had broken up this scenery, 
			weary of its tinsel, there would come to his mind the bright 
			picture of Marseilles, of sunny trellisses and of Mercedes. 
			Outside Blackrock, on the road that led to the mountains, 
			stood a small whitewashed house in the garden of which grew 
			many rosebushes: and in this house, he told himself, another 
			Mercedes lived. Both on the outward and on the homeward 
			journey he measured distance by this landmark: and in his 
			imagination he lived through a long train of adventures, marvellous 
			as those in the book itself, towards the close of which 
			there appeared an image of himself, grown older and sadder, 
			standing in a moonlit garden with Mercedes who had so many 
			years before slighted his love, and with a sadly proud gesture 
			of refusal, saying: </p>
		<p>—Madam, I never eat muscatel grapes. </p>
		<p>He became the ally of a boy named Aubrey Mills and 
			founded with him a gang of adventurers in the avenue. Aubrey 
			carried a whistle dangling from his buttonhole and a bicycle 
			lamp attached to his belt while the others had short sticks 
			thrust daggerwise through theirs. Stephen, who had read of 
			Napoleon's plain style of dress, chose to remain unadorned 
			and thereby heightened for himself the pleasure of taking 
			counsel with his lieutenant before giving orders. The gang 
			made forays into the gardens of old maids or went down to the 
			castle and fought a battle on the shaggy weedgrown rocks, 
			coming home after it weary stragglers with the stale odours of 
			the foreshore in their nostrils and the rank oils of the seawrack 
			upon their hands and in their hair. </p>
		<p>Aubrey and Stephen had a common milkman and often 
			they drove out in the milkcar to Carrickmines where the cows 
			were at grass. While the men were milking the boys would 
			take turns in riding the tractable mare round the field. But 
			when autumn came the cows were driven home from the 
			grass: and the first sight of the filthy cowyard at Stradbrook 
			with its foul green puddles and clots of liquid dung and steaming 
			brantroughs sickened Stephen's heart. The cattle which 
			had seemed so beautiful in the country on sunny days revolted 
			him and he could not even look at the milk they yielded. </p>
		<p>The coming of September did not trouble him this year for 
			he was not to be sent back to Clongowes. The practice in the 
			park came to an end when Mike Flynn went into hospital. 
			Aubrey was at school and had only an hour or two free in the 
			evening. The gang fell asunder and there were no more nightly 
			forays or battles on the rocks. Stephen sometimes went round 
			with the car which delivered the evening milk: and these chilly 
			drives blew away his memory of the filth of the cowyard and 
			he felt no repugnance at seeing the cowhairs and hayseeds on 
			the milkman's coat. Whenever the car drew up before a house 
			he waited to catch a glimpse of a wellscrubbed kitchen or of a 
			softlylighted hall and to see how the servant would hold the 
			jug and how she would close the door. He thought it should be 
			a pleasant life enough, driving along the roads every evening 
			to deliver milk, if he had warm gloves and a fat bag of gingernuts 
			in his pocket to eat from. But the same foreknowledge 
			which had sickened his heart and made his legs sag suddenly 
			as he raced round the park, the same intuition which had 
			made him glance with mistrust at his trainer's flabby stubblecovered 
			face as it bent heavily over his long stained fingers, 
			dissipated any vision of the future. In a vague way he understood 
			that his father was in trouble and that this was the 
			reason why he himself had not been sent back to Clongowes. 
			For some time he had felt the slight changes in his house; and 
			these changes in what he had deemed unchangeable were so 
			many slight shocks to his boyish conception of the world. The 
			ambition which he felt astir at times in the darkness of his soul 
			sought no outlet. A dusk like that of the outer world obscured 
			his mind as he heard the mare's hoofs clattering along the 
			tramtrack on the Rock Road and the great can swaying and 
			rattling behind him. </p>
		<p>He returned to Mercedes and, as he brooded upon her 
			image, a strange unrest crept into his blood. Sometimes a fever 
			gathered within him and led him to rove alone in the evening 
			along the quiet avenue. The peace of the gardens and the 
			kindly lights in the windows poured a tender influence into his 
			restless heart. The noise of children at play annoyed him and 
			their silly voices made him feel, even more keenly than he had 
			felt at Clongowes, that he was different from others. He did 
			not want to play. He wanted to meet in the real world the 
			unsubstantial image which his soul so constantly beheld. He 
			did not know where to seek it or how: but a premonition 
			which led him on told him that this image would, without any 
			overt act of his, encounter him. They would meet quietly as if 
			they had known each other and had made their tryst, perhaps 
			at one of the gates or in some more secret place. They would 
			be alone, surrounded by darkness and silence: and in that 
			moment of supreme tenderness he would be transfigured. He 
			would fade into something impalpable under her eyes and 
			then in a moment, he would be transfigured. Weakness and 
			timidity and inexperience would fall from him in that magic 
			moment. </p>

	<div n="2.2" type="section"> 

		<p>Two great yellow caravans had halted one morning before 
			the door and men had come tramping into the house to 
			dismantle it. The furniture had been hustled out through the 
			front garden which was strewn with wisps of straw and rope 
			ends and into the huge vans at the gate. When all had been 
			safely stowed the vans had set off noisily down the avenue: 
			and from the window of the railway carriage, in which he had 
			sat with his redeyed mother, Stephen had seen them lumbering 
			heavily along the Merrion Road. </p>
		<p>The parlour fire would not draw that evening and Mr Dedalus 
			rested the poker against the bars of the grate to attract 
			the flame. Uncle Charles dozed in a corner of the half furnished 
			uncarpeted room and near him the family portraits 
			leaned against the wall. The lamp on the table shed a weak 
			light over the boarded floor, muddied by the feet of the vanmen. 
			Stephen sat on a footstool beside his father listening to a 
			long and incoherent monologue. He understood little or 
			nothing of it at first but he became slowly aware that his father 
			had enemies and that some fight was going to take place. He 
			felt too that he was being enlisted for the fight, that some duty 
			was being laid upon his shoulders. The sudden flight from the 
			comfort and revery of Blackrock, the passage through the 
			gloomy foggy city, the thought of the bare cheerless house in 
			which they were now to live made his heart heavy: and again 
			an intuition or foreknowledge of the future came to him. He 
			understood also why the servants had often whispered together 
			in the hall and why his father had often stood on the 
			hearthrug, with his back to the fire, talking loudly to uncle 
			Charles who urged him to sit down and eat his dinner. </p>
		<p>—There's a crack of the whip left in me yet, Stephen, old 
			chap, said Mr Dedalus, poking at the dull fire with fierce 
			energy. We're not dead yet, sonny. No, by the Lord Jesus 
			(God forgive me) nor half dead. </p>
		<p>Dublin was a new and complex sensation. Uncle Charles 
			had grown so witless that he could no longer be sent out on 
			errands and the disorder in settling in the new house left 
			Stephen freer than he had been in Blackrock. In the beginning 
			he contented himself with circling timidly round the neighbouring 
			square or, at most, going half way down one of the 
			side streets: but when he had made a skeleton map of the city 
			in his mind he followed boldly one of its central lines until he 
			reached the customhouse. He passed unchallenged among the 
			docks and along the quays wondering at the multitude of 
			corks that lay bobbing on the surface of the water in a thick 
			yellow scum, at the crowds of quay porters and the rumbling 
			carts and the illdressed bearded policeman. The vastness and 
			strangeness of the life suggested to him by the bales of merchandise 
			stocked along the walls or swung aloft out of the 
			holds of steamers wakened again in him the unrest which had 
			sent him wandering in the evening from garden to garden in 
			search of Mercedes. And amid this new bustling life he might 
			have fancied himself in another Marseilles but that he missed 
			the bright sky and the sunwarmed trellisses of the wineshops. 
			A vague dissatisfaction grew up within him as he looked on the 
			quays and on the river and on the lowering skies and yet he 
			continued to wander up and down day after day as if he really 
			sought someone that eluded him. </p>
		<p>He went once or twice with his mother to visit their relatives: 
			and, though they passed a jovial array of shops lit up 
			and adorned for Christmas, his mood of embittered silence did 
			not leave him. The causes of his embitterment were many, 
			remote and near. He was angry with himself for being young 
			and the prey of restless foolish impulses, angry also with the 
			change of fortune which was reshaping the world about him 
			into a vision of squalor and insincerity. Yet his anger lent 
			nothing to the vision. He chronicled with patience what he 
			saw, detaching himself from it and testing its mortifying 
			flavour in secret. </p>
		<p>He was sitting on the backless chair in his aunt's kitchen. A 
			lamp with a reflector hung on the japanned wall of the fireplace 
			and by its light his aunt was reading the evening paper 
			that lay on her knees. She looked a long time at a smiling 
			picture that was set in it and said musingly: </p>
		<p>—The beautiful Mabel Hunter! </p>
		<p>A ringletted girl stood on tiptoe to peer at the picture and 
			said softly: </p>
		<p>—What is she in, mud? </p>
		<p>—In the pantomime, love. </p>
		<p>The child leaned her ringletted head against her mother's 
			sleeve, gazing on the picture, and murmured as if fascinated: </p>
		<p>—The beautiful Mabel Hunter! </p>
		<p>As if fascinated, her eyes rested long upon those demurely 
			taunting eyes and she murmured again devotedly: </p>
		<p>—Isn't she an exquisite creature? </p>
		<p>And the boy who came in from the street, stamping 
			crookedly under his stone of coal, heard her words. He 
			dropped his load promptly on the floor and hurried to her side 
			to see. But she did not raise her easeful head to let him see. He 
			mauled the edges of the paper with his reddened and blackened 
			hands, shouldering her aside and complaining that he 
			could not see. </p>
		<p>He was sitting in the narrow breakfast room high up in the 
			old darkwindowed house. The firelight flickered on the wall 
			and beyond the window a spectral dusk was gathering upon 
			the river. Before the fire an old woman was busy making tea 
			and, as she bustled at her task, she told in a low voice of what 
			the priest and the doctor had said. She told too of certain 
			changes she had seen in her of late and of her odd ways and 
			sayings. He sat listening to the words and following the ways 
			of adventure that lay open in the coals, arches and vaults and 
			winding galleries and jagged caverns. </p>
		<p>Suddenly he became aware of something in the doorway. A 
			skull appeared suspended in the gloom of the doorway. A 
			feeble creature like a monkey was there, drawn thither by the 
			sound of voices at the fire. A whining voice came from the 
			door, asking: </p>
		<p>—Is that Josephine? </p>
		<p>The old bustling woman answered cheerily from the fireplace: </p>
		<p>—No, Ellen. It's Stephen. </p>
		<p>—O ... O, good evening, Stephen. </p>
		<p>He answered the greeting and saw a silly smile break over 
			the face in the doorway. </p>
		<p>—Do you want anything, Ellen? asked the old woman at 
			the fire. </p>
		<p>But she did not answer the question and said: </p>
		<p>—I thought it was Josephine. I thought you were Josephine, 
			Stephen. </p>
		<p>And, repeating this several times, she fell to laughing feebly. </p>
		<p>He was sitting in the midst of a children's party at Harold's 
			Cross. His silent watchful manner had grown upon him and he 
			took little part in the games. The children, wearing the spoils 
			of their crackers, danced and romped noisily and, though he 
			tried to share their merriment, he felt himself a gloomy figure 
			amid the gay cocked hats and sunbonnets. </p>
		<p>But when he had sung his song and withdrawn into a snug 
			corner of the room he began to taste the joy of his loneliness. 
			The mirth, which in the beginning of the evening had seemed 
			to him false and trivial, was like a soothing air to him, passing 
			gaily by his senses, hiding from other eyes the feverish agitation 
			of his blood while through the circling of the dancers and 
			amid the music and laughter her glance travelled to his corner, 
			flattering, taunting, searching, exciting his heart. </p>
		<p>In the hall the children who had stayed latest were putting 
			on their things: the party was over. She had thrown a shawl 
			about her and, as they went together towards the tram, sprays 
			of her fresh warm breath flew gaily above her cowled head 
			and her shoes tapped blithely on the glassy road. </p>
		<p>It was the last tram. The lank brown horses knew it and 
			shook their bells to the clear night in admonition. The conductor 
			talked with the driver, both nodding often in the green 
			light of the lamp. On the empty seats of the tram were scattered 
			a few coloured tickets. No sound of footsteps came up 
			or down the road. No sound broke the peace of the night save 
			when the lank brown horses rubbed their noses together and 
			shook their bells. </p>
		<p>They seemed to listen, he on the upper step and she on the 
			lower. She came up to his step many times and went down to 
			hers again between their phrases and once or twice stood close 
			beside him for some moments on the upper step, forgetting to 
			go down, and then went down. His heart danced upon her 
			movements like a cork upon a tide. He heard what her eyes 
			said to him from beneath their cowl and knew that in some 
			dim past, whether in life or in revery, he had heard their tale 
			before. He saw her urge her vanities, her fine dress and sash 
			and long black stockings, and knew that he had yielded to 
			them a thousand times. Yet a voice within him spoke above 
			the noise of his dancing heart, asking him would he take her 
			gift to which he had only to stretch out his hand. And he 
			remembered the day when he and Eileen had stood looking 
			into the hotel grounds, watching the waiters running up a trail 
			of bunting on the flagstaff and the fox terrier scampering to 
			and fro on the sunny lawn, and how, all of a sudden, she had 
			broken out into a peal of laughter and had run down the 
			sloping curve of the path. Now, as then, he stood listlessly in 
			his place, seemingly a tranquil watcher of the scene before 
			him. </p>
		<p>—She too wants me to catch hold of her, he thought. That's 
			why she came with me to the tram. I could easily catch hold of 
			her when she comes up to my step: nobody is looking. I could 
			hold her and kiss her. </p>
		<p>But he did neither: and, when he was sitting alone in the 
			deserted tram, he tore his ticket into shreds and stared 
			gloomily at the corrugated footboard. </p>
		<p>The next day he sat at his table in the bare upper room for 
			many hours. Before him lay a new pen, a new bottle of ink 
			and a new emerald exercise. From force of habit he had 
			written at the top of the first page the initial letters of the jesuit 
			motto: A. M. D. G. On the first line of the page appeared the 
			title of the verses he was trying to write: To E— C—. 
			He knew it was right to begin so for he had seen similar titles 
			in the collected poems of Lord Byron. When he had written 
			this title and drawn an ornamental line underneath he fell into 
			a daydream and began to draw diagrams on the cover of the 
			book. He saw himself sitting at his table in Bray the morning 
			after the discussion at the Christmas dinnertable, trying to 
			write a poem about Parnell on the back of one of his father's 
			second moiety notices. But his brain had then refused to 
			grapple with the theme and, desisting, he had covered the 
			page with the names and addresses of certain of his classmates: </p>
		<p>Roderick Kickham </p>
		<p>John Lawton </p>
		<p>Anthony MacSwiney </p>
		<p>Simon Moonan </p>
		<p>Now it seemed as if he would fail again but, by dint of 
			brooding on the incident, he thought himself into confidence. 
			During this process all these elements which he deemed common 
			and insignificant fell out of the scene. There remained no 
			trace of the tram itself nor of the trammen nor of the horses: 
			nor did he and she appear vividly. The verses told only of the 
			night and the balmy breeze and the maiden lustre of the moon. 
			Some undefined sorrow was hidden in the hearts of the protagonists 
			as they stood in silence beneath the leafless trees and 
			when the moment of farewell had come the kiss, which had 
			been withheld by one, was given by both. After this the letters 
			L. D. S. were written at the foot of the page and, having hidden 
			the book, he went into his mother's bedroom and gazed at his 
			face for a long time in the mirror of her dressingtable. </p>
		<p>But his long spell of leisure and liberty was drawing to its 
			end. One evening his father came home full of news which 
			kept his tongue busy all through dinner. Stephen had been 
			awaiting his father's return for there had been mutton hash 
			that day and he knew that his father would make him dip his 
			bread in the gravy. But he did not relish the hash for the 
			mention of Clongowes had coated his palate with a scum of 
			disgust. </p>
		<p>—I walked bang into him, said Mr Dedalus for the fourth 
			time, just at the corner of the square. </p>
		<p>—Then I suppose, said Mrs Dedalus, he will be able to 
			arrange it. I mean about Belvedere. </p>
		<p>—Of course  he will, said Mr Dedalus. Don't I tell you he's 
			provincial of the order now? </p>
		<p>—I never liked the idea of sending him to the christian 
			brothers myself, said Mrs Dedalus. </p>
		<p>—Christian brothers be damned! said Mr Dedalus. Is it 
			with Paddy Stink and Mickey Mud? No, let him stick to the 
			jesuits in God's name since he began with them. They'll be of 
			service to him in after years. Those are the fellows that can get 
			you a position. </p>
		<p>—And they're a very rich order, aren't they, Simon? </p>
		<p>—Rather. They live well, I tell you. You saw their table at 
			Clongowes. Fed up, by God, like gamecocks. </p>
		<p>Mr Dedalus pushed his plate over to Stephen and bade him 
			finish what was on it. </p>
		<p>—Now then, Stephen, he said, you must put your shoulder 
			to the wheel, old chap. You've had a fine long holiday. </p>
		<p>—O, I'm sure  he'll work very hard now, said Mrs Dedalus, 
			especially when he has Maurice with him. </p>
		<p>—O, Holy Paul, I forgot about Maurice, said Mr Dedalus. 
			Here, Maurice! Come here, you thickheaded ruffian! Do you 
			know I'm going to send you to a college where they'll teach 
			you to spell c.a.t. cat. And I'll buy you a nice little penny 
			handkerchief to keep your nose dry. Won't that be grand fun? </p>
		<p>Maurice grinned at his father and then at his brother. Mr 
			Dedalus screwed his glass into his eye and stared hard at both 
			his sons. Stephen mumbled his bread without answering his 
			father's gaze. </p>
		<p>—By the bye, said Mr Dedalus at length, the rector, or 
			provincial, rather, was telling me that story about you and 
			Father Dolan. You're an impudent thief, he said. </p>
		<p>—O, he didn't, Simon! </p>
		<p>—Not he! said Mr Dedalus. But he gave me a great account 
			of the whole affair. We were chatting, you know, and one 
			word borrowed another. And, by the way, who do you think 
			he told me will get that job in the corporation? But I'll tell you 
			that after. Well, as I was saying, we were chatting away quite 
			friendly and he asked me did our friend here wear glasses still 
			and then he told me the whole story. </p>
		<p>—And was he annoyed, Simon? </p>
		<p>—Annoyed! Not he! <hi rend="italic">Manly little chap!</hi> he said. </p>
		<p>Mr Dedalus imitated the mincing nasal tone of the provincial. </p>
		<p>—Father Dolan and I, when I told them all at dinner about 
			it, Father Dolan and I had a great laugh over it. <hi rend="italic">You better
				mind yourself, Father Dolan</hi>, said I, <hi rend="italic">or young Dedalus will 
				send you up for twice nine</hi>. We had a famous laugh together 
			over it. Ha! Ha! Ha!</p>
		<p>Mr Dedalus turned to his wife and interjected in his natural 
			voice: </p>
		<p>—Shows you the spirit in which they take the boys there. 
			O, a jesuit for your life, for diplomacy! </p>
		<p>He reassumed the provincial's voice and repeated: </p>
		<p>—<hi rend="italic">I told them all at dinner about it and Father Dolan and I
				and all of us we had a hearty laugh together over it. Ha! Ha! Ha!</hi></p>

	<div n="2.3" type="section"> 

		<p>The night of the Whitsuntide play had come and Stephen 
			from the window of the dressingroom looked out on  the small 
			grassplot across which lines of Chinese lanterns were 
			stretched. He watched the visitors come down the steps from 
			the house and pass into the theatre. Stewards in evening dress, 
			old Belvedereans, loitered in groups about the entrance to the 
			theatre and ushered in the visitors with ceremony. Under the 
			sudden glow of a lantern he could recognise the smiling face of 
			a priest. </p>
		<p>The Blessed Sacrament had been removed from the tabernacle 
			and the first benches had been driven so as to leave 
			the dais of the altar and the space before it free. Against 
			the walls stood companies of barbells and Indian clubs; the 
			dumbbells were piled in one corner: and in the midst of countless 
			hillocks of gymnasium shoes and sweaters and singlets in 
			untidy brown parcels there stood the stout leatherjacketed 
			vaulting horse waiting its turn to be carried up on the stage. A 
			large bronze shield, tipped with silver, leaned against the panel 
			of the altar also waiting its turn to be carried up on the stage 
			and set in the middle of the winning team at the end of the 
			gymnastic  display. </p>
		<p>Stephen, though in deference to his reputation for essay-writing 
			he had been elected secretary to the gymnasium, had 
			had no part in the first section of the programme but in the 
			play which formed the second section he had the chief part, 
			that of a farcical  pedagogue. He had been cast for it on account 
			of his stature and grave manners for he was now at the 
			end of his second year at Belvedere and in number two. </p>
		<p>A score of the younger boys in white knickers and singlets 
			came pattering down from the stage, through the vestry and 
			into the chapel. The vestry and chapel were peopled with 
			eager masters and boys. The plump bald sergeantmajor was 
			testing with his foot the springboard of the vaulting horse. The 
			lean young man in a long overcoat, who was to give a special 
			display of intricate club swinging, stood near watching with 
			interest, his silvercoated clubs peeping out of his deep sidepockets. 
			The hollow rattle of the wooden dumbbells was 
			heard as another team made ready to go up on the stage: and 
			in another moment the excited prefect was hustling the boys 
			through the vestry like a flock of geese, flapping the wings of 
			his soutane nervously and crying to the laggards to make 
			haste. A little troop  of Neapolitan peasants were practising 
			their steps at the end of the chapel, some circling their arms 
			above their heads, some swaying their baskets of paper violets 
			and curtseying. In a dark corner of the chapel at the gospel 
			side of the altar a stout old lady knelt amid her copious black 
			skirts. When she stood up a pinkdressed figure, wearing a 
			curly golden wig and an oldfashioned straw sunbonnet, with 
			black pencilled eyebrows and cheeks delicately rouged and 
			powdered, was discovered. A low murmur of curiosity ran 
			round the chapel at the discovery of this girlish figure. One of 
			the prefects, smiling and nodding his head, approached the 
			dark corner and, having bowed to the stout old lady, said 
			pleasantly: </p>
		<p>—Is this a beautiful young lady or a doll that you have 
			here, Mrs Tallon? </p>
		<p>Then, bending down to peer at the smiling painted face 
			under the leaf of the bonnet, he exclaimed: </p>
		<p>—No! Upon my word I believe it's little Bertie Tallon after 
			all! </p>
		<p>Stephen at his post by the window heard the old lady and 
			the priest laugh together and heard the boys' murmur of 
			admiration behind him as they passed forward to see the little 
			boy who had to dance the sunbonnet dance by himself. A 
			movement of impatience escaped him. He let the edge of the 
			blind fall and, stepping down from the bench on which he had 
			been standing, walked out of the chapel. </p>
		<p>He passed out of the schoolhouse and halted under the shed 
			that flanked the garden. From the theatre opposite came the 
			muffled noise of the audience and sudden brazen clashes of 
			the soldiers' band. The light spread upwards from the glass 
			roof making the theatre seem a festive ark, anchored among 
			the hulks of houses, her frail cables of lanterns looping her to 
			her moorings. A sidedoor of the theatre opened suddenly and 
			a shaft of light flew across the grassplots. A sudden burst of 
			music issued from the ark, the prelude of a waltz: and when 
			the sidedoor closed again the listener could hear the faint 
			rhythm of the music. The sentiment of the opening bars, their 
			languor and supple movement, evoked the incommunicable 
			emotion which had been the cause of all his day's unrest and 
			of his impatient movement of a moment before. His unrest 
			issued from him like a wave of sound: and on the tide of flowing 
			music the ark was journeying, trailing her cables of lanterns 
			in her wake. Then a noise like dwarf artillery broke the 
			movement. It was the clapping that greeted the entry of the 
			dumbbell team on the stage. </p>
		<p>At the far end of the shed near the street a speck of pink 
			light showed in the darkness and as he walked towards it he 
			became aware of a faint aromatic odour. Two boys were 
			standing in the shelter of a doorway, smoking, and before he 
			reached them he had recognised Heron by his voice. </p>
		<p>—Here comes the noble Dedalus! cried a high throaty 
			voice. Welcome to our trusty friend! </p>
		<p>This welcome ended in a soft peal of mirthless laughter as 
			Heron salaamed and then began to poke the ground with his 
			cane. </p>
		<p>—Here I am, said Stephen, halting and glancing from 
			Heron to his friend. </p>
		<p>The latter was a stranger to him but in the darkness, by the 
			aid of the glowing cigarettetips, he could make out a pale 
			dandyish face, over which a smile was travelling slowly, a tall 
			overcoated figure and a hard hat. Heron did not trouble himself 
			about an introduction but said instead: </p>
		<p>—I was just telling my friend Wallis what a lark it would be 
			tonight if you took off the rector in the part of the schoolmaster. 
			It would be a ripping good joke. </p>
		<p>Heron made a poor attempt to imitate for his friend Wallis 
			the rector's pedantic bass and then, laughing at his failure, 
			asked Stephen to do it. </p>
		<p>—Go on, Dedalus, he urged, you can take him off rippingly. 
			<i>He that will not hear the churcha let him be to theea as</i> 
			<i>the heathena and the publicana.</i> </p>
		<p>The imitation was prevented by a mild expression of anger 
			from Wallis in whose mouthpiece the cigarette had become 
			too tightly wedged. </p>
		<p>—Damn this blankety blank holder, he said, taking it from 
			his mouth and smiling and frowning upon it tolerantly. It's 
			always getting stuck like that. Do you use a holder? </p>
		<p>—I don't smoke, answered Stephen. </p>
		<p>—No, said Heron, Dedalus is a model youth. He doesn't 
			smoke and he doesn't go to bazaars and he doesn't flirt and he 
			doesn't damn anything or damn all. </p>
		<p>Stephen shook his head and smiled in his rival's flushed and 
			mobile face, beaked like a bird's. He had often thought it 
			strange that Vincent Heron had a bird's face as well as a bird's 
			name. A shock of pale hair lay on the forehead like a ruffled 
			crest: the forehead was narrow and bony and a thin hooked 
			nose stood out between the closeset prominent eyes which were 
			light and inexpressive. The rivals were school friends. They 
			sat together in class, knelt together in the chapel, talked together 
			after beads over their lunches. As the fellows in number 
			one were undistinguished dullards Stephen and Heron had 
			been during the year the virtual heads of the school. It was 
			they who went up to the rector together to ask for a free day 
			or to get a fellow off. </p>
		<p>—O by the way, said Heron suddenly, I saw your governor 
			going in. </p>
		<p>The smile waned on Stephen's face. Any allusion made to 
			his father by a fellow or by a master put his calm to rout in a 
			moment. He waited in timorous silence to hear what Heron 
			might say next. Heron, however, nudged him expressively 
			with his elbow and said: </p>
		<p>—You're a sly dog, Dedalus! </p>
		<p>—Why so? said Stephen. </p>
		<p>—You'd think butter wouldn't melt in your mouth, said 
			Heron. But I'm afraid you're a sly dog. </p>
		<p>—Might I ask you what you are talking about? said 
			Stephen urbanely. </p>
		<p>—Indeed you might, answered Heron. We saw her, Wallis, 
			didn't we? And deucedly pretty she is too. And so inquisitive! 
			<i>And what part does Stephen take, Mr Dedalus? And will</i> 
			<i>Stephen not sing, Mr Dedalus?</i> Your governor was staring at 
			her through that eyeglass of his for all he was worth so that I 
			think the old man has found you out too. I wouldn't care a 
			bit, by Jove. She's  ripping, isn't she, Wallis? </p>
		<p>—Not half bad, answered Wallis quietly as he placed his 
			holder once more in the corner of his mouth. </p>
		<p>A shaft of momentary anger flew through Stephen's mind 
			at these indelicate allusions in the hearing of a stranger. For 
			him there was nothing amusing in a girl's interest and regard. 
			All day he had thought of nothing but their leavetaking on 
			the steps of the tram at Harold's Cross, the stream of moody 
			emotions it had made to course through him, and the poem 
			he had written about it. All day he had imagined a new meeting 
			with her for he knew that she was to come to the play. The 
			old restless moodiness had again filled his breast as it had 
			done on the night of the party but had not found  an outlet in 
			verse. The growth and knowledge of two years of boyhood 
			stood between then and now, forbidding such an outlet: and 
			all day the stream of gloomy tenderness within him had 
			started forth and returned upon itself in dark courses and 
			eddies, wearying him in the end until the pleasantry of the 
			prefect and the painted little boy had drawn from him a 
			movement of impatience. </p>
		<p>—So you may as well admit, Heron went on, that we've 
			fairly found you out this time. You can't play the saint on me 
			any more, that's one sure five. </p>
		<p>A soft peal of mirthless laughter escaped from his lips and, 
			bending down as before, he struck Stephen lightly across the 
			calf of the leg with his cane, as if in jesting reproof. </p>
		<p>Stephen's movement of anger had already passed. He was 
			neither flattered nor confused but simply wished the banter to 
			end. He scarcely resented what had seemed to him at first a 
			silly indelicateness for he knew that the adventure in his mind 
			stood in no danger from their words: and his face mirrored his 
			rival's false smile. </p>
		<p>—Admit! repeated Heron, striking him again with his cane 
			across the calf of the leg. </p>
		<p>The stroke was playful but not so lightly given as the first 
			one had been. Stephen felt the skin tingle and glow slightly 
			and almost painlessly; and bowing submissively, as if to meet 
			his companion's jesting mood, began to recite the <seg xml:lang="lat"><hi rend="italic">Confiteor</hi></seg>. 
			The episode ended well for both Heron and Wallis laughed 
			indulgently at the irreverence. </p>
		<p>The confession came only from Stephen's lips and, while 
			they spoke the words, a sudden memory had carried him to 
			another scene called up, as if by magic, at the moment when 
			he had noted the faint cruel dimples at the corners of Heron's 
			smiling lips and had felt the familiar stroke of the cane against 
			his calf and had heard the familiar word of admonition: </p>
		<p>—Admit. </p>
		<p>It was towards the close of his first term in the college when 
			he was in number six. His sensitive nature was still smarting 
			under the lashes of an undivined and squalid way of life. His 
			soul was still disquieted and cast down by the dull phenomenon 
			of Dublin. He had emerged from a two years' spell of 
			revery to find himself in the midst of a new scene, every event 
			and figure of which affected him intimately, disheartened him 
			or allured and, whether alluring or disheartening, filled him 
			always with unrest and bitter thoughts. All the leisure which 
			his school life left him was passed in the company of subversive 
			writers whose gibes and violence of speech set up a ferment 
			in his brain before they passed out of it into his crude 
			writings. </p>
		<p>The essay was for him the chief labour of his week and 
			every Tuesday, as he marched from home to the school, he 
			read his fate in the incidents of the way, pitting himself against 
			some figure ahead of him and quickening his pace to outstrip 
			it before a certain goal was reached or planting his steps 
			scrupulously in the spaces of the patchwork of the footpath 
			and telling himself that he would be first and not first in the 
			weekly essay. </p>
		<p>On a certain Tuesday the course of his triumphs was rudely 
			broken. Mr Tate, the English master, pointed his finger at him 
			and said bluntly: </p>
		<p>—This fellow has heresy in his essay. </p>
		<p>A hush fell on the class. Mr Tate did not break it but dug 
			with his hand between his crossed thighs while his heavily 
			starched linen creaked about his neck and wrists. Stephen did 
			not look up. It was a raw spring morning and his eyes were 
			still smarting and weak. He was conscious of failure and of 
			detection, of the squalor of his own mind and home, and felt 
			against his neck the raw edge of his turned and jagged collar. </p>
		<p>A short loud laugh from Mr Tate set the class more at ease. </p>
		<p>—Perhaps you didn't know that, he said. </p>
		<p>—Where? asked Stephen. </p>
		<p>Mr Tate withdrew his delving hand and spread out the 
			essay. </p>
		<p>—Here. It's about the Creator and the soul. Rrm ... rrm 
			... rrm ...  Ah! <hi rend="italic">without a possibility of ever approaching 
			nearer</hi>. That's heresy. </p>
		<p>Stephen murmured: </p>
		<p>—I meant <hi rend="italic">without a possibility of ever reaching</hi>. </p>
		<p>It was a submission and Mr Tate, appeased, folded up the 
			essay and passed it across to him, saying: </p>
		<p>—O ... Ah! <hi rend="italic">ever reaching</hi>. That's another story. </p>
		<p>But the class was not so soon appeased. Though nobody 
			spoke to him of the affair after class he could feel about him a 
			vague general malignant joy. </p>
		<p>A few nights after this public chiding  he was walking with a 
			letter along the Drumcondra Road when he heard a voice cry: </p>
		<p>—Halt! </p>
		<p>He turned and saw three boys of his own class coming 
			towards him in the dusk. It was Heron who had called out and, 
			as he marched forward between his two attendants, he cleft 
			the air before him with a thin cane, in time to their steps. 
			Boland, his friend, marched beside him, a large grin on his 
			face, while Nash came on a few steps behind, blowing from 
			the pace and wagging his great red head. </p>
		<p>As soon as the boys had turned into Clonliffe Road together 
			they began to speak about books and writers, saying what 
			books they were reading and how many books there were in 
			their fathers' bookcases at home. Stephen listened to them in 
			some wonderment for Boland was the dunce and Nash the 
			idler of the class. In fact after some talk about their favourite 
			writers Nash declared for Captain Marryat who, he said, was 
			the greatest writer. </p>
		<p>—Fudge! said Heron. Ask Dedalus. Who is the greatest 
			writer, Dedalus? </p>
		<p>Stephen noted the mockery in the question and said: </p>
		<p>—Of prose do you mean? </p>
		<p>—Yes. </p>
		<p>—Newman, I think. </p>
		<p>—Is it Cardinal Newman? asked Boland. </p>
		<p>—Yes, answered Stephen. </p>
		<p>The grin broadened on Nash's freckled face as he turned to 
			Stephen and said: </p>
		<p>—And do you like Cardinal Newman, Dedalus? </p>
		<p>—O, many say that Newman has the best prose style, 
			Heron said to the other two in explanation. Of course he's not 
			a poet. </p>
		<p>—And who is the best poet, Heron? asked Boland. </p>
		<p>—Lord Tennyson, of course, answered Heron. </p>
		<p>—O, yes, Lord Tennyson, said Nash. We have all his 
			poetry at home in a book. </p>
		<p>At this Stephen forgot the silent vows he had been making 
			and burst out: </p>
		<p>—Tennyson a poet! Why, he's only a rhymester! </p>
		<p>—O, get out! said Heron. Everyone knows that Tennyson 
			is the greatest poet. </p>
		<p>—And who do you think is the greatest poet? asked Boland, 
			nudging his neighbour. </p>
		<p>—Byron, of course, answered Stephen. </p>
		<p>Heron gave the lead and all three joined in a scornful laugh. </p>
		<p>—What are you laughing at? asked Stephen. </p>
		<p>—You, said Heron. Byron the greatest poet! He's only a 
			poet for uneducated people. </p>
		<p>—He must be a fine poet! said Boland. </p>
		<p>—You may keep your mouth shut, said Stephen, turning on 
			him boldly. All you know about poetry is what you wrote up 
			on the slates in the yard and were going to be sent to the loft 
			for. </p>
		<p>Boland, in fact, was said to have written on the slates in the 
			yard a couplet about a classmate of his who often rode home 
			from the college on a pony: </p>
		<lg>
			<l>As Tyson was riding into Jerusalem</l>
			<l>He fell and hurt his Alec Kafoozelum. </l>
		</lg>
		<p>This thrust put the two lieutenants to silence but Heron 
			went on: </p>
		<p>—In any case Byron was a heretic and immoral too. </p>
		<p>—I don't care what he was, cried Stephen hotly. </p>
		<p>—You don't care whether he was a heretic or not? said 
			Nash. </p>
		<p>—What do you know about it? shouted Stephen. You never 
			read a line of anything in your life except a trans or Boland 
			either. </p>
		<p>—I know that Byron was a bad man, said Boland. </p>
		<p>—Here, catch hold of this heretic, Heron called out. </p>
		<p>In a moment Stephen was a prisoner. </p>
		<p>—Tate made you buck up the other day, Heron went on, 
			about the heresy in your essay. </p>
		<p>—I'll tell him tomorrow, said Boland. </p>
		<p>—Will you? said Stephen. You'd be afraid to open your 
			lips. </p>
		<p>—Afraid? </p>
		<p>—Ay. Afraid of your life. </p>
		<p>—Behave yourself! cried Heron, cutting at Stephen's legs 
			with his cane. </p>
		<p>It was the signal for their  onset. Nash pinioned his arms 
			behind while Boland seized a long cabbage stump which was 
			lying in the gutter. Struggling and kicking under the cuts of the 
			cane and the blows of the knotty stump Stephen was borne 
			back against a barbed wire fence. </p>
		<p>—Admit that Byron was no good. </p>
		<p>—No. </p>
		<p>—Admit. </p>
		<p>—No. </p>
		<p>—Admit. </p>
		<p>—No. No. </p>
		<p>At last after a fury of plunges he wrenched himself free. His 
			tormentors set off towards Jones's Road, laughing and jeering 
			at him, while he, torn and flushed and panting, stumbled after 
			them half blinded with tears, clenching his fists madly and 
			sobbing. </p>
		<p>While he was still repeating the <seg xml:lang="lat"><hi rend="italic">Confiteor</hi></seg> amid the indulgent 
			laughter of his hearers and while the scenes of that malignant 
			episode were still passing sharply and swiftly before his 
			mind he wondered why he bore no malice now to those who 
			had tormented him. He had not forgotten a whit of their 
			cowardice and cruelty but the memory of it called forth no 
			anger from him. All the descriptions of fierce love and hatred 
			which he had met in books had  seemed to him therefore 
			unreal. Even that night as he stumbled homewards along 
			Jones's Road he had felt that some power was divesting him 
			of that suddenwoven anger as easily as a fruit is divested of its 
			soft ripe peel. </p>
		<p>He remained standing with his two companions at the end 
			of the shed, listening idly to their talk or to the bursts of applause 
			in the theatre. She was sitting there among the others 
			perhaps waiting for him to appear. He tried to recall her 
			appearance but could not. He could remember only that she 
			had worn a shawl about her head like a cowl and that her dark 
			eyes had invited and unnerved him. He wondered had he been 
			in her thoughts as she had been in his. Then in the dark and 
			unseen by the other two he rested the tips of the fingers of one 
			hand upon the palm of the other hand, scarcely touching it 
			and yet pressing upon it lightly. But the pressure of her fingers 
			had been lighter and steadier: and suddenly the memory of 
			their touch traversed his brain and body like an invisible warm 
			wave. </p>
		<p>A boy came towards them, running along under the shed. 
			He was excited and breathless. </p>
		<p>—O, Dedalus, he cried, Doyle is in a great bake about 
			you. You're to go in at once and get dressed for the play. 
			Hurry up, you better. </p>
		<p>—He's coming now, said Heron to the messenger with a 
			haughty drawl, when he wants to. </p>
		<p>The boy turned to Heron and repeated: </p>
		<p>—But Doyle is in an awful bake. </p>
		<p>—Will you tell Doyle with my best compliments that I 
			damned his eyes? answered Heron. </p>
		<p>—Well, I must go now, said Stephen, who cared little for 
			such points of honour. </p>
		<p>—I wouldn't, said Heron, damn me if I would. That's no 
			way to send for one of the senior boys. In a bake, indeed! I 
			think it's quite enough that you're taking a part in his bally old 
			play. </p>
		<p>This spirit of quarrelsome comradeship which he had observed 
			lately in his rival had not seduced Stephen from his 
			habits of quiet obedience. He mistrusted the turbulence and 
			doubted the sincerity of such comradeship which seemed to 
			him a sorry anticipation of manhood. The question of honour 
			here raised was, like all such questions, trivial to him. While 
			his mind had been pursuing its intangible phantoms and 
			turning in irresolution from such pursuit he had heard about 
			him the constant voices of his father and of his masters, urging 
			him to be a gentleman above all things and urging him to be a 
			good catholic above all things. These voices had now come to 
			be hollowsounding in his ears. When the gymnasium had 
			been opened he had heard another voice urging him to be 
			strong and manly and healthy and when the movement towards 
			national revival had begun to be felt in the college yet 
			another voice had bidden him  be true to his country and help 
			to raise up her fallen language and tradition. In the profane 
			world, as he foresaw, a worldly voice would bid him raise up 
			his father's fallen state by his labours and, meanwhile, the 
			voice of his school comrades urged him to be a decent fellow, 
			to shield others from blame or to beg them off and to do his 
			best to get free days for the school. And it was the din of all 
			these hollowsounding voices that made him halt irresolutely in 
			the pursuit of phantoms. He gave them ear only for a time but 
			he was happy only when he was far from them, beyond their 
			call, alone or in the company of phantasmal comrades. </p>
		<p>In the vestry a plump freshfaced jesuit and an elderly man, 
			in shabby blue clothes, were dabbling in a case of paints and 
			chalks. The boys who had been painted walked about or stood 
			still awkwardly, touching their faces in a gingerly fashion with 
			their furtive fingertips. In the middle of the vestry a young 
			jesuit, who was then on a visit to the college, stood rocking 
			himself rhythmically from the tips of his toes to his heels and 
			back again, his hands thrust well forward into his sidepockets. 
			His small head set off with glossy red curls and his newly 
			shaven face agreed well with the spotless decency of his soutane 
			and with his spotless shoes. </p>
		<p>As he watched this swaying form and tried to read for 
			himself the legend of the priest's mocking smile there came 
			into Stephen's memory a saying which he had heard from his 
			father before he had been sent to Clongowes, that you could 
			always tell a jesuit by the style of his clothes. At the same 
			moment he thought he saw a likeness between his father's 
			mind and that of this smiling welldressed priest: and he was 
			aware of some desecration of the priest's office or of the vestry 
			itself, whose silence was now routed by loud talk and joking 
			and its air pungent with the smells of the gasjets and the 
			grease. </p>
		<p>While his forehead was being wrinkled and his jaws painted 
			black and blue by the elderly man he listened distractedly to 
			the voice of the plump young jesuit which bade him speak up 
			and make his points clearly. He could hear the band playing 
			<i>The Lily of Killarney</i> and knew that in a few moments the 
			curtain would go up. He felt no stage fright but the thought of 
			the part he had to play humiliated him. A remembrance  of 
			some of his lines made a sudden flush rise to his painted 
			cheeks. He saw her serious alluring eyes watching him from 
			among the audience and their image at once swept away his 
			scruples, leaving his will compact. Another nature seemed to 
			have been lent him: the infection of the excitement and youth 
			about him entered into and transformed his moody mistrustfulness. 
			For one rare moment he seemed to be clothed in the 
			real apparel of boyhood: and, as he stood in the wings among 
			the other players, he shared the common mirth amid which 
			the drop scene was hauled upwards by two ablebodied priests 
			with violent jerks and all awry. </p>
		<p>A few moments after he found himself on the stage amid 
			the garish gas and the dim scenery, acting before the innumerable 
			faces of the void. It surprised him to see that the play 
			which he had known at rehearsals for a disjointed lifeless thing 
			had suddenly assumed a life of its own. It seemed now to play 
			itself, he and his fellow actors aiding it with their parts. When 
			the curtain fell on the last scene he heard the void filled with 
			applause and, through a rift in the side scene, saw the simple 
			body before which he had acted magically deformed, the void 
			of faces breaking at all points and falling asunder into busy 
			groups. </p>
		<p>He left the stage quickly and rid himself of his mummery 
			and passed out through the chapel into the college garden. 
			Now that the play was over his nerves cried for some further 
			adventure. He hurried onwards as if to overtake it. The doors 
			of the theatre were all open and the audience had emptied out. 
			On the lines which he had fancied the moorings of an ark a 
			few lanterns swung in the night breeze, flickering cheerlessly. 
			He mounted the steps from the garden in haste, eager that 
			some prey should not elude him, and forced his way through 
			the crowd in the hall and past the two jesuits who stood 
			watching the exodus and bowing and shaking hands with the 
			visitors. He pushed onward nervously, feigning a still greater 
			haste and faintly conscious of the smiles and stares and nudges 
			which his powdered head left in its wake. </p>
		<p>When he came out on the steps he saw his family waiting 
			for him at the first lamp. In a glance he noted that every figure 
			of the group was familiar and ran down the steps angrily. </p>
		<p>—I have to leave a message down in George's Street, he 
			said to his father quickly. I'll be home after you. </p>
		<p>Without waiting for his father's questions  he ran across the 
			road and began to walk at breakneck speed down the hill. He 
			hardly knew where he was walking. Pride and hope and desire 
			like crushed herbs in his heart sent up vapours of maddening 
			incense before the eyes of his mind. He strode down the hill 
			amid the tumult of suddenrisen vapours of wounded pride and 
			fallen hope and baffled desire. They streamed upwards before 
			his anguished eyes in dense and maddening fumes and passed 
			away above him till at last the air was clear and cold again. </p>
		<p>A film still veiled his eyes but they burned no longer. A 
			power, akin to that which had often made anger or resentment 
			fall from him, brought his steps to rest. He stood still and 
			gazed up at the sombre porch of the morgue and from that to 
			the dark cobbled laneway at its side. He saw the word <hi rend="italic">Lotts</hi> 
			on the wall of the lane and breathed slowly the rank heavy air. </p>
		<p>—That is horse piss and rotted straw, he thought. It is a 
			good odour to breathe. It will calm my heart. My heart is quite 
			calm now. I will go back. </p>

	<div n="2.4" type="section"> 

		<p>Stephen was once again seated beside his father in the 
			corner of a railway carriage at Kingsbridge. He was travelling 
			with his father by the night mail to Cork. As the train steamed 
			out of the station he recalled his childish wonder of years 
			before and every event of his first day at Clongowes. But he 
			felt no wonder now. He saw the darkening lands slipping past 
			him, the silent telegraphpoles passing his window swiftly every 
			four seconds, the little glimmering stations, manned by a few 
			silent sentries, flung by the mail behind her and twinkling for a 
			moment in the darkness like fiery grains flung backwards by a 
			runner. </p>
		<p>He listened without sympathy to his father's evocation of 
			Cork and of scenes of his youth, a tale broken by sighs or 
			draughts from his pocketflask whenever the image of some 
			dead friend appeared in it or whenever the evoker remembered 
			suddenly the purpose of his actual visit. Stephen heard but 
			could feel no pity. The images of the dead were all strange to 
			him save that of uncle Charles, an image which had lately 
			been fading out of memory. He knew, however, that his father's 
			property was going to be sold by auction and in the 
			manner of his own dispossession he felt the world give the lie 
			rudely to his phantasy. </p>
		<p>At Maryborough he fell asleep. When he awoke the train 
			had passed out of Mallow and his father was stretched asleep 
			on the other seat. The cold light of the dawn lay over the 
			country, over the unpeopled fields and the closed cottages. 
			The terror of sleep fascinated his mind as he watched the 
			silent country or heard from time to time his father's deep 
			breath or sudden sleepy movement. The neighbourhood of 
			unseen sleepers filled him with strange dread as though they 
			could harm him; and he prayed that the day might come 
			quickly. His prayer,  addressed neither to God nor saint, began 
			with a shiver, as the chilly morning breeze crept through the 
			chink of the carriage door to his feet, and ended in a trail of 
			foolish words which he made to fit the insistent rhythm of the 
			train; and silently, at intervals of four seconds, the 
			telegraphpoles held the galloping notes of the music between punctual 
			bars. This furious music allayed his dread and, leaning against 
			the windowledge, he let his eyelids close again. </p>
		<p>They drove in a jingle across Cork while it was still early 
			morning and Stephen finished his sleep in a bedroom of the 
			Victoria Hotel. The bright warm sunlight was streaming 
			through the window and he could hear the din of traffic. His 
			father was standing before the dressingtable, examining his 
			hair and face and moustache with great care, craning his neck 
			across the waterjug and drawing it back sideways to see the 
			better. While he did so he sang softly to himself with quaint 
			accent and phrasing: </p>
		<lg>
			<l>'Tis youth and folly </l>
			<l>Makes young men marry, </l>
			<l>So here, my love, I'll </l>
			<l>No longer stay.</l> 
			<l>What can't be cured, sure, </l>
			<l>Must be injured, sure, </l>
			<l>So I'll go to </l>
			<l>Amerikay.</l> 
			<l>My love she's handsome, </l>
			<l>My love she's bonny: </l>
			<l>She's like good whisky </l>
			<l>When it is new;</l> 
			<l>But when 'tis old </l>
			<l>And growing cold </l>
			<l>It fades and dies like </l>
			<l>The mountain dew.</l> 
		</lg>
		<p>The consciousness of the warm sunny city outside his 
			window and the tender tremors with which his father's voice 
			festooned the strange sad happy air, drove off all the mists of 
			the night's ill humour from Stephen's brain. He got up quickly 
			to dress and, when the song had ended, said: </p>
		<p>—That's much prettier than any of your other <hi rend="italic">come-all-yous</hi>. </p>
		<p>—Do you think so? asked Mr Dedalus. </p>
		<p>—I like it, said Stephen. </p>
		<p>—It's a pretty old air, said Mr Dedalus, twirling the points 
			of his moustache. Ah, but you should have heard Mick Lacy 
			sing it! Poor Mick Lacy! He had little turns for it, grace notes 
			he used to put in that I haven't got. That was the boy who 
			could sing a <hi rend="italic">come-all-you</hi>, if you like. </p>
		<p>Mr Dedalus had ordered drisheens for breakfast and during 
			the meal he crossexamined the waiter for local news. For the 
			most part they spoke at crosspurposes when a name was 
			mentioned, the waiter having in mind the present holder and 
			Mr Dedalus his father or perhaps his grandfather. </p>
		<p>—Well, I hope they haven't moved the Queen's College 
			anyhow, said Mr Dedalus, for I want to show it to this youngster 
			of mine. </p>
		<p>Along the Mardyke the trees were in bloom. They entered 
			the grounds of the college and were led by the garrulous 
			porter across the quadrangle. But their progress across the 
			gravel was brought to a halt after  every dozen or so paces by 
			some reply of the porter's. </p>
		<p>—Ah, do you tell me so? And is poor Pottlebelly dead? </p>
		<p>—Yes, sir. Dead, sir. </p>
		<p>During these halts Stephen stood awkwardly behind the two 
			men, weary of the subject and waiting restlessly for the slow 
			march to begin again. By the time they had crossed the quadrangle 
			his restlessness had risen to fever. He wondered how 
			his father, whom he knew for a shrewd suspicious man, could 
			be duped by the servile manners of the porter; and the lively 
			southern speech which had entertained him all the morning 
			now irritated his ears. </p>
		<p>They passed into the anatomy theatre where Mr Dedalus, 
			the porter aiding him, searched the desks for his initials. 
			Stephen remained in the background, depressed more than 
			ever by the darkness and silence of the theatre and by the air it 
			wore of jaded and formal study. On the desk before him he 
			read the word <hi rend="italic">Foetus</hi>  cut several times in the dark stained 
			wood. The sudden legend startled his blood: he seemed to feel 
			the absent students of the college about him and to shrink 
			from their company. A vision of their life, which his father's 
			words had been powerless to evoke, sprang up before him out 
			of the word cut in the desk. A broadshouldered student with a 
			moustache was cutting in the letters with a jackknife, seriously. 
			Other students stood or sat near him laughing at his 
			handiwork. One jogged his elbow. The big student turned on 
			him, frowning. He was dressed in loose grey clothes and had 
			tan boots. </p>
		<p>Stephen's name was called. He hurried down the steps of 
			the theatre so as to be as far away from the vision as he could 
			be and, peering closely at his father's initials, hid his flushed 
			face. </p>
		<p>But the word and the vision capered before his eyes as he 
			walked back across the quadrangle and towards the college 
			gate. It shocked him to find in the outer world a trace of what 
			he had deemed till then a brutish and individual malady of his 
			own mind. His recent monstrous reveries came thronging into 
			his memory. They too had sprung up before him, suddenly 
			and furiously, out of mere words. He had soon given in to 
			them and allowed them to sweep across and abase his intellect, 
			wondering always where they came from, from what den 
			of monstrous images, and always weak and humble towards 
			others, restless and sickened of himself when they had swept 
			over him. </p>
		<p>—Ay, bedad! And there's the Groceries sure enough! cried 
			Mr Dedalus. You often heard me speak of the Groceries, 
			didn't you, Stephen. Many's the time we went down there 
			when our names had been marked, a crowd of us, Harry 
			Peard and little Jack Mountain and Bob Dyas and Maurice 
			Moriarty, the Frenchman, and Tom O'Grady and Mick Lacy 
			that I told you of this morning and Joey Corbet and poor little 
			good hearted Johnny Keevers of the Tantiles. </p>
		<p>The leaves of the trees along the Mardyke were astir and 
			whispering in the sunlight. A team of cricketers passed, agile 
			young men in flannels and blazers, one of them carrying the 
			long green wicketbag. In a quiet bystreet a German band of 
			five players in faded uniforms and with battered brass instruments 
			was playing to an audience of street arabs and leisurely 
			messenger boys. A maid in a white cap and apron was watering 
			a box of plants on a sill which shone like a slab of limestone 
			in the warm glare. From another window open to the air 
			came the sound of a piano, scale after scale rising into the 
			treble. </p>
		<p>Stephen walked on at his father's side, listening to stories he 
			had heard before, hearing again the names of the scattered and 
			dead revellers who had been the companions of his father's 
			youth. And a faint sickness sighed in his heart. He recalled his 
			own equivocal position in Belvedere, a free boy, a leader 
			afraid of his own authority, proud and sensitive and suspicious, 
			battling against the squalor of his life and against the 
			riot of his mind. The letters cut in the stained wood of the 
			desk stared upon him, mocking his bodily weakness and futile 
			enthusiasms and making him loathe himself for his own mad 
			and filthy orgies. The spittle in his throat grew bitter and foul 
			to swallow and the faint sickness climbed to his brain so that 
			for a moment he closed his eyes and walked on in darkness. </p>
		<p>He could still hear his father's voice </p>
		<p>—When you kick out for yourself, Stephen - as I daresay 
			you will one of those days - remember, whatever you do, to 
			mix with gentlemen. When I was a young fellow I tell you I 
			enjoyed myself. I mixed with fine decent fellows. Everyone of 
			us could do something. One fellow had a good voice, another 
			fellow was a good actor, another could sing a good comic 
			song, another was a good oarsman or a good racketplayer, 
			another could tell a good story and so on. We kept the ball 
			rolling anyhow and enjoyed ourselves and saw a bit of life and 
			we were none the worse of it either. But we were all gentlemen, 
			Stephen - at least I hope we were - and bloody good 
			honest Irishmen too. That's the kind of fellows I want you to 
			associate with, fellows of the right kidney. I'm talking to you 
			as a friend, Stephen. I don't believe in playing the stern father. 
			I don't believe a son should be afraid of his father. No, I treat 
			you as your grandfather treated me when I was a young chap. 
			We were more like brothers than father and son. I'll never 
			forget the first day he caught me smoking. I was standing at 
			the end of the South Terrace one day with some maneens like 
			myself and sure we thought we were grand fellows because we 
			had pipes stuck in the corners of our mouths. Suddenly the 
			governor passed. He didn't say a word, or stop even. But the 
			next day, Sunday, we were out for a walk together and when 
			we were coming home he took out his cigar case and said: 
			<i>By the bye, Simon, I didn't know you smoked:</i> or something 
			like that. Of course I tried to carry it off as best I could. <hi rend="italic">If
				you want a good smoke</hi>, he said, <hi rend="italic">try one of these cigars. An
				American captain made me a present of them last night in
				Queenstown</hi>. </p>
		<p>Stephen heard his father's voice break into a laugh which 
			was almost a sob. </p>
		<p>—He was the handsomest man in Cork at that time, by 
			God he was! The women used to stand to look after him in the 
			street. </p>
		<p>He heard the sob passing loudly down his father's throat 
			and opened his eyes with a nervous impulse. The sunlight 
			breaking suddenly on his sight turned the sky and clouds into 
			a fantastic world of sombre masses with lakelike spaces of 
			dark rosy light. His very brain was sick and powerless. He 
			could scarcely interpret the letters of the signboards of the 
			shops. By his monstrous way of life he seemed to have put 
			himself beyond the limits of reality. Nothing moved him or 
			spoke to him from the real world unless he heard in it an echo 
			of the infuriated cries within him. He could respond to no 
			earthly or human appeal, dumb and insensible to the call of 
			summer and gladness and companionship, wearied and dejected 
			by his father's voice. He could scarcely recognise as his 
			his own thoughts, and repeated slowly to himself: </p>
		<p>—I am Stephen Dedalus. I am walking beside my father 
			whose name is Simon Dedalus. We are in Cork, in Ireland. 
			Cork is a city. Our room is in the Victoria Hotel. Victoria and 
			Stephen and Simon. Simon and Stephen and Victoria. Names. </p>
		<p>The memory of his childhood suddenly grew dim. He tried 
			to call forth some of its vivid moments but could not. He 
			recalled only names: Dante, Parnell, Clane, Clongowes. A 
			little boy had been taught geography by an old woman who 
			kept two brushes in her wardrobe. Then he had been sent 
			away from home to a college. In the college he had made his 
			first communion and eaten slim jim out of his cricketcap and 
			watched the firelight leaping and dancing on the wall of a little 
			bedroom in the infirmary and dreamed of being dead, of mass 
			being said for him by the rector in a black and gold cope, of 
			being buried then in the little graveyard of the community off 
			the main avenue of limes. But he had not died then. Parnell 
			had died. There had been no mass for the dead in the chapel 
			and no procession. He had not died but he had faded out like 
			a film in the sun. He had been lost or had wandered out of 
			existence for he no longer existed. How strange to think of 
			him passing out of existence in such a way, not by death but 
			by fading out in the sun or by being lost and forgotten somewhere 
			in the universe! It was strange to see his small body 
			appear again for a moment: a little boy in a grey belted suit. 
			His hands were in his sidepockets and his trousers were 
			tucked in at the  knees by elastic bands. </p>
		<p>On the evening of the day on which the property was sold 
			Stephen followed his father meekly about the city from bar to 
			bar. To the sellers in the market, to the barmen and barmaids, 
			to the beggars who importuned him for a lob Mr Dedalus told 
			the same tale, that he was an old Corkonian, that he had been 
			trying for thirty years to get rid of his Cork accent up in Dublin 
			and that Peter Pickackafax beside him was his eldest son 
			but that he was only a Dublin jackeen. </p>
		<p>They had set out early in the morning from Newcombe's 
			coffeehouse where Mr Dedalus' cup had rattled noisily against 
			its saucer, and Stephen had tried to cover that shameful sign 
			of his father's drinkingbout of the night before by moving his 
			chair and coughing. One humiliation had succeeded another: 
			the false smiles of the market sellers, the curvettings and 
			oglings of the barmaids with whom his father flirted, the 
			compliments and encouraging words of his father's friends. 
			They had told him that he had a great look of his grandfather 
			and Mr Dedalus had agreed that he was an ugly likeness. They 
			had unearthed traces of a Cork accent in his speech and made 
			him admit that the Lee was a much finer river than the Liffey. 
			One of them in order to put his Latin to the proof had made 
			him translate short passages from Dilectus and asked him 
			whether it was correct to say: <seg xml:lang="lat"><hi rend="italic">Tempora mutantur nos et 
					mutamur in illis</hi></seg> or <seg xml:lang="lat"><hi rend="italic">Tempora mutantur et nos mutamur in illis</hi></seg>. 
			Another, a brisk old man, whom Mr Dedalus called Johnny 
			Cashman, had covered him with confusion by asking him to 
			say which were prettier, the Dublin girls or the Cork girls. </p>
		<p>—He's not that way built, said Mr Dedalus. Leave him 
			alone. He's a levelheaded thinking boy who doesn't bother 
			his head about that kind of nonsense. </p>
		<p>—Then he's not his father's son, said the little old man. </p>
		<p>—I don't know, I'm sure, said Mr Dedalus, smiling 
			complacently. </p>
		<p>—Your father, said the little old man to Stephen, was the 
			boldest flirt in the city of Cork in his day. Do you know that? </p>
		<p>Stephen looked down and studied the tiled floor of the bar 
			into which they had drifted. </p>
		<p>—Now don't be putting ideas into his head, said Mr Dedalus. 
			Leave him to his Maker. </p>
		<p>—Yerra, sure I wouldn't put any ideas into his head. I'm 
			old enough to be his grandfather. And I am a grandfather, 
			said the little old man to Stephen. Do you know that? </p>
		<p>—Are you? asked Stephen. </p>
		<p>—Bedad I am, said the little old man. I have two bouncing 
			grandchildren out at Sunday's Well. Now then! What age do 
			you think I am? And I remember seeing your grandfather in 
			his red coat riding out to hounds. That was before you were 
			born. </p>
		<p>—Ay, or thought of, said Mr Dedalus. </p>
		<p>—Bedad I did, repeated the little old man. And, more than 
			that,  I can remember even your greatgrandfather, old John 
			Stephen Dedalus, and a fierce old fireeater he was. Now then! 
			There's a memory for you! </p>
		<p>—That's three generations - four generations, said another 
			of the company. Why, Johnny Cashman, you must be nearing 
			the century. </p>
		<p>—Well, I'll tell you the truth, said the little old man. I'm 
			just twentyseven years of age. </p>
		<p>—We're as old as we feel, Johnny, said Mr Dedalus. And 
			just finish what you have there, and we'll have another. Here, 
			Tim or Tom or whatever your name is, give us the same again 
			here. By God, I don't feel more than eighteen myself. There's 
			that son of mine there not half my age and I'm a better man 
			than he is any day of the week. </p>
		<p>—Draw it mild now, Dedalus. I think it's time for you to 
			take a back seat, said the gentleman who had spoken before. </p>
		<p>—No, by God! asserted Mr Dedalus. I'll sing a tenor song 
			against him or I'll vault a fivebarred gate against him or I'll 
			run with him after the hounds across the country as I did 
			thirty years ago along with the Kerry Boy and the best man 
			for it. </p>
		<p>—But he'll beat you here, said the little old man, tapping 
			his forehead and raising his glass to drain it. </p>
		<p>—Well, I hope he'll be as good a man as his father. That's 
			all I can say, said Mr Dedalus. </p>
		<p>—If he is, he'll do, said the little old man. </p>
		<p>—And thanks be to God, Johnny, said Mr Dedalus, that we 
			lived so long and did so little harm. </p>
		<p>—But did so much good, Simon, said the little old man 
			gravely. Thanks be to God we lived so long and did so much 
			good. </p>
		<p>Stephen watched the three glasses being raised from the 
			counter as his father and his two cronies drank to the memory 
			of their past. An abyss of fortune or of temperament sundered 
			him from them. His mind seemed older than theirs: it shone 
			coldly on their strifes and happiness and regrets like a moon 
			upon a younger earth. No life or youth stirred in him as it had 
			stirred in them. He had known neither the pleasure of companionship 
			with others nor the vigour of rude male health nor 
			filial piety. Nothing stirred within his soul but a cold and cruel 
			and loveless lust. His childhood was dead or lost and with it 
			his soul capable of simple joys, and he was drifting amid life 
			like the barren shell of the moon. </p>
		<lg>
			<l>Art thou pale for weariness </l>
			<l>Of climbing heaven and gazing on the earth, </l>
			<l>Wandering companionless ...? </l>
		</lg>
		<p>He repeated to himself the lines of Shelley's fragment. Its 
			alternation of sad human ineffectualness with vast inhuman 
			cycles of activity chilled him, and he forgot his own human 
			and ineffectual grieving. </p>

		<p>Stephen's mother and his brother and one of his cousins 
			waited at the corner of quiet Foster Place while he and his 
			father went up the steps and along the colonnade where the 
			highland sentry was parading. When they had passed into the 
			great hall and stood at the counter Stephen drew forth his 
			orders on the governor of the bank of Ireland for thirty and 
			three pounds; and these sums, the moneys of his exhibition 
			and essay prize, were paid over to him rapidly by the teller in 
			notes and in coin respectively. He bestowed them in his 
			pockets with feigned  composure and suffered the friendly 
			teller, to whom his father chatted, to take his hand across the 
			broad counter and wish him a brilliant career in after life. He 
			was impatient of their voices and could not keep his feet at 
			rest. But the teller still deferred the serving of others to say he 
			was living in changed times and that there was nothing like 
			giving a boy the best education that money could buy. Mr 
			Dedalus lingered in the hall gazing about him and up at the 
			roof and telling Stephen, who urged him to come out, that 
			they were standing in the house of commons of the old Irish 
			parliament. </p>
		<p>—God help us! he said piously, to think of the men of those 
			times, Stephen, Hely Hutchinson and Flood and Henry Grattan 
			and Charles Kendal Bushe, and the noblemen we have 
			now, leaders of the Irish people at home and abroad. Why, by 
			God, they wouldn't be seen dead in a tenacre field with them. 
			No, Stephen, old chap, I'm sorry to say that they are only as I 
			roved out one fine May morning in the merry month of sweet 
			July. </p>
		<p>A keen October wind was blowing round the bank. The 
			three figures standing at the edge of the muddy path had 
			pinched cheeks and watery eyes. Stephen looked at his thinly 
			clad mother and remembered that a few days before he had 
			seen a mantle priced at twenty guineas in the windows of 
			Barnardo's. </p>
		<p>—Well that's done, said Mr Dedalus. </p>
		<p>—We had better go to dinner, said Stephen. Where? </p>
		<p>—Dinner? said Mr Dedalus. Well, I suppose we had better, 
			what? </p>
		<p>—Some place that's not too dear, said Mrs Dedalus. </p>
		<p>—Underdone's? </p>
		<p>—Yes. Some quiet place. </p>
		<p>—Come along, said Stephen quickly. It doesn't matter 
			about the dearness. </p>
		<p>He walked on before them with short nervous steps, smiling. 
			They tried to keep up with him, smiling also at his eagerness. </p>
		<p>—Take it easy like a good young fellow, said his father. 
			We're not out for the half mile, are we? </p>
		<p>For a swift season of merrymaking the money of his prizes 
			ran through Stephen's  fingers. Great parcels of groceries and 
			delicacies and dried fruits arrived from the city. Every day he 
			drew up a bill of fare for the family and every night led a party 
			of three or four to the theatre to see <hi rend="italic">Ingomar</hi> or <hi rend="italic">The Lady of 
			Lyons</hi>. In his coat pockets he carried squares of Vienna chocolate 
			for his guests while his trousers' pockets bulged with 
			masses of silver and copper coins. He bought presents for 
			everyone, overhauled his room, wrote out resolutions, marshalled 
			his books up and down their shelves, pored upon all 
			kinds of price lists, drew up a form of commonwealth for the 
			household by which every member of it held some office, 
			opened a loan bank for his family and pressed loans on willing 
			borrowers so that he might have the pleasure of making out 
			receipts and reckoning the interests on the sums lent. When he 
			could do no more he drove up and down the city in trams. 
			Then the season of pleasure came to an end. The pot of pink 
			enamel paint gave out and the wainscot of his bedroom remained 
			with its unfinished and illplastered coat. </p>
		<p>His household returned to its usual way of life. His mother 
			had no further occasion to upbraid him for squandering his 
			money. He too returned to his old life at school and all his 
			novel enterprises fell to pieces. The commonwealth fell, the 
			loan bank closed its coffers and its books on a sensible loss, 
			the rules of life which he had drawn about himself fell into 
			desuetude. </p>
		<p>How foolish his aim had been! He had tried to build a 
			breakwater of order and elegance against the sordid tide of life 
			without him and to dam up, by rules of conduct and active 
			interests and new filial relations, the powerful recurrence of 
			the tides within him. Useless. From without as from within the 
			water had flowed over his barriers: their tides began once 
			more to jostle fiercely above the crumbled mole. </p>
		<p>He saw clearly too his own futile isolation. He had not gone 
			one step nearer the lives he had sought to approach nor 
			bridged the restless shame and rancour that divided him from 
			mother and brother and sister. He felt that he was hardly of 
			the one blood with them but stood to them rather in the mystical 
			kinship of fosterage, fosterchild and fosterbrother. </p>
		<p>He burned to appease the fierce longings of his heart before 
			which everything else was idle and alien. He cared little that 
			he was in mortal sin, that his life had grown to be a tissue of 
			subterfuge and falsehood. Beside the savage desire within him 
			to realise the enormities which he brooded on nothing was 
			sacred. He bore cynically with the shameful details of his 
			secret riots in which he exulted to defile with patience whatever 
			image had attracted his eyes. By day and by night he 
			moved among distorted images of the outer world. A figure 
			that had seemed to him by day demure and innocent  came 
			towards him by night through the winding darkness of sleep, 
			her face transfigured by a lecherous cunning, her eyes bright 
			with brutish joy. Only the morning pained him with its dim 
			memory of dark orgiastic riot, its keen and humiliating sense of 
			transgression. </p>
		<p>He returned to his wanderings. The veiled autumnal evenings 
			led him from street to street as they had led him years 
			before along the quiet avenues of Blackrock. But no vision of 
			trim front gardens or of kindly lights in the windows poured a 
			tender influence upon him now. Only at times, in the pauses of 
			his desire, when the luxury that was wasting him gave room to 
			a softer languor, the image of Mercedes traversed the background 
			of his memory. He saw again the small white house 
			and the garden of rosebushes on the road that led to the 
			mountains and he remembered the sadly proud gesture of 
			refusal which he was to make there, standing with her in the 
			moonlit garden after years of estrangement and adventure. At 
			those moments the soft speeches of Claude Melnotte rose to 
			his lips and eased his unrest. A tender premonition touched 
			him of the tryst he had then looked forward to and, in spite of 
			the horrible reality which lay between his hope of then and 
			now, of the holy encounter he had then imagined at which 
			weakness and timidity and inexperience were to fall from him. </p>

		<p>Such moments passed and the wasting fires of lust sprang 
			up again. The verses passed from his lips and the inarticulate 
			cries and the unspoken brutal words rushed forth from his 
			brain to force a passage. His blood was in revolt. He wandered 
			up and down the dark slimy streets peering into the 
			gloom of lanes and doorways, listening eagerly for any sound. 
			He moaned to himself like some baffled prowling beast. He 
			wanted to sin with another of his kind, to force another being 
			to sin with him and to exult with her in sin. He felt some dark 
			presence moving irresistibly upon him from the  darkness, a 
			presence subtle and murmurous as a flood filling him wholly 
			with itself. Its murmur besieged his ears like the murmur of 
			some multitude in sleep; its subtle streams penetrated his 
			being. His hands clenched convulsively and his teeth set 
			together as he suffered the agony of its penetration. He 
			stretched out his arms in the street to hold fast the frail swooning 
			form that eluded him and incited him: and the cry that he 
			had strangled for so long in his throat issued from his lips. It 
			broke from him like a wail of despair from a hell of sufferers 
			and died in a wail of furious entreaty, a cry for an iniquitous 
			abandonment, a cry which was but the echo of an obscene 
			scrawl which he had read on the oozing wall of a urinal. </p>
		<p>He had wandered into a maze of narrow and dirty streets. 
			From the foul laneways he heard bursts of hoarse riot and 
			wrangling and the drawling of drunken singers. He walked 
			onward, undismayed, wondering whether he had strayed into 
			the quarter of the jews. Women and girls dressed in long vivid 
			gowns traversed the street from house to house. They were 
			leisurely and perfumed. A trembling seized him and his eyes 
			grew dim. The yellow gasflames arose before his troubled 
			vision against the vapoury sky, burning as if before an altar. 
			Before the doors and in the lighted halls groups were gathered 
			arrayed as for some rite. He was in another world: he had 
			awakened from a slumber of centuries. </p>
		<p>He stood still in the middle of the roadway, his heart clamouring 
			against his bosom in a tumult. A young woman dressed 
			in a long pink gown laid her hand on his arm to detain him 
			and gazed into his face. She said gaily: </p>
		<p>—Good night, Willie dear! </p>
		<p>Her room was warm and lightsome. A huge doll sat with 
			her legs apart in the copious easychair beside the bed. He tried 
			to bid his tongue speak that he might seem at ease, watching 
			her as she undid her gown, noting the proud conscious movements 
			of her perfumed head. </p>
		<p>As he stood silent in the middle of the room she came over 
			to him and embraced him gaily and gravely. Her round arms 
			held him firmly to her and he, seeing her face lifted to him in 
			serious calm and feeling the warm calm rise and fall of her 
			breast, all but burst into hysterical weeping. Tears of joy and 
			relief shone in his delighted eyes and his lips parted though 
			they would not speak. </p>
		<p>She passed her tinkling hand through his hair, calling him a 
			little rascal. </p>
		<p>—Give me a kiss, she said. </p>
		<p>His lips would not bend to kiss her. He wanted to be held 
			firmly in her arms, to be caressed slowly, slowly, slowly. In her 
			arms he felt that he had suddenly become strong and fearless 
			and sure of himself. But his lips would not bend to kiss her. </p>
		<p>With a sudden movement she bowed his head and joined 
			her lips to his and he read the meaning of her movements in 
			her frank uplifted eyes. It was too much for him. He closed his 
			eyes, surrendering himself to her, body and mind, conscious of 
			nothing in the world but the dark pressure of her softly parting 
			lips. They pressed upon his brain as upon his lips as though 
			they were the vehicle of a vague speech; and between them he 
			felt an unknown and timid pressure, darker than the swoon of 
			sin, softer than sound or odour. </p>

		<head><l>III</l></head>

		<p>The swift December dusk had come tumbling clownishly 
			after its dull day and, as he stared through the dull 
			square of the window of the schoolroom, he felt his belly crave 
			for its food. He hoped there would be stew for dinner, turnips 
			and carrots and bruised potatoes and fat mutton pieces to be 
			ladled out in thick peppered flourfattened sauce. Stuff it into 
			you, his belly counselled him. </p>
		<p>It would be a gloomy secret night. After early nightfall the 
			yellow lamps would light up, here and there, the squalid 
			quarter of the brothels. He would follow a devious course up 
			and down the streets, circling always nearer and nearer in a 
			tremor of fear and joy, until his feet led him suddenly round a 
			dark corner. The whores would be just coming out of their 
			houses making ready for the night, yawning lazily after their 
			sleep and settling the hairpins in their clusters of hair. He 
			would pass by them calmly waiting for a sudden movement of 
			his own will or a sudden call to his sinloving soul from their 
			soft perfumed flesh. Yet as he prowled in quest of that call, his 
			senses, stultified only by his desire, would note keenly all that 
			wounded or shamed them; his eyes, a ring of porter froth on a 
			clothless table or a photograph of two soldiers standing to 
			attention or a gaudy playbill; his ears, the drawling jargon of 
			greeting: </p>
		<p>—Hello, Bertie, any good in your mind? </p>
		<p>—Is that you, pigeon? </p>
		<p>—Number ten. Fresh Nelly is waiting on you. </p>
		<p>—Goodnight, husband! Coming in to have a short time? </p>
		<p>The equation on the page of his scribbler began to spread 
			out a widening tail, eyed and starred like a peacock's; and, 
			when the eyes and stars of its indices had been eliminated, 
			began slowly to fold itself together again. The indices appearing 
			and disappearing were eyes opening and closing; the eyes 
			opening and closing were stars being born and being 
			quenched. The vast cycle of starry life bore his weary  mind 
			outward to its verge and inward to its centre, a distant music 
			accompanying him outward and inward. What music? The 
			music came nearer and he recalled the words, the words of 
			Shelley's fragment upon the moon wandering companionless, 
			pale for weariness. The stars began to crumble and a cloud of 
			fine stardust fell through space. </p>
		<p>The dull light fell more faintly upon the page whereon 
			another equation began to unfold itself slowly and to spread 
			abroad its widening tail. It was his own soul going forth to 
			experience, unfolding itself sin by sin, spreading abroad the 
			balefire of its burning stars and folding back upon itself, fading 
			slowly, quenching its own lights and fires. They were 
			quenched: and the cold darkness filled chaos. </p>
		<p>A cold lucid indifference reigned in his soul. At his first 
			violent sin he had felt a wave of vitality pass out of him and 
			had feared to find his body or his soul maimed by the excess. 
			Instead the vital wave had carried him on its bosom out of 
			himself and back again when it receded: and no part of body 
			or soul had been maimed but a dark peace had been established 
			between them. The chaos in which his ardour extinguished 
			itself was a cold indifferent knowledge of himself. He 
			had sinned mortally not once but many times and he knew 
			that, while he stood in danger of eternal damnation for the 
			first sin alone, by every succeeding sin he multiplied his guilt 
			and his punishment. His days and works and thoughts could 
			make no atonement for him, the fountains of sanctifying grace 
			having ceased to refresh his soul. At most, by an alms given to 
			a beggar whose blessing he fled from, he might hope wearily 
			to win for himself some measure of actual grace. Devotion 
			had gone by the board. What did it avail to pray when he 
			knew that his soul lusted after its own destruction? A certain 
			pride, a certain awe, withheld him from offering to God even 
			one prayer at night though he knew it was in God's power to 
			take away his life while he slept and hurl his soul hellward ere 
			he could beg for mercy. His pride in his own sin, his loveless 
			awe of God, told him that his offence was too grievous to be 
			atoned for in whole or in part by a false homage to the Allseeing 
			and Allknowing. </p>
		<p>—Well now, Ennis, I declare you have a head and so has 
			my stick! Do you mean to say that you are not able to tell 
			me what a surd is? </p>
		<p>The blundering answer stirred the embers of his contempt 
			of his fellows. Towards others he felt neither shame nor fear. 
			On Sunday mornings as he passed the churchdoor he glanced 
			coldly at the worshippers who stood bareheaded, four deep, 
			outside the church, morally present at the mass which they 
			could neither see nor hear. Their dull piety and the sickly smell 
			of the cheap hairoil with which they had anointed their heads 
			repelled him from the altar they prayed at. He stooped to the 
			evil of hypocrisy with others, sceptical of their innocence 
			which he could cajole so easily. </p>
		<p>On the wall of his bedroom hung an illuminated scroll, the 
			certificate of his prefecture in the college of the sodality of the 
			Blessed Virgin Mary. On Saturday mornings when the sodality 
			met in the chapel to recite the little office his place was a 
			cushioned kneelingdesk at the right of the altar from which he 
			led his wing of boys through the responses. The falsehood of 
			his position did not pain him. If at moments he felt an impulse 
			to rise from his post of honour and, confessing before them all 
			his unworthiness, to leave the chapel, a glance at their faces 
			restrained him. The imagery of the psalms of prophecy 
			soothed his barren pride. The glories of Mary held his soul 
			captive: spikenard and myrrh and frankincense, symbolising 
			the preciousness of God's gifts to her soul, rich garments, 
			symbolising her royal lineage, her emblems, the lateflowering 
			plant and lateblossoming tree, symbolising the agelong gradual 
			growth of her cultus among men. When it fell to him to 
			read the lesson towards the close of the office he read it in a 
			veiled voice, lulling his conscience to its music. </p>
		<lg>
			<l>Quasi cedrus exaltata sum in Libanon et quasi cupressus in </l>
			<l>monte Sion. Quasi palma exaltata sum in Gades et quasi </l>
			<l>plantatio rosae in Jericho. Quasi uliva speciosa in campis et </l>
			<l>quasi platanus exaltata sum juxta aquam in plateis. Sicut </l>
			<l>cinnamomum et balsamum aromatizans odorem dedi et quasi </l>
			<l>myrrha electa dedi suavitatem odoris.</l>
		</lg>
		<p>His sin, which had covered him from the sight of God, had 
			led him nearer to the refuge of sinners. Her eyes seemed to 
			regard him with mild pity; her holiness, a strange light glowing 
			faintly upon her frail flesh, did not humiliate the sinner who 
			approached her. If ever he was impelled to cast sin from him 
			and to repent the impulse that moved him was the wish to be 
			her knight. If ever his soul, reentering her dwelling shyly after 
			the frenzy of his body's lust had spent itself, was turned towards 
			her whose emblem is the morning star, <hi rend="italic">bright and 
			musical, telling of heaven and infusing peace</hi>, it was when her 
			names were murmured softly by lips whereon there still lingered 
			foul and shameful words, the savour itself of a lewd kiss. </p>
		<p>That was strange. He tried to think how it could be but the 
			dusk, deepening in the schoolroom, covered over his thoughts. 
			The bell rang. The master marked the sums and cuts to be 
			done for the next lesson and went out. Heron, beside Stephen, 
			began to hum tunelessly. </p>
		<l><i>My excellent friend Bombados.</i> </l>
		<p>Ennis, who had gone to the yard, came back, saying: </p>
		<p>—The boy from the house is coming up for the rector. </p>
		<p>A tall boy behind Stephen rubbed his hands and said: </p>
		<p>—That's game ball. We can scut the whole hour. He won't 
			be in till after half two. Then you can ask him questions on the 
			catechism, Dedalus. </p>
		<p>Stephen, leaning back and drawing idly on his scribbler, 
			listened to the talk about him which Heron checked from time 
			to time by saying: </p>
		<p>—Shut up, will you. Don't make such a bally racket! </p>
		<p>It was strange too that he found an arid pleasure in following 
			up to the end the rigid lines of the doctrines of the church 
			and penetrating into obscure silences  only to hear and feel the 
			more deeply his own condemnation. The sentence of saint 
			James which says that he who offends against one commandment 
			becomes guilty of all had seemed to him first a swollen 
			phrase until he had begun to grope in the darkness of his own 
			state. From the evil seed of lust all other deadly sins had 
			sprung forth: pride in himself and contempt of others, covetousness 
			in using money for the purchase of unlawful pleasure, 
			envy of those whose vices he could not reach to and 
			calumnious murmuring against the pious, gluttonous  enjoyment 
			of food, the dull glowering anger amid which he brooded 
			upon his longing, the swamp of spiritual and bodily sloth in 
			which his whole being had sunk. </p>
		<p>As he sat in his bench gazing calmly at the rector's shrewd 
			harsh face his mind wound itself in and out of the curious 
			questions proposed to it. If a man had stolen a pound in his 
			youth and had used that pound to amass a huge fortune 
			how much was he obliged to give back, the pound he had 
			stolen only or the pound together with the compound interest 
			accruing upon it or all his huge fortune? If a layman in giving 
			baptism pour the water before saying the words is the child 
			baptised? Is baptism with a mineral water valid? How comes 
			it that while the first beatitude promises the kingdom of 
			heaven to the poor of heart the second beatitude promises also 
			to the meek that they shall possess the land? Why was the 
			sacrament of the eucharist instituted under the two species of 
			bread and wine if Jesus Christ be present body and blood, soul 
			and divinity, in the bread alone and in the wine alone? Does a 
			tiny particle of the consecrated bread contain all the body and 
			blood of Jesus Christ or a part only of the body and blood? If 
			the wine change into vinegar and the host crumble  into corruption 
			after they have been consecrated is Jesus Christ still 
			present under their species as God and as man? </p>
		<p>—Here he is! Here he is! </p>
		<p>A boy from his post at the window had seen the rector 
			come from the house. All the catechisms were opened and all 
			heads bent upon them silently. The rector entered and took 
			his seat on the dais. A gentle kick from the tall boy in the 
			bench behind urged Stephen to ask a difficult question. </p>
		<p>The rector did not ask for a catechism to hear the lesson 
			from. He clasped his hands on the desk and said: </p>
		<p>—The retreat will begin on Wednesday afternoon in honour 
			of saint Francis Xavier whose feast day is Saturday. The 
			retreat will go on from Wednesday to Friday. On Friday 
			confession will be heard all the afternoon after beads. If any 
			boys have special confessors perhaps it will be better for them 
			not to change. Mass will be on Saturday morning at nine 
			o'clock and general communion for the whole college. Saturday 
			will be a free day. Sunday of course. But Saturday and 
			Sunday being free days some boys might be inclined to think 
			that Monday is a free day also. Beware of making that mistake. 
			I think you, Lawless, are likely to make that mistake. </p>
		<p>—I, sir? Why,  sir? </p>
		<p>A little wave of quiet mirth broke forth over the class of 
			boys from the rector's grim smile. Stephen's heart began 
			slowly to fold and fade with fear like a withering flower. </p>
		<p>The rector went on gravely: </p>
		<p>—You are all familiar with the story of the life of saint 
			Francis Xavier, I suppose, the patron of your college. He 
			came of an old and illustrious Spanish family and you remember 
			that he was one of the first followers of saint Ignatius. 
			They met in Paris where Francis Xavier was professor of 
			philosophy at the university. This young and brilliant nobleman 
			and man of letters entered heart and soul into the ideas of 
			our glorious founder, and you know that he, at his own desire, 
			was sent by saint Ignatius to preach to the Indians. He is 
			called, as you know, the apostle of the Indies. He went from 
			country to country in the east, from Africa to India, from 
			India to Japan, baptising  the people. He is said to have baptised 
			as many as ten thousand idolaters in one month. It is said 
			that his right arm had grown powerless from having been 
			raised so often over the heads of those whom he baptised. He 
			wished then to go to China to win still more souls for God but 
			he died of fever on the island of Sancian. A great saint, saint 
			Francis Xavier! A great soldier of God! </p>
		<p>The rector paused and then, shaking his clasped hands 
			before him, went on: </p>
		<p>—He had the faith in him that moves mountains. Ten 
			thousand souls won for God in a single month! That is a true 
			conqueror, true to the motto of our order: <seg xml:lang="lat"><hi rend="italic">ad majorem Dei 
				gloriam</hi></seg>! A saint who has great power in heaven, remember: 
			power to intercede for us in our grief, power to obtain whatever 
			we pray for if it be for the good of our souls, power 
			above all to obtain for us the grace to repent if we be in sin. A 
			great saint, saint Francis Xavier! A great fisher of souls! </p>
		<p>He ceased to shake his clasped hands and, resting them 
			against his forehead, looked right and left of them keenly at 
			his listeners out of his dark stern eyes. </p>
		<p>In the silence their dark fire kindled the dusk into a tawny 
			glow. Stephen's heart had withered up like a flower of the 
			desert that feels the simoom  coming from afar. </p>

		<p>—<i>Remember only thy last things and thou shalt not sin for</i> 
			<i>ever</i> -  words taken, my dear little brothers in Christ, from the 
			book of Ecclesiastes, seventh chapter, fortieth verse. In the 
			name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost. 
			Amen. </p>
		<p>Stephen sat in the front bench of the chapel. Father Arnall 
			sat at a table to the left of the altar. He wore about his shoulders 
			a heavy cloak; his pale face was drawn and his voice 
			broken with rheum. The figure of his old master, so strangely 
			rearisen, brought back to Stephen's mind his life at Clongowes: 
			the wide playgrounds, swarming with boys, the square 
			ditch, the little cemetery off the main avenue of limes where 
			he had dreamed of being buried, the firelight on the wall of the 
			infirmary where he lay sick, the sorrowful face of Brother 
			Michael. His soul, as these memories came back to him, 
			became again a child's soul. </p>
		<p>—We are assembled here today, my dear little brothers in 
			Christ, for one brief moment far away from the busy bustle of 
			the outer world to celebrate and to honour one of the greatest 
			of  saints, the apostle of the Indies, the patron saint also of 
			your college, saint Francis Xavier. Year after year for much 
			longer than any of you, my dear little boys, can remember or 
			than I can remember the boys of this college have met in this 
			very chapel to make their annual retreat before the feast day 
			of their patron saint. Time has gone on and brought with it its 
			changes. Even in the last few years what changes can most of 
			you not remember? Many of the boys who sat in those front 
			benches a few years ago are perhaps now in distant lands, in 
			the burning tropics or immersed in professional duties or in 
			seminaries or voyaging over the vast expanse of the deep or, it 
			may be, already called by the great God to another life and to 
			the rendering up of their stewardship. And still as the years 
			roll by, bringing with them changes for good and bad, the 
			memory of the great saint is honoured by the boys of his 
			college who make every year their annual retreat on the days 
			preceding the feast day set apart by our holy mother  the 
			church to transmit to all the ages the name and fame of one of 
			the greatest sons of catholic Spain. </p>
		<p>—Now what is the meaning of this word <hi rend="italic">retreat</hi> and why is 
			it allowed on all hands to be a most salutary practice for all 
			who desire to lead before God and in the eyes of men a truly 
			christian life? A retreat, my dear boys, signifies a withdrawal 
			for a while from the cares of our life, the cares of this workaday 
			world, in order to examine the state of our conscience, to 
			reflect on the mysteries of holy religion and to understand 
			better why we are here in this world. During these few days I 
			intend to put before you some thoughts concerning the four 
			last things. They are, as you know from your catechism, 
			death, judgment,  hell and heaven. We shall try to understand 
			them fully during these few days so that we may derive from 
			the understanding of them a lasting benefit to our souls. And 
			remember, my dear boys, that we have been sent into this 
			world for one thing and for one thing alone: to do God's holy 
			will and to save our immortal souls. All else is worthless. One 
			thing alone is needful, the salvation of one's soul. What doth it 
			profit a man to gain the whole world if he suffer the loss of his 
			immortal soul? Ah, my dear boys, believe me there is nothing 
			in this wretched world that can make up for such a loss. </p>
		<p>—I will ask you therefore, my dear boys, to put away from 
			your minds during these few days all worldly thoughts, 
			whether of study or pleasure or ambition, and to give all your 
			attention to the state of your souls. I need hardly remind you 
			that during the days of the retreat all boys are expected to 
			preserve a quiet and pious demeanour and to shun all loud 
			unseemly pleasure. The elder boys, of course, will see that this 
			custom is not infringed and I look especially to the prefects 
			and officers of the sodality of Our Blessed Lady and of the 
			sodality of the holy angels to set a good example to their 
			fellowstudents. </p>
		<p>—Let us try therefore to make this retreat in honour of 
			saint Francis with our whole heart and our whole mind. God's 
			blessing will then be upon all your year's studies. But, above 
			and beyond all, let this retreat be one to which you can look 
			back in after years when maybe you are far from this college 
			and among very different surroundings, to which you can look 
			back with joy and thankfulness and give thanks to God for 
			having granted you this occasion of laying the first foundation 
			of a pious honourable zealous christian life. And if, as may so 
			happen, there be at this moment in these benches any poor 
			soul who has had the unutterable misfortune to lose God's 
			holy grace and to fall into grievous sin I fervently trust and 
			pray that this retreat may be the turningpoint in the life of that 
			soul. I pray to God  through the merits of its zealous servant 
			Francis Xavier that such a soul may be led to sincere repentance 
			and that  the holy communion on saint Francis' day of 
			this year may be a lasting covenant between God and that 
			soul. For just and unjust, for saint and sinner alike, may this 
			retreat be a memorable one. </p>
		<p>—Help me, my dear little brothers in Christ. Help me by 
			your pious attention, by your own devotion, by your outward 
			demeanour. Banish from your minds all worldly thoughts and 
			think only of the last things, death, judgment, hell and heaven. 
			He who remembers these things, says Ecclesiastes, shall not 
			sin for ever. He who remembers the last things will act and 
			think with them always before his eyes. He will live a good life 
			and die a good death, believing and knowing that, if he has 
			sacrificed  much in this earthly life, it will be given to him a 
			hundredfold and a thousandfold more in the life to come, in 
			the kingdom without end - a blessing, my dear boys, which I 
			wish you from my heart, one and all, in the name of the Father 
			and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost. Amen. </p>
		<p>As he walked home with silent companions a thick fog 
			seemed to compass his mind. He waited in stupor of mind till 
			it should lift and reveal what it had hidden. He ate his dinner 
			with surly appetite and, when the meal was over and the 
			greasestrewn plates lay abandoned on the table, he rose and 
			went to the window, clearing the thick scum from his mouth 
			with his tongue and licking it from his lips. So he had sunk to 
			the state of a beast that licks his chaps after meat. This was 
			the end; and a faint glimmer of fear began to pierce the fog of 
			his mind. He pressed his face against the pane of the window 
			and gazed out into the darkening street. Forms passed this 
			way and that through the dull light. And that was life. The 
			letters of the name of Dublin lay heavily upon his mind, pushing 
			one another surlily hither and thither with slow boorish 
			insistence. His soul was fattening and congealing into a gross 
			grease, plunging ever deeper in its dull fear into a sombre 
			threatening dusk, while the body that was his stood, listless 
			and dishonoured, gazing out of darkened eyes, helpless, perturbed 
			and human for a bovine god to stare upon. </p>
		<p>The next day brought death and judgment, stirring his soul 
			slowly from its listless despair. The faint glimmer of fear 
			became a terror of spirit as the hoarse voice of the preacher 
			blew death into his soul. He suffered its agony. He felt the 
			deathchill touch the extremities and creep onward towards the 
			heart, the film of death veiling the eyes, the bright centres of 
			the brain extinguished one by one like lamps, the last sweat 
			oozing upon the skin, the powerlessness of the dying limbs, 
			the speech thickening and wandering and failing, the heart 
			throbbing faintly and more faintly, all but vanquished, the 
			breath, the poor breath, the poor helpless human spirit, sobbing 
			and sighing,  gurgling  and rattling in the throat. No help! 
			No help! He, he himself, his body to which he had yielded was 
			dying. Into the grave with it! Nail it down into a wooden box, 
			the corpse. Carry it out of the house on the shoulders of 
			hirelings. Thrust it out of men's sight into a long hole in the 
			ground, into the grave, to rot, to feed the mass of its creeping 
			worms and to be devoured by scuttling plumpbellied rats. </p>
		<p>And while the friends were still standing in tears by the 
			bedside the soul of the sinner was judged. At the last moment 
			of consciousness the whole earthly life passed before the 
			vision of the soul and, ere it had time to reflect, the body had 
			died and the soul stood terrified before the judgmentseat. 
			God, who had long been merciful, would then be just. He had 
			long been patient, pleading with the sinful soul, giving it time 
			to repent, sparing it yet awhile. But that time had gone. Time 
			was to sin and to enjoy, time was to scoff at God and at  the 
			warnings of His holy church, time was to defy His majesty, to 
			disobey his commands, to hoodwink one's fellow men, to 
			commit sin after sin and sin after sin and to hide one's corruption 
			from the sight of men. But that time was over. Now it was 
			God's turn: and He was not to be hoodwinked or deceived. 
			Every sin would then come forth from its lurkingplace, the 
			most rebellious against the divine will and the most degrading 
			to our poor corrupt nature, the tiniest imperfection and the 
			most heinous atrocity. What did it avail then to have been a 
			great emperor, a great general, a marvellous inventor, the 
			most learned of the learned? All were as one before the judgmentseat 
			of God. He would reward the good and punish the 
			wicked. One single instant was enough for the trial of a man's 
			soul. One single instant after the body's death, the soul had 
			been weighed in the balance. The particular judgment was 
			over and the soul had passed to the abode of bliss or to the 
			prison of purgatory or had been hurled howling into hell. </p>
		<p>Nor was that all. God's justice had still to be vindicated 
			before men: after the particular there still remained the general 
			judgment. The last day had come. Doomsday was at 
			hand. The stars of heaven were falling upon the earth like the 
			figs cast by the figtree which the wind has shaken. The sun, the 
			great luminary of the universe, had become as sackcloth of 
			hair. The moon was bloodred. The firmament was as a scroll 
			rolled away. The archangel Michael, the prince of the 
			heavenly host, appeared glorious and terrible against the sky. 
			With one foot on the sea and one foot on the land he blew 
			from the archangelical trumpet the brazen death of time. The 
			three blasts of the angel filled all the universe. Time is, time 
			was but time shall be no more. At the last blast the souls of 
			universal humanity throng towards the valley of Jehoshaphat, 
			rich and poor, gentle and simple, wise and foolish, good and 
			wicked. The soul of every human being that has ever existed, 
			the souls of all those who shall yet be born, all the sons and 
			daughters of Adam, all are assembled on that supreme day. 
			And lo the supreme judge is coming! No longer the lowly 
			Lamb of God, no longer the meek Jesus of Nazareth, no 
			longer the Man of Sorrows, no longer the Good Shepherd,  He 
			is seen now coming upon the clouds, in great power and 
			majesty, attended by nine choirs of angels, angels and archangels, 
			principalities, powers and virtues, thrones and dominations, 
			cherubim and seraphim, God Omnipotent, God Everlasting. 
			He speaks: and His voice is heard even at the farthest 
			limits of space, even in the bottomless abyss. Supreme Judge, 
			from His sentence there will be and can be no appeal. He calls 
			the just to His side, bidding them enter into the kingdom, the 
			eternity of bliss, prepared for them. The unjust He casts from 
			Him, crying in His offended majesty: <hi rend="italic">Depart from me, ye 
			cursed, into everlasting fire which was prepared for the devil
			and his angels.</hi> O what agony then for the miserable sinners! 
			Friend is torn apart from friend, children are torn from their 
			parents, husbands from their wives. The poor sinner holds out 
			his arms to those who were dear to him in this earthly world, 
			to those whose simple piety perhaps he made a mock of, to 
			those who counselled him and tried to lead him on the right 
			path, to a kind brother, to a loving sister, to the mother and 
			father who loved him so dearly. But it is too late: the just turn 
			away from the wretched damned souls which now appear 
			before the eyes of all in their hideous and evil character. O 
			you hypocrites, O you whited sepulchres, O you who present a 
			smooth smiling face to the world while your soul within is a 
			foul swamp of sin, how will it fare with you in that terrible 
			day? </p>
		<p>And this day will come, shall come, must come; the day of 
			death and the day of judgment. It is appointed unto man to 
			die and after death the judgment. Death is certain. The time 
			and  manner are uncertain,  whether from long disease or from 
			some unexpected accident; the Son of God cometh at an hour 
			when you little expect Him. Be therefore ready every moment, 
			seeing that you may die at any moment. Death is the end of us 
			all. Death and judgment, brought into the world by the sin of 
			our first parents, are the dark portals that close our earthly 
			existence, the portals that open into the unknown and the 
			unseen, portals through which every soul must pass, alone, 
			unaided save by its good works, without friend or  brother or 
			parent or master to help it, alone and trembling. Let that 
			thought be ever before our minds and then we cannot sin. 
			Death, a cause of terror to the sinner, is a blessed moment for 
			him who has walked in the right path, fulfilling the duties of 
			his station in life, attending to his morning and evening 
			prayers, approaching the holy sacrament frequently and performing 
			good and merciful works. For the pious and believing 
			catholic, for the just man, death is no cause of terror. Was it 
			not Addison, the great English writer, who, when on his 
			deathbed, sent for the wicked young earl of Warwick to let 
			him see how a christian can meet his end. He it is and he alone, 
			the pious and believing christian, who can say in his heart: </p>
		<lg>
			<l>O grave, where is thy victory? </l>
			<l>O death, where is thy sting? </l>
		</lg>
		<p>Every word of it was for him. Against his sin, foul and 
			secret, the whole wrath of God was aimed. The preacher's 
			knife had probed deeply into his diseased conscience and he 
			felt now that his soul was festering in sin. Yes, the preacher 
			was right. God's turn had come. Like a beast in its lair his soul 
			had lain down in its own filth but the blasts of the angel's 
			trumpet had driven him forth from the darkness of sin into the 
			light. The words of doom cried by the angel shattered in an 
			instant his presumptuous peace. The wind of the last day blew 
			through his mind; his sins, the jeweleyed harlots of his imagination, 
			fled before the hurricane, squeaking like mice in their 
			terror and huddled under a mane of hair. </p>
		<p>As he crossed the square, walking homeward, the light 
			laughter of a girl reached his burning ear. The frail gay sound 
			smote his heart more strongly than a trumpetblast, and, not 
			daring to lift his eyes, he turned aside and gazed, as he walked, 
			into the shadow of the tangled shrubs. Shame rose from his 
			smitten heart and flooded his whole being. The image of 
			Emma appeared before him and, under her eyes, the flood of 
			shame rushed forth anew from his heart. If she knew to what 
			his mind had subjected her or how his brutelike lust had torn 
			and trampled upon her innocence! Was that boyish love? Was 
			that chivalry? Was that poetry? The sordid details of his orgies 
			stank under his very nostrils: the sootcoated packet of pictures 
			which he had hidden in the flue of the fireplace and in 
			the presence of whose shameless or bashful  wantonness he lay 
			for hours sinning in thought and deed; his monstrous dreams, 
			peopled by apelike creatures and by harlots with gleaming 
			jewel eyes; the foul long letters he had written in the joy of 
			guilty confession and carried secretly for days and days only 
			to throw them under cover of night among the grass in the 
			corner of a field or beneath some hingeless door or in some 
			niche in the hedges where a girl might come upon them as she 
			walked by and read them secretly. Mad! Mad! Was it possible 
			he had done these things? A cold sweat broke out upon his 
			forehead as the foul memories condensed within his brain. </p>
		<p>When the agony of shame had passed from him he tried to 
			raise his soul from its abject powerlessness. God and the 
			Blessed Virgin were too far from him: God was too great and 
			stern and the Blessed Virgin too pure and holy. But he imagined 
			that he stood near Emma in a wide land and,  humbly  and 
			in tears, bent and kissed the elbow of her sleeve. </p>
		<p>In the wide land under a tender lucid evening sky, a cloud 
			drifting westward amid a pale green sea of heaven, they stood 
			together, children that had  erred. Their error had offended 
			deeply God's majesty though it was the error of two children, 
			but it had not offended her whose beauty <hi rend="italic">is not like earthly 
			beauty, dangerous to look upon, but like the morning star 
			which is its emblem, bright and musical</hi>. The eyes were not 
			offended which she turned upon them nor reproachful. She 
			placed their hands together, hand in hand, and said, speaking 
			to their hearts: </p>
		<p>—Take hands, Stephen and Emma. It is a beautiful evening 
			now in heaven. You have erred but you are always my children. 
			It is one heart that loves another heart. Take hands 
			together,  my  dear children, and you  will  be happy together 
			and your hearts will love each other. </p>
		<p>The chapel was flooded by the dull scarlet light that filtered 
			through the lowered blinds; and through the fissure between 
			the last blind and the sash a shaft of wan light entered like a 
			spear and touched the embossed brasses of the candlesticks 
			upon the altar that gleamed like the battleworn mail armour of 
			angels. </p>
		<p>Rain was falling on the chapel, on the garden, on the college. 
			It would rain for ever, noiselessly. The water would rise 
			inch by inch, covering the grass and shrubs, covering the trees 
			and houses, covering the monuments and the mountain tops. 
			All life would be choked off, noiselessly: birds, men, elephants, 
			pigs, children: noiselessly floating corpses amid the 
			litter of the wreckage of the world. Forty days and forty nights 
			the rain would fall till the waters covered the face of the earth. </p>
		<p>It might be. Why not? </p>
		<p>—<i>Hell has enlarged its soul and opened its mouth without</i> 
			<i>any limits</i> - words taken, my dear little brothers in Christ 
			Jesus, from the book of Isaias, fifth chapter, fourteenth verse. 
			In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy 
			Ghost. Amen. </p>
		<p>The preacher took a chainless watch from a pocket within 
			his soutane and, having considered its dial for a moment in 
			silence, placed it silently before him on the table. </p>
		<p>He began  to speak in a quiet tone. </p>
		<p>—Adam  and Eve, my dear boys, were, as you know, our 
			first parents and you will remember that they were created by 
			God in order that the seats in heaven left vacant by the fall of 
			Lucifer and his rebellious angels might be filled again. Lucifer, 
			we are  told, was a son of the morning, a radiant and mighty 
			angel; yet he fell: he fell and there fell with him a third part of 
			the host of heaven: he fell and was hurled with his rebellious 
			angels into hell. What his sin was we cannot say. Theologians 
			consider that it was the sin of pride, the sinful thought conceived 
			in an instant: <hi rend="italic">non serviam: I will not serve</hi>. That 
			instant was his ruin. He offended the majesty of God by the 
			sinful thought of one instant and God cast him out of heaven 
			into hell for ever. </p>
		<p>—Adam and Eve were then created by God and placed in 
			Eden, in the plain of Damascus, that lovely garden resplendent 
			with sunlight and colour, teeming with luxuriant vegetation. 
			The fruitful earth gave them her bounty: beasts and birds 
			were their willing servants: they knew not the ills our flesh is 
			heir to, disease and poverty and death: all that a great and 
			generous God could do for them was done. But there was one 
			condition imposed on them by God: obedience to His word. 
			They were not to eat of the fruit of the forbidden tree. </p>
		<p>—Alas, my dear little boys, they too fell. The devil, once a 
			shining angel, a son of the morning, now a foul fiend, came in 
			the shape of a serpent, the subtlest of all the beasts of the field. 
			He envied them. He, the fallen great one, could not bear to 
			think that man, a being of clay, should possess the inheritance 
			which he by his sin had forfeited for ever. He came to the 
			woman, the weaker vessel, and poured the poison of his 
			eloquence into her ear, promising her - O, the blasphemy of 
			that promise! - that if she and Adam ate of the forbidden fruit 
			they would become as gods, nay as God Himself. Eve yielded 
			to the wiles of the archtempter. She ate the apple and gave it 
			also to Adam who had not the moral courage to resist her. 
			The poison tongue of Satan had done its work. They fell. </p>
		<p>—And then the voice of God was heard in that garden, 
			calling His creature man to account: and Michael, prince of 
			the heavenly host, with a sword of flame in his hand appeared 
			before the guilty pair and drove them forth from Eden into the 
			world, the world of sickness and striving, of cruelty and 
			disappointment, of labour and hardship, to earn their bread in 
			the sweat of their brow. But even then how merciful was God! 
			He took pity on our poor degraded parents and promised that 
			in the fulness of time He would send down from heaven One 
			who would redeem them, make them once more children of 
			God and heirs to the kingdom of heaven: and that One, that 
			Redeemer of fallen man, was to be God's onlybegotten  Son, 
			the Second Person of the Most Blessed Trinity, the Eternal 
			Word. </p>
		<p>—He came. He was born of a virgin pure, Mary the virgin 
			mother. He was born in a poor cowhouse in Judea and lived 
			as a humble carpenter for thirty years until the hour of His 
			mission had come. And then, filled with love for men, He went 
			forth and called to men to hear the new gospel. </p>
		<p>—Did they listen? Yes, they listened but would not hear. 
			He was seized and bound like a common criminal, mocked at 
			as a fool, set aside to give place to a public robber, scourged 
			with five thousand lashes, crowned with a crown of thorns, 
			hustled through the streets by the jewish rabble and the Roman 
			soldiery, stripped of his garments and hanged upon a 
			gibbet and His side was pierced with a lance and from the 
			wounded body of Our Lord water and blood issued continually. </p>
		<p>—Yet even then, in that hour of supreme agony, Our 
			Merciful Redeemer had pity for mankind. Yet even there, on 
			the hill of Calvary, He founded the holy catholic church 
			against which, it is promised, the gates of hell shall not prevail. 
			He founded it upon the rock of ages and endowed it with His 
			grace, with sacraments and sacrifice, and promised that if men 
			would obey the word of His church they would still enter into 
			eternal life but if, after all that had been done for them, they 
			still persisted in their wickedness there  remained for them an 
			eternity of torment: hell. </p>
		<p>The preacher's voice sank. He paused, joined his palms for 
			an instant, parted them. Then he resumed: </p>
		<p>—Now let us try for a moment to realise, as far as we can, 
			the nature of that abode of the damned which the justice of an 
			offended God has called into existence for the eternal punishment 
			of sinners. Hell is a strait and dark and foulsmelling 
			prison, an abode of demons and lost souls, filled with fire and 
			smoke. The straitness of this prisonhouse is expressly designed 
			by God to punish those who refused to be bound by 
			His laws. In earthly prisons the poor captive has at least 
			some liberty of movement, were it only within the four walls 
			of his cell or in the gloomy yard of his prison. Not so in hell. 
			There, by reason of the great number of the damned, the 
			prisoners are heaped together in their awful prison, the walls 
			of which are said to be four thousand miles thick: and the 
			damned are so utterly bound and helpless that, as a blessed 
			saint, saint Anselm, writes in his book on similitudes, they are 
			not even able to remove from the eye a worm that gnaws it. </p>
		<p>—They lie in exterior darkness. For, remember, the fire of 
			hell gives forth no light. As, at the command of God, the fire 
			of the Babylonian furnace lost its heat but not its light so, at 
			the command of God, the fire of hell, while retaining the 
			intensity of its heat, burns eternally in darkness. It is a 
			neverending storm of darkness, dark flames and dark smoke of 
			burning brimstone, amid which the bodies are heaped one 
			upon another without even a glimpse of air. Of all the plagues 
			with which the land of the Pharaohs was smitten one plague 
			alone, that of darkness, was called horrible. What name, then, 
			shall we give to the darkness of hell which is to last not for 
			three days alone but for all eternity? </p>
		<p>—The horror of this strait and dark prison is increased by 
			its awful stench. All the filth of the world, all the offal and 
			scum of the world, we are told, shall run there as to a vast 
			reeking sewer when the terrible conflagration of the last day 
			has purged the world. The brimstone too which burns there in 
			such prodigious  quantity fills all hell with its intolerable 
			stench; and the bodies of the damned themselves exhale such 
			a pestilential odour that as saint Bonaventure says, one of 
			them alone would suffice to infect the whole world. The very 
			air of this world, that pure element, becomes foul and unbreathable 
			when it has been long enclosed. Consider then 
			what must be the foulness of the air of hell. Imagine some foul 
			and putrid corpse that has lain rotting and decomposing in the 
			grave, a jellylike mass of liquid corruption. Imagine such a 
			corpse a prey to  flames, devoured by the fire of burning brimstone 
			and giving off dense choking fumes of nauseous loathsome 
			decomposition. And then imagine this sickening stench, 
			multiplied a millionfold and a millionfold again from the 
			millions upon millions of fetid carcasses massed together in 
			the reeking darkness,  a huge and rotting human fungus. Imagine 
			all this and you will have some idea of the horror of the 
			stench of hell. </p>
		<p>—But this stench is not, horrible though it is, the greatest 
			physical torment to which the damned are subjected. The 
			torment of fire is the greatest torment to which the tyrant has 
			ever subjected his fellowcreatures. Place your finger for a 
			moment in the flame of a candle and you will feel the pain of 
			fire. But our earthly fire was created by God for the benefit of 
			man, to maintain in him the spark of life and to help him in 
			the useful arts whereas the fire of hell is of another quality 
			and was created by God to torture and punish the unrepentant 
			sinner. Our earthly fire also consumes more or less rapidly 
			according as the object which it attacks is more or less combustible 
			so that human ingenuity has even succeeded in inventing 
			chemical preparations to check or frustrate its action. 
			But the sulphurous brimstone which burns in hell is a substance 
			which is specially designed to burn for ever and for 
			ever with unspeakable fury. Moreover our earthly fire destroys 
			at the same time as it burns so that the more intense it is 
			the shorter is its duration: but the fire of hell has this property 
			that it preserves that which it burns and though it rages with 
			incredible intensity it rages for ever. </p>
		<p>—Our earthly fire again, no matter how fierce or widespread 
			it may be, is always of a limited extent: but the lake of 
			fire in hell is boundless, shoreless and bottomless. It is on 
			record that the devil himself, when asked the question by a 
			certain soldier, was obliged to confess that if a whole mountain 
			were thrown into the burning ocean of hell it would be 
			burned up in an instant like a piece of wax. And this terrible 
			fire will not afflict the bodies of the damned only from without 
			but each lost soul will be a hell unto itself, the boundless 
			fire raging in its very vitals. O, how terrible is the lot of those 
			wretched beings! The blood seethes and boils in the veins, the 
			brains are boiling in the skull, the heart in the breast glowing 
			and bursting, the bowels a redhot mass of burning pulp, the 
			tender eyes flaming like molten balls. </p>
		<p>—And yet what I have said as to the strength and quality 
			and boundlessness of this fire is as nothing when compared to 
			its intensity, an intensity which it has as being the instrument 
			chosen by divine design for the punishment of soul and body 
			alike. It is a fire which proceeds directly from the ire of God, 
			working not of its own activity but as an instrument of divine 
			vengeance. As the waters of baptism cleanse the soul with the 
			body so do the fires of punishment torture the spirit with the 
			flesh. Every sense of the flesh is tortured and every faculty of 
			the soul therewith: the eyes with impenetrable utter darkness, 
			the nose with noisome odours, the ears with yells and howls 
			and execrations, the taste with foul matter, leprous corruption, 
			nameless suffocating filth, the touch with redhot goads and 
			spikes, with cruel tongues of flame. And through the several 
			torments of the senses the immortal soul is tortured eternally 
			in its very essence amid the leagues upon leagues of glowing 
			fires kindled in the abyss by the offended majesty of the Omnipotent 
			God and fanned into everlasting and ever increasing 
			fury by the breath of the anger of the Godhead. </p>
		<p>—Consider finally that the torment of this infernal prison is 
			increased by the company of the damned themselves. Evil 
			company on earth is so noxious that even the plants, as if by 
			instinct, withdraw from the company of whatsoever is deadly 
			or hurtful to them. In hell all laws are overturned: there is no 
			thought of family or country, of ties, of relationships. The 
			damned howl and scream at one another, their torture and 
			rage intensified by the presence of beings tortured and raging 
			like themselves. All sense of humanity is forgotten. The yells 
			of the suffering sinners fill the remotest corners of the vast 
			abyss. The mouths of the damned are full of blasphemies 
			against God and of hatred for their fellowsufferers and of 
			curses against those souls which were their  accomplices in sin. 
			In olden times it was the custom to punish the parricide, the 
			man who had raised his murderous hand against his father, by 
			casting him into the depths of the sea in a sack in which were 
			placed a cock, a monkey and a serpent. The intention of those 
			lawgivers who framed such a law, which seems cruel in our 
			times, was to punish the criminal by the company of hateful 
			and hurtful beasts. But what is the fury of those dumb beasts 
			compared with the fury of execration which bursts from the 
			parched lips and aching throats of the damned in hell when 
			they behold in their companions in misery those who aided 
			and abetted them in sin, those whose words sowed the 
			first seeds of evil thinking and evil living in their minds, those 
			whose immodest suggestions led them on to sin, those whose 
			eyes tempted and allured them from the path of virtue. They 
			turn upon those accomplices and upbraid them and curse 
			them. But they are helpless and hopeless: it is too late now for 
			repentance. </p>
		<p>—Last of all consider the frightful torment to those damned 
			souls, tempters and tempted alike,  of the company of the 
			devils. These devils will afflict the damned in two ways, by 
			their presence and by their reproaches. We can have no idea 
			of how horrible these devils are. Saint Catherine of Siena once 
			saw a devil and she has written that, rather than look again for 
			one single instant on such a frightful monster, she would 
			prefer to walk until the end of her life along a track of red 
			coals. These devils, who were once beautiful angels, have 
			become as hideous and ugly as they once were beautiful. They 
			mock and  jeer at the lost souls whom they dragged down to 
			ruin. It is they, the foul demons, who are made in hell the 
			voices of conscience. Why did you sin? Why did you lend an 
			ear to the temptings of fiends? Why did you turn aside from 
			your pious practices and good works? Why did you not shun 
			the occasions of sin? Why did you not leave that evil companion? 
			Why did you not give up that lewd habit, that impure 
			habit? Why did you not listen to the counsels of your confessor? 
			Why did you not, even after you had fallen the first or the 
			second or the third or the fourth or the hundredth time, repent 
			of your evil ways and turn to God who only waited for your 
			repentance to absolve you of your sins? Now the time for 
			repentance has gone by. Time is, time was, but time shall be 
			no more! Time was to sin in secrecy, to indulge in that sloth 
			and pride, to covet the unlawful, to yield to the promptings of 
			your lower nature, to live like the beasts of the field, nay worse 
			than the beasts of the field for they, at least, are but brutes 
			and have not reason to guide them: time was but time shall be 
			no more. God spoke to you by so many voices but you would 
			not hear. You would not crush out that pride and anger in 
			your heart, you would not restore those illgotten goods, you 
			would not obey the precepts of your holy church nor attend to 
			your religious duties, you would not abandon those wicked 
			companions, you would not avoid those dangerous temptations. 
			Such is the language of those fiendish tormentors, words 
			of taunting and of reproach, of hatred and of disgust. Of 
			disgust, yes! For even they, the very devils, when they sinned 
			sinned by such a sin as alone was compatible with such angelical 
			natures, a rebellion of the intellect: and they, even they, 
			the foul devils must turn away, revolted and disgusted, from 
			the contemplation of those unspeakable sins by which degraded 
			man outrages and defiles the temple of the Holy Ghost, 
			defiles and pollutes himself. </p>
		<p>—O, my dear little brothers in Christ, may it never be our 
			lot to hear that language! May it never be our lot, I say! In the 
			last day of terrible reckoning I pray fervently to God that not 
			a single soul of those who are in this chapel today may be 
			found among those miserable beings whom the Great Judge 
			shall command to depart for ever from His sight, that not one 
			of us may ever hear ringing in his ears the awful sentence of 
			rejection: <hi rend="italic">Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire 
			which was prepared for the devil and his angels!</hi> </p>
		<p>He came down the aisle of the chapel, his legs shaking and 
			the scalp of his head trembling as though it had been touched 
			by ghostly fingers. He passed up the staircase and into the 
			corridor along the walls of which the overcoats and waterproofs 
			hung like gibbeted malefactors, headless and dripping 
			and shapeless. And at every step he feared that he had already 
			died, that his soul had been wrenched forth of the sheath of 
			his body, that he was plunging headlong through space. </p>
		<p>He could not grip the floor with his feet and sat heavily at 
			his desk, opening one of his books at random and poring over 
			it. Every word for him! It was true. God was almighty. God 
			could call him now, call him as he sat at his desk, before he 
			had time to be conscious of the summons. God had called 
			him. Yes? What? Yes? His flesh shrank together as it felt the 
			approach of the ravenous tongues of flames, dried up as it felt 
			about it the swirl of stifling air. He had died. Yes. He was 
			judged. A wave of fire swept through his body: the first. Again 
			a wave. His brain began to glow. Another. His brain was 
			simmering and bubbling within the cracking tenement of the 
			skull. Flames burst forth from his skull like a corolla, shrieking 
			like voices: </p>
		<p>—Hell! Hell! Hell! Hell! Hell! </p>
		<p>Voices spoke near him: </p>
		<p>—On hell. </p>
		<p>—I suppose he rubbed it into you well. </p>
		<p>—You bet he did. He put us all into a blue funk. </p>
		<p>—That's what you fellows want: and plenty of it to make 
			you work. </p>
		<p>He leaned back weakly in his desk. He had not died. God 
			had spared him still. He was still in the familiar world of the 
			school. Mr Tate and Vincent Heron stood at the window, 
			talking, jesting, gazing out at the bleak rain, moving their 
			heads. </p>
		<p>—I wish it would clear up. I had arranged to go for a spin 
			on the bike with some fellows out by Malahide. But the roads 
			must be kneedeep. </p>
		<p>—It might clear up, sir. </p>
		<p>The voices that he knew so well, the common words, the 
			quiet of the classroom when the voices paused and the silence 
			was filled by the sound of softly browsing cattle as the other 
			boys munched their lunches tranquilly, lulled his aching soul. </p>
		<p>There was still time. O Mary, refuge of sinners, intercede 
			for him! O Virgin Undefiled, save him from the gulf of death! </p>
		<p>The English lesson began with the hearing of the history. 
			Royal persons, favourites, intriguers, bishops, passed like 
			mute phantoms behind their veil of names. All had died: all 
			had been judged. What did it profit a man to gain the whole 
			world if he lost his soul? At last he had understood: and 
			human life lay around him, a plain of peace whereon antlike 
			men laboured in brotherhood, their dead sleeping under quiet 
			mounds. The elbow of his companion touched him and his 
			heart was touched: and when he spoke to answer a question 
			of his master he heard his own voice full of the quietude of 
			humility and contrition. </p>
		<p>His soul sank back deeper into depths of contrite peace, no 
			longer able to suffer the pain of dread, and sending forth, as 
			she sank, a faint prayer. Ah yes, he would still be spared; he 
			would repent in his heart and be forgiven; and then those 
			above, those in heaven, would see what he would do to make 
			up for the past: a whole life, every hour of life. Only wait. </p>
		<p>—All, God! All, all! </p>
		<p>A messenger came to the door to say that confessions were 
			being heard in the chapel. Four boys left the room; and he 
			heard others passing down the corridor. A tremulous chill 
			blew round his heart, no stronger than a little wind, and yet, 
			listening and suffering silently, he seemed to have laid an ear 
			against the muscle of his own heart, feeling it close and quail, 
			listening to the flutter of its ventricles. </p>
		<p>No escape. He had to confess, to speak out in words what 
			he had done and thought, sin after sin. How? How? </p>
		<p>—Father, I ... </p>
		<p>The thought slid like a cold shining rapier into his tender 
			flesh: confession. But not there in the chapel of the college. 
			He would confess all, every sin of deed and thought, sincerely: 
			but not there among his school companions. Far away from 
			there in some dark place he would murmur out his own 
			shame: and he besought God humbly not to be offended with 
			him if he did not dare to confess in the college chapel: and in 
			utter abjection of spirit he craved forgiveness mutely of the 
			boyish hearts about him. </p>
		<p>Time passed. </p>
		<p>He sat again in the front bench of the chapel. The daylight 
			without was already failing and, as it fell slowly through the 
			dull red blinds, it seemed that the sun of the last day was going 
			down and that all souls were being gathered for the judgment. </p>
		<p>—<i>I am cast away from the sight of Thine eyes:</i> words 
			taken, my dear little brothers in Christ, from the Book of 
			Psalms, thirtieth chapter, twentythird verse. In the name of 
			the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost. Amen. </p>
		<p>The preacher began to speak in a quiet friendly tone. His 
			face was kind and he joined gently the fingers of each hand, 
			forming a frail cage by the union of their tips. </p>
		<p>—This morning we endeavoured, in our reflection upon 
			hell, to make what our holy founder calls in his book of spiritual 
			exercises, the composition of place. We endeavoured, that 
			is, to imagine with the senses of the mind, in our imagination, 
			the material character of that awful place and of the physical 
			torments which all who are in hell endure. This evening we 
			shall consider for a few moments the nature of the spiritual 
			torments of hell. </p>
		<p>—Sin, remember, is a twofold enormity. It is a base consent 
			to the promptings of our corrupt nature to the lower instincts, 
			to that which is gross and beastlike; and it is also a turning 
			away from the counsel of our higher nature, from all that is 
			pure and holy, from the Holy God Himself. For this reason 
			mortal sin is punished in hell by two different forms of punishment, 
			physical and spiritual. </p>
		<p>—Now  of all these spiritual pains by far the greatest is the 
			pain of loss, so great, in fact, that in itself it is a torment 
			greater than all the others. Saint Thomas, the greatest doctor 
			of the church, the angelic doctor, as he is called, says that the 
			worst damnation consists in this that the understanding of 
			man is totally deprived of divine light and his affection obstinately 
			turned away from the goodness of God. God, remember, 
			is a being infinitely good and therefore the loss of such a 
			being must be a loss infinitely painful. In this life we have not 
			a very clear idea of what such a loss must be but the damned 
			in hell, for their greater torment, have a full understanding of 
			that which they have lost and understand  that they have lost it 
			through their own sins and have lost it for ever. At the very 
			instant of death the bonds of the flesh are broken asunder and 
			the soul at once flies towards God. The soul tends towards 
			God as towards the centre of her existence. Remember, my 
			dear little boys, our souls long to be with God. We come from 
			God, we live by God, we belong to God: we are His, inalienably 
			His. God loves with a divine love every human soul and 
			every human soul lives in that love. How could it be otherwise? 
			Every breath that we draw, every thought of our brain, 
			every instant of life proceed from God's inexhaustible goodness. 
			And if it be pain for a mother to be parted from her 
			child, for a man to be exiled from hearth and home, for friend 
			to be sundered from friend, O think what pain, what anguish, 
			it must be for the poor soul to be spurned from the presence 
			of the supremely good and loving Creator Who has called that 
			soul into existence from nothingness and sustained it in life 
			and loved it with an immeasurable love. This, then, to be 
			separated for ever from its greatest good, from God, and to 
			feel the anguish of that separation, knowing full well that it is 
			unchangeable, this is the greatest torment which the created 
			soul is capable of bearing, <seg xml:lang="lat">></seg>, the pain of loss. </p>
		<p>—The second pain which will afflict the souls of the damned 
			in hell is the pain of conscience. Just as in dead bodies worms 
			are engendered by putrefaction so in the souls of the lost there 
			arises a perpetual remorse from the putrefaction of sin, the 
			sting of conscience, the worm, as Pope Innocent the Third 
			calls it, of the triple sting. The first sting inflicted by this 
			cruel worm will be the memory of past pleasures. O what a dreadful 
			memory will that be! In the lake of alldevouring flame the 
			proud king will remember the pomps of his court, the wise but 
			wicked man his libraries and instruments of research, the lover 
			of artistic pleasures his marbles and pictures and other art 
			treasures, he who delighted in the pleasures of the table his 
			gorgeous feasts, his dishes prepared with such delicacy, his 
			choice wines; the miser will remember his hoard of gold, the 
			robber his illgotten wealth, the angry and revengeful and 
			merciless murderers their deeds of blood and violence in 
			which they revelled, the impure and adulterous the unspeakable 
			and filthy pleasures in which they delighted. They will 
			remember all this and loathe themselves and their sins. For 
			how miserable will all those pleasures seem to the soul condemned 
			to suffer in hellfire for ages and ages. How they will 
			rage and fume to think that they have lost the bliss of heaven 
			for the dross of earth, for a few pieces of metal, for vain 
			honours, for bodily comforts, for a tingling of the nerves. 
			They will repent indeed: and this is the second sting of the 
			worm of conscience, a late and fruitless sorrow for sins committed. 
			Divine justice insists that the understanding of those 
			miserable wretches be fixed continually on the sins of which 
			they were guilty and moreover, as saint Augustine points out, 
			God will impart to them His own knowledge of sin so that sin 
			will appear to them in all its hideous malice as it appears to 
			the eyes of God Himself. They will behold their sins in all 
			their foulness and repent but it will be too late and then they 
			will bewail the good occasions which they neglected. This is 
			the last and deepest and most cruel sting of the worm of 
			conscience. The conscience will say: You had time and 
			opportunity to repent and would not. You were brought up 
			religiously by your parents. You had the sacraments and 
			graces and indulgences of the church to aid you. You had the 
			minister of God to preach to you, to call you back when you 
			had strayed, to forgive you your sins, no matter how many, 
			how abominable, if only you had confessed and repented. No. 
			You would not. You flouted the ministers of holy religion, you 
			turned your back on the confessional, you wallowed deeper 
			and deeper in the mire of sin. God appealed to you, threatened 
			you, entreated you to return to Him. O what shame, what 
			misery! The Ruler of the universe entreated you, a creature 
			of clay, to love Him Who  made you and to keep His law. No. 
			You would not. And now, though you were to flood all hell 
			with your tears if you could still weep, all that sea of repentance 
			would not gain for you what a single tear of true repentance 
			shed during your mortal life would have gained for you. 
			You implore now a moment of earthly life wherein to repent: 
			in vain. That time is gone: gone for ever. </p>
		<p>—Such is the threefold sting of conscience, the viper which 
			gnaws the very heart's core of the wretches in hell so that filled 
			with hellish fury they curse themselves for their folly and curse 
			the evil companions who have brought them to such ruin and 
			curse the devils who tempted them in life and now mock them 
			and torture them in eternity and even revile and curse the 
			Supreme Being Whose goodness and patience they scorned 
			and slighted but Whose justice and power they cannot evade. </p>
		<p>—The next spiritual pain to which the damned are subjected 
			is the pain of extension. Man, in this earthly life, though 
			he be capable of many evils, is not capable of them all at once 
			inasmuch as one evil corrects and counteracts  another just as 
			one poison frequently corrects another. In hell on the contrary 
			one torment, instead of counteracting another, lends it still 
			greater force: and moreover as the internal faculties are more 
			perfect than the external senses, so are they more capable of 
			suffering. Just as every sense is afflicted with a fitting torment 
			so is every spiritual faculty; the fancy with horrible images, the 
			sensitive faculty with alternate longing and rage, the mind and 
			understanding with an interior darkness more terrible even 
			than the exterior darkness which reigns in that dreadful 
			prison. The malice, impotent though it be, which possesses 
			these demon souls is an evil of boundless extension, of limitless 
			duration, a frightful state of wickedness which we can 
			scarcely realise unless we bear in mind the enormity of sin and 
			the hatred God bears to it. </p>
		<p>—Opposed to this pain of extension and yet coexistent with 
			it we have the pain of intensity. Hell is the centre of evils and, 
			as you know, things are more intense at their centres than at 
			their remotest points. There are no contraries or admixtures of 
			any kind to temper or soften in the least the pains of hell. Nay, 
			things which are good in themselves become evil in hell. 
			Company, elsewhere a source of comfort to the afflicted, will 
			be there a continual torment: knowledge, so much longed for 
			as the chief good of the intellect, will there be hated worse 
			than ignorance: light, so much coveted by all creatures from 
			the lord of creation down to the humblest plant in the forest, 
			will be loathed intensely. In this life our sorrows are either not 
			very long or not very great because nature either overcomes 
			them by habits or puts an end to them by sinking under their 
			weight. But in hell the torments cannot be overcome by habit. 
			For while they are of terrible intensity they are at the same 
			time of continual variety, each pain, so to speak, taking fire 
			from another and reendowing that which has enkindled it with 
			a still fiercer flame. Nor can nature escape from these intense 
			and various tortures by succumbing to them for the soul is 
			sustained and maintained in evil so that its suffering may be 
			the greater. Boundless extension of torment, incredible intensity 
			of suffering, unceasing variety of torture - this is what the 
			divine majesty, so outraged by sinners, demands, this is what 
			the holiness of heaven, slighted and set aside for the lustful 
			and low pleasures of the corrupt flesh, requires, this is what the 
			blood of the innocent Lamb of God, shed for the redemption 
			of sinners, trampled upon by the vilest of the vile, insists upon. </p>
		<p>—Last and crowning torture of all the tortures of that awful 
			place is the eternity of hell. Eternity! O, dread and dire word. 
			Eternity! What mind of man can understand it? And, remember, 
			it is an eternity of pain. Even though the pains of hell 
			were not so terrible as they are yet they would become infinite 
			as they are destined to last for ever. But while they are everlasting 
			they are at the same time, as you know, intolerably 
			intense,  unbearably extensive. To bear even the sting of an 
			insect for  all eternity would be a dreadful torment. What must 
			it be, then, to bear the manifold tortures of hell for ever? For 
			ever! For all eternity! Not for a year or for an age but for ever. 
			Try to imagine the awful meaning of this. You have often seen 
			the sand on the seashore. How fine are its tiny grains! And 
			how many of those tiny little grains go to make up the small 
			handful which a child grasps in its play. Now imagine a mountain 
			of that sand, a million miles high, reaching from the earth 
			to the farthest heavens, and a million miles broad, extending 
			to remotest space, and a million miles in thickness: and imagine 
			such an enormous mass of countless particles of sand 
			multiplied as often as there are leaves in the forest, drops of 
			water in the mighty ocean, feathers on birds, scales on fish, 
			hairs on animals, atoms in the vast expanse of the air: and 
			imagine that at  the end of every million years a little bird came 
			to that mountain and carried away in its beak a tiny grain of 
			that sand. How many millions upon millions of centuries 
			would pass before that bird had carried away even a square 
			foot of that mountain, how many eons upon eons of ages 
			before it had carried away all. Yet at the end of that immense 
			stretch of time not even one instant of eternity could be said to 
			have ended. At the end of all those billions and trillions of 
			years eternity would have scarcely begun. And if that mountain 
			rose again after it had been all carried away and if the 
			bird came again and carried it all away again grain by grain: 
			and if it so rose and sank as many times as there are stars in 
			the sky, atoms in the air, drops of water in the sea, leaves on 
			the trees, feathers upon birds, scales upon fish, hairs upon 
			animals, at the end of all those innumerable risings and sinkings 
			of that immeasurably vast mountain not one single instant 
			of eternity could be said to have ended; even then, at the end 
			of such a period, after that eon of time the mere thought of 
			which makes our very brain reel dizzily, eternity would have 
			scarcely begun. </p>
		<p>—A holy saint (one of our own fathers I believe it was) 
			was once vouchsafed a vision of hell. It seemed to him that he 
			stood in the midst of a great hall, dark and silent save for the 
			ticking of a great clock. The ticking went on unceasingly; and 
			it seemed to this saint that the sound of the ticking was the 
			ceaseless repetition of the words: ever, never; ever, never. 
			Ever to be in hell, never to be in heaven; ever to be shut off 
			from the presence of God, never to enjoy the beatific vision; 
			ever to be eaten with flames, gnawed by vermin, goaded with 
			burning spikes, never to be free from those pains; ever to have 
			the conscience upbraid one, the memory enrage, the mind 
			filled with darkness and despair, never to escape; ever to curse 
			and revile the foul demons who gloat fiendishly over the 
			misery of their dupes, never to behold the shining raiment of 
			the blessed spirits; ever to cry out of the abyss of fire to God 
			for an instant, a single instant, of respite from such awful 
			agony, never to receive, even for an instant, God's pardon; 
			ever to suffer, never to enjoy; ever to be damned, never to be 
			saved; ever, never; ever, never. O what a dreadful punishment! 
			An eternity of endless agony, of endless bodily and spiritual 
			torment, without one ray of hope, without one moment of 
			cessation, of agony limitless in extent, limitless in intensity, of 
			torment infinitely lasting, infinitely varied, of torture that 
			sustains eternally that which it eternally devours, of anguish that 
			everlastingly preys upon the spirit while it racks the flesh, an 
			eternity, every instant of which is itself an eternity, and that 
			eternity an eternity of woe. Such is the terrible punishment 
			decreed for those who die in mortal sin by an almighty and 
			a just God. </p>
		<p>—Yes, a just God! Men, reasoning always as men, are 
			astonished that God should mete out an everlasting and 
			infinite punishment in the fires of hell for a single grievous sin. 
			They reason thus because, blinded by the gross illusion of the 
			flesh and the darkness of human understanding, they are 
			unable to comprehend the hideous malice of mortal sin. They 
			reason thus because they are unable to comprehend that even 
			venial sin is of such a foul and hideous nature that even if the 
			omnipotent Creator could end all the evil and misery in the 
			world, the wars, the diseases, the robberies, the crimes, the 
			deaths, the murders, on condition that he allowed a single 
			venial sin to pass unpunished, a single venial sin, a lie, an 
			angry look, a moment of wilful sloth, He, the great omnipotent 
			God, could not do so because sin, be it in thought or deed, 
			is a transgression of His law and God would not be God if He 
			did not punish the transgressor. </p>
		<p>—A sin, an instant of rebellious pride of the intellect, made 
			Lucifer and a third part of the cohorts of angels fall from their 
			glory. A sin, an instant of folly and weakness, drove Adam 
			and Eve out of Eden and brought death and suffering into the 
			world. To retrieve the consequences of that sin the Only 
			Begotten Son of God came down to earth, lived and suffered 
			and died a most painful death, hanging for three hours on the 
			cross. </p>
		<p>—O, my dear little brethren in Christ Jesus, will we then 
			offend that good Redeemer and provoke His anger? Will we 
			trample again upon that torn and mangled corpse? Will we 
			spit upon that face so full of sorrow and love? Will we too, 
			like the cruel jews and the brutal soldiers, mock that gentle 
			and compassionate Saviour Who trod alone for our sake the 
			awful winepress of sorrow? Every word of sin is a wound in 
			His tender side. Every sinful act is a thorn piercing His head. 
			Every impure thought, deliberately yielded to, is a keen lance 
			transfixing that sacred and loving heart. No, no. It is impossible 
			for any human being to do that which offends so deeply 
			the divine majesty, that which is punished by an eternity of 
			agony, that which crucifies again the Son of God and makes 
			a mockery of Him. </p>
		<p>—I pray to God that my poor words may have availed 
			today to confirm in holiness those who are in a state of grace, 
			to strengthen the wavering, to lead back to the state of grace 
			the poor soul that has strayed if any such be among you. I 
			pray to God, and do you pray with me, that we may repent of 
			our sins. I will ask you now, all of you, to repeat after me the 
			act of contrition, kneeling here in this humble chapel in the 
			presence of God. He is there in the tabernacle burning with 
			love for mankind, ready to comfort the afflicted. Be not 
			afraid. No matter how many or how foul the sins if only you 
			repent of them they will be forgiven you. Let no worldly 
			shame hold you back. God is still the merciful Lord Who 
			wishes not the eternal death of the sinner but rather that he be 
			converted and live. </p>
		<p>—He calls you to Him. You are His. He made you out of 
			nothing. He loved you as only a God can love. His arms are 
			open to receive you even though you have sinned against Him. 
			Come to Him, poor sinner, poor vain and erring sinner. Now 
			is the acceptable time. Now is the hour. </p>
		<p>The priest rose and, turning towards the altar, knelt upon 
			the step before the tabernacle in the fallen gloom. He waited 
			till all in the chapel had knelt and every least noise was still. 
			Then, raising his head, he repeated the act of contrition, 
			phrase by phrase, with fervour. The boys answered him 
			phrase by phrase. Stephen, his tongue cleaving to his palate, 
			bowed his head, praying with his heart. </p>

	<div n="3.3" type="section">

		<p>He  went up to his room after dinner in order to be alone 
			with his soul: and at every step his soul seemed  to sigh: at 
			every step his soul mounted with his feet, sighing in the ascent, 
			through a region of viscid gloom. </p>
		<p>He halted on the landing before the door  and then, grasping 
			the porcelain knob, opened the door quickly. He waited in 
			fear, his soul pining within him, praying silently that death 
			might not touch his brow as he passed over the threshold,  that 
			the fiends that inhabit darkness might not be given power over 
			him. He waited still at the threshold  as at the entrance to some 
			dark cave. Faces were there; eyes: they waited and watched. </p>
		<p>—We knew perfectly well of course that although it was 
			bound to come to the light he would find considerable difficulty 
			in endeavouring to try to induce himself to try to endeavour 
			to ascertain the spiritual plenipotentiary and so we knew of 
			course perfectly well - </p>
		<p>Murmuring faces waited and watched;  murmurous voices 
			filled the dark shell of the cave. He feared intensely in spirit 
			and in flesh but, raising his head bravely, he strode into the 
			room firmly. A doorway, a room, the same room, same window. 
			He told himself calmly that those words had absolutely 
			no sense which had seemed to rise murmurously from the 
			dark. He told himself that it was simply his room with the 
			door open. </p>
		<p>He closed the door and, walking swiftly to the bed, knelt 
			beside it and covered his face with his hands. His hands were 
			cold and damp and his limbs ached with chill. Bodily unrest 
			and chill and weariness beset him, routing his thoughts. Why 
			was he kneeling there like a child saying his evening prayers? 
			To be alone with his soul, to examine his conscience, to meet 
			his sins face to face, to recall their times and manners and 
			circumstances, to weep over them. He could not weep. He could 
			not summon them to his memory. He felt only an ache of soul 
			and body, his whole being, memory, will, understanding, flesh, 
			benumbed and weary. </p>
		<p>That was the work of devils, to scatter his thoughts and 
			overcloud his conscience, assailing him at the gates of the 
			cowardly and sincorrupted flesh: and, praying God timidly to 
			forgive him his weakness, he crawled up on to the bed and, 
			wrapping the blankets closely about him, covered his face 
			again with his hands. He had  sinned. He had sinned so deeply 
			against heaven and before God that he was not worthy to be 
			called God's child. </p>
		<p>Could it be that he, Stephen Dedalus, had done those 
			things? His conscience sighed in answer. Yes, he had done 
			them, secretly, filthily, time after time, and, hardened in sinful 
			impenitence, he had dared to wear the mask of holiness before 
			the tabernacle itself while his soul within was a living mass of 
			corruption. How came it that God had not struck him dead? 
			The leprous company of his sins closed about him, breathing 
			upon him, bending over him from all sides. He strove to forget 
			them in an act of prayer, huddling his limbs closer  together 
			and binding down his eyelids: but the senses of his soul would 
			not be bound and, though his eyes were shut fast, he saw the 
			places where he had sinned and, though his ears were tightly 
			covered, he heard. He desired with all his will not to hear or 
			see. He desired till his frame shook under the strain of his 
			desire and until the senses of his soul closed. They closed for 
			an instant and then opened. He saw. </p>
		<p>A field of stiff weeds and thistles and tufted nettlebunches. 
			Thick among the tufts of rank stiff growth lay battered canisters 
			and clots and coils of solid excrement. A faint marshlight 
			struggled upwards from all the ordure through the bristling 
			greygreen weeds. An evil smell, faint and foul as the light, 
			curled upwards sluggishly out of the canisters and from the 
			stale crusted dung. </p>
		<p>Creatures were in the field; one, three, six: creatures were 
			moving in the field, hither and thither. Goatish creatures with 
			human faces, hornybrowed, lightly bearded and grey as indiarubber. 
			The malice of evil glittered in their hard eyes, as they 
			moved hither and thither, trailing their long tails behind them. 
			A rictus of cruel malignity lit up greyly their old bony faces. 
			One was clasping about his ribs a torn flannel waistcoat, 
			another complained monotonously as his beard stuck in the 
			tufted weeds. Soft language issued from their spittleless lips as 
			they swished in slow circles round and round the field, winding 
			hither and thither through the weeds, dragging their long tails 
			amid the rattling canisters. They moved in slow circles, circling 
			closer and closer to enclose, to  enclose, soft language 
			issuing from their lips, their long swishing tails  besmeared 
			with stale shite, thrusting upwards their terrific faces ... </p>
		<p>Help! </p>
		<p>He flung the blankets from him madly to free his face and 
			neck. That was his hell. God had allowed him to see the hell 
			reserved for his sins: stinking, bestial, malignant, a hell of 
			lecherous goatish fiends. For him! For him! </p>
		<p>He sprang from the bed, the reeking odour pouring down 
			his throat, clogging and revolting his entrails. Air! The air of 
			heaven! He stumbled towards the window, groaning and 
			almost fainting with sickness. At the washstand a convulsion 
			seized him within; and, clasping his cold forehead wildly, he 
			vomited profusely in agony. </p>
		<p>When the fit had spent itself he walked weakly to the window 
			and, lifting the sash, sat in a corner of the embrasure and 
			leaned his elbow upon the sill. The rain had drawn off; and 
			amid the moving vapours from point to point of light the city 
			was spinning about herself a soft cocoon of yellowish haze. 
			Heaven was still and faintly luminous and the air sweet to 
			breathe, as in a thicket drenched with showers: and amid 
			peace and shimmering lights and quiet fragrance he made a 
			covenant with his heart. </p>
		<p>He prayed: </p>
		<p>—<i>He once had meant to come on earth in heavenly glory</i> 
			<i>but we sinned: and then He could not safely visit us but with a</i> 
			<i>shrouded majesty and a bedimmed radiance for He was God.</i> 
			<i>So He came Himself in weakness not in power and He sent</i> 
			<i>thee, a creature in His stead, with a creature's comeliness and</i> 
			<i>lustre suited to our state. And now thy very face and form,</i> 
			<i>dear mother, speak to us of the Eternal; not like earthly</i> 
			<i>beauty, dangerous to look upon, but like the morning star</i> 
			<i>which is thy emblem, bright and musical, breathing purity,</i> 
			<i>telling of heaven and infusing peace. O harbinger of day! O</i> 
			<i>light of the pilgrim! Lead us still as thou hast led. In the dark</i> 
			<i>night, across the bleak wilderness guide us on to our Lord</i> 
			<i>Jesus, guide us home.</i> </p>
		<p>His eyes were dimmed with tears and, looking humbly up to 
			heaven, he wept for the innocence he had lost. </p>
		<p>When evening had fallen he left the house and the first 
			touch of the damp dark air and the noise of the door as it 
			closed behind him made ache again his conscience, lulled by 
			prayer and tears. Confess! Confess! It was not enough to lull 
			the conscience with a tear and a prayer. He had to kneel 
			before the minister of the Holy Ghost and tell over his hidden 
			sins truly and repentantly. Before he heard again the footboard 
			of the housedoor trail over the threshold  as it opened to 
			let him in, before he saw again the table in the kitchen set for 
			supper he would have knelt and confessed. It was quite simple. </p>
		<p>The ache of conscience ceased and he walked onward 
			swiftly through the dark streets. There were so many flagstones 
			on the footpath of that street and so many streets in that 
			city and so many cities in the world. Yet eternity had no end. 
			He was in mortal sin. Even once was a mortal sin. It could 
			happen in an instant. But how so quickly? By seeing or by 
			thinking of seeing. The eyes see the thing, without having 
			wished first to see. Then in an instant it happens. But does 
			that part of the body understand or what? The serpent, the 
			most subtle beast of the field. It must understand when it 
			desires in one instant and then prolongs its own desire instant 
			after instant, sinfully. It feels and understands and desires. 
			What a horrible thing! Who made it to be like that, a bestial 
			part of the body able to understand bestially and desire 
			bestially? Was that then he or an inhuman thing moved by a 
			lower soul than his soul? His soul sickened at the thought of a 
			torpid snaky life feeding itself out of the tender marrow of his 
			life and fattening upon the slime of lust. O why was that so? O 
			why? </p>
		<p>He cowered in the shadow of the thought, abasing himself 
			in the awe of God  Who had made all things and all men. 
			Madness. Who could think such a thought? And, cowering in 
			darkness and abject, he prayed mutely to his angel guardian to 
			drive away with his sword the demon that was whispering to 
			his brain. </p>
		<p>The whisper ceased and he knew then clearly that his own 
			soul had sinned in thought and word and deed wilfully 
			through his own body. Confess! He had to confess every sin. 
			How could he utter in words to the priest what he had done? 
			Must, must. Or how could he explain without dying of 
			shame? Or how could he have done such things without 
			shame? A madman, a loathsome madman! Confess! O he 
			would indeed to be free and sinless again! Perhaps the priest 
			would know. O dear God! </p>
		<p>He walked on and on through illlit  streets, fearing to stand 
			still for a moment lest it might seem that he held back from 
			what awaited him, fearing to arrive at that towards which he 
			still turned with longing. How beautiful must be a soul in the 
			state of grace when God looked upon it with love! </p>
		<p>Frowsy girls sat along the curbstones before their baskets. 
			Their dank hair hung trailed  over their brows. They 
			were not beautiful to see as they crouched in the mire. But 
			their souls were seen by God; and if their souls were in a state 
			of grace they were radiant to see: and God loved them, seeing 
			them. </p>
		<p>A wasting breath of humiliation blew bleakly over his soul 
			to think of how he had fallen, to feel that those souls were 
			dearer to God than his. The wind blew over him and passed 
			on to the myriads and myriads of other souls on whom God's 
			favour shone now  more and now less, stars now brighter and 
			now dimmer, sustained  and failing. And the glimmering souls 
			passed away, sustained and failing, merged in a moving 
			breath. One soul was lost; a tiny soul: his. It flickered once 
			and went out, forgotten, lost. The end: black cold void waste. </p>
		<p>Consciousness of place came ebbing back to him slowly 
			over a vast tract of time unlit, unfelt, unlived. The squalid 
			scene composed itself around him; the common accents, the 
			burning gasjets in the shops, odours of fish and spirits and wet 
			sawdust, moving men and women. An old woman was about 
			to cross the street, an oilcan in her hand. He bent down and 
			asked her was there a chapel near. </p>
		<p>—A chapel, sir? Yes, sir. Church Street chapel. </p>
		<p>—Church? </p>
		<p>She  shifted the can to her other hand and directed him: 
			and, as she held out her reeking withered right hand under its 
			fringe of shawl, he bent lower towards her, saddened and 
			soothed by her voice. </p>
		<p>—Thank you. </p>
		<p>—You are quite  welcome, sir. </p>
		<p>The candles on the high altar had been extinguished but the 
			fragrance of incense still floated down the dim nave. Bearded 
			workmen with pious faces were guiding a canopy out through 
			a sidedoor, the sacristan aiding them with quiet gestures and 
			words. A few of the faithful still lingered, praying before one 
			of the sidealtars or kneeling in the benches near the confessionals. 
			He approached timidly and knelt at the last bench in 
			the body, thankful for the peace and silence and fragrant 
			shadow of the church. The board on which he knelt was 
			narrow and worn and those who knelt near him were humble 
			followers of Jesus. Jesus too had been born in poverty and had 
			worked in the shop of a carpenter, cutting boards and planing 
			them, and had first spoken of the kingdom of God to poor 
			fishermen, teaching all men to be meek and humble of heart. </p>
		<p>He bowed his head upon his hands, bidding his heart be 
			meek and humble that he might be like those who knelt beside 
			him and his prayer as acceptable as theirs. He prayed beside 
			them but it was hard. His soul was foul with sin and he dared 
			not ask forgiveness with the simple trust of those whom Jesus, 
			in the mysterious ways of God, had called first to His side, the 
			carpenters, the fishermen, poor and simple people  following a 
			lowly trade, handling and shaping the wood of trees, mending 
			their nets with patience. </p>
		<p>A tall figure came down the aisle and the penitents stirred: 
			and at the last moment, glancing up swiftly, he saw a long grey 
			beard and the brown habit of a capuchin. The priest entered 
			the box and was hidden. Two penitents rose and entered the 
			confessional at either side. The wooden slide was drawn back 
			and the faint murmur of a voice troubled the silence. </p>
		<p>His blood began to murmur in his veins, murmuring like a 
			sinful city summoned from its sleep to hear its doom. Little 
			flakes of fire fell and powdery ashes fell softly, alighting on the 
			houses of men. They stirred, waking from sleep, troubled by 
			the heated air. </p>
		<p>The slide was shot back. The penitent emerged from the 
			side of the box. The farther slide was drawn. A woman entered 
			quietly and deftly where the first penitent had knelt. The 
			faint murmur began again. </p>
		<p>He could still leave the chapel. He could stand up, put one 
			foot before the other and walk out softly and then run, run, 
			run swiftly through the dark streets. He could still escape from 
			the shame. Had it been any terrible crime but that one sin! Had 
			it been murder! Little fiery flakes fell and touched him at all 
			points, shameful thoughts, shameful words, shameful acts. 
			Shame covered him wholly like fine glowing ashes falling 
			continually. To say it in words! His soul, stifling and helpless, 
			would cease to be. </p>
		<p>The slide was shot back. A penitent emerged from the 
			farther side of the box. The near slide was drawn. A penitent 
			entered where the other penitent had come out. A soft whispering 
			noise floated in vaporous cloudlets out of the box. It 
			was the woman: soft whispering cloudlets, soft whispering 
			vapour, whispering and vanishing. </p>
		<p>He beat his breast with his fist humbly, secretly under cover 
			of the wooden armrest. He would be at one with others and 
			with God. He would love his neighbour. He would love God 
			who had made and loved him. He would kneel and pray with 
			others and be happy. God would look down on him and on 
			them and would love them all. </p>
		<p>It was easy to be good. God's yoke was sweet and light. It 
			was better never to have sinned, to have remained always a 
			child, for God loved little children and suffered them to come 
			to Him. It was a terrible and a sad thing to sin. But God was 
			merciful to poor sinners who were truly sorry. How true that 
			was! That was indeed goodness. </p>
		<p>The slide was shot to suddenly. The penitent came out. He 
			was next. He stood up in terror and walked blindly into the 
			box. </p>
		<p>At last it had come. He knelt in the silent gloom and raised 
			his eyes to the white crucifix suspended above him. God 
			could see that he was sorry. He would tell all his sins. His 
			confession would be long, long. Everybody in the chapel 
			would know then what a sinner he had been. Let them know. 
			It was true. But God had promised to forgive him if he was 
			sorry. He was sorry. He clasped his hands and raised them 
			towards the white form, praying with his darkened eyes, 
			praying with all his trembling body, swaying his head to and 
			fro like a lost creature, praying with whimpering lips. </p>
		<p>—Sorry! Sorry! O sorry! </p>
		<p>The slide clicked back and his heart bounded in his breast. 
			The face of an old priest was at the grating, averted from him, 
			leaning upon a hand. He made the sign of the cross and 
			prayed of the priest to bless him for he had sinned. Then, 
			bowing his head, he repeated the <seg xml:lang="lat">></seg> in fright. At the 
			words <hi rend="italic">my most grievous fault</hi> he ceased, breathless. </p>
		<p>—How long is it since your last confession, my child? </p>
		<p>—A long time, father. </p>
		<p>—A month, my child? </p>
		<p>—Longer, father. </p>
		<p>—Three months, my child? </p>
		<p>—Longer, father. </p>
		<p>—Six months? </p>
		<p>—Eight months, father. </p>
		<p>He had begun. The priest asked: </p>
		<p>—And what do you remember since that time? </p>
		<p>He began to confess his sins: masses missed,  prayers not 
			said, lies. </p>
		<p>—Anything else, my child? </p>
		<p>Sins of anger, envy of  others, gluttony, vanity, disobedience. </p>
		<p>—Anything else, my child? </p>
		<p>—Sloth. </p>
		<p>—Anything else, my child? </p>
		<p>There was no help. He murmured: </p>
		<p>—I ... committed sins of impurity, father. </p>
		<p>The priest did not turn his head. </p>
		<p>—With yourself, my child? </p>
		<p>—And ... with others. </p>
		<p>—With women, my child? </p>
		<p>—Yes, father. </p>
		<p>—Were  they married women, my child? </p>
		<p>He did not know. His sins trickled from his lips, one by one, 
			trickled in shameful drops from his soul festering and oozing 
			like a sore, a squalid stream of vice. The last sins oozed 
			forth, sluggish, filthy. There was no more to tell. He bowed his 
			head, overcome. </p>
		<p>The priest was silent. Then he asked: </p>
		<p>—How old are you, my child? </p>
		<p>—Sixteen, father. </p>
		<p>The priest passed his hand several times over his face. 
			Then, resting his forehead against his hand, he leaned towards 
			the grating and, with eyes still averted, spoke slowly. His voice 
			was weary and old. </p>
		<p>—You are very young, my child, he said, and let me implore 
			of you to give up that sin. It is a terrible sin. It kills the 
			body and it kills the soul. It is the cause of many crimes and 
			misfortunes. Give it up, my child, for God's sake. It is 
			dishonourable and unmanly. You cannot know where that wretched 
			habit will lead you or where it will come against you. As long 
			as you commit that sin, my poor child, you will never be worth 
			one farthing to God. Pray to our mother Mary to help you. 
			She will help you, my child. Pray to Our Blessed Lady when 
			that sin comes into  your mind. I am sure you will do that, will 
			you not? You repent of all those sins. I am sure you do. And 
			you will promise God now that by His holy grace you will 
			never offend Him any more by that wicked sin. You will make 
			that solemn promise to God, will you not? </p>
		<p>—Yes, father. </p>
		<p>The old and weary voice fell like sweet rain upon his quaking 
			parching heart. How sweet and sad! </p>
		<p>—Do so, my poor child. The devil has  led you astray. Drive 
			him back to hell when he tempts you to dishonour your body 
			in that way - the foul spirit who hates Our Lord. Promise God 
			now that you will give up that sin, that wretched wretched sin. </p>
		<p>Blinded by his tears and by the light of God's mercifulness 
			he bent his head and heard the grave words of absolution 
			spoken and saw the priest's hand raised above him in token 
			of forgiveness. </p>
		<p>—God bless you, my child. Pray for me. </p>
		<p>He knelt to say his penance, praying in a corner of the dark 
			nave: and his prayers ascended to heaven from his purified 
			heart like perfume streaming upwards from a heart of white 
			rose. </p>
		<p>The  muddy streets were gay. He strode homeward, conscious 
			of an  invisible grace pervading and making light his 
			limbs. In spite of all he had done it. He had confessed and 
			God had pardoned him. His soul was made fair and holy once 
			more, holy and happy. </p>
		<p>It would be beautiful to die if God so willed. It was beautiful 
			to live if God so willed, to live in grace a life of peace and 
			virtue and forbearance with others. </p>
		<p>He sat by the fire in the kitchen, not daring to speak for 
			happiness. Till that moment he had not known how beautiful 
			and peaceful life could be. The green square of paper pinned 
			round the lamp cast down a tender shade. On the dresser was 
			a plate of sausages and white pudding and on the shelf there 
			were eggs. They would be for the breakfast in the morning 
			after the communion in the college chapel. White pudding and 
			eggs and sausages and cups of tea. How simple and beautiful 
			was life after all! And life lay all before him. </p>
		<p>In a dream he fell asleep. In a dream he rose and saw that it 
			was morning. In a waking dream he went through the quiet 
			morning  towards the college. </p>
		<p>The boys were all there, kneeling in their places. He knelt 
			among them, happy and shy. The altar was heaped with 
			fragrant masses of white flowers: and in the morning light the 
			pale flames of the candles among the white flowers were clear 
			and silent as his own soul. </p>
		<p>He knelt before the altar with his classmates, holding the 
			altar cloth with them over a living rail of hands. His hands 
			were trembling, and his soul trembled as he heard the priest 
			pass with the ciborium from communicant to communicant. </p>
		<p>—<i>Corpus Domini nostri.</i> </p>
		<p>Could it be? He knelt there sinless and timid: and he would 
			hold upon his tongue the host and God would enter his 
			purified body. </p>
		<p>—<i>In vitam eternam. Amen.</i> </p>
		<p>Another life! A life of grace and virtue and happiness! It 
			was true. It was not a dream from which he would wake.  The 
			past was past. </p>
		<p>—<i>Corpus Domini nostri.</i> </p>
		<p>The ciborium had come to him. </p>

		<p>Sunday was dedicated to the mystery of the Holy 
			Trinity, Monday to the Holy Ghost, Tuesday to the 
			Guardian Angels, Wednesday to Saint Joseph, Thursday to 
			the Most Blessed Sacrament of the Altar, Friday to the 
			Suffering Jesus, Saturday to the Blessed Virgin Mary. </p>
		<p>Every morning he hallowed himself anew in the presence of 
			some holy image or mystery. His day began with an heroic 
			offering of its every moment of thought or action for the 
			intentions of the sovereign pontiff and with an early mass. The 
			raw morning air whetted his resolute piety; and often as he 
			knelt among the few worshippers at the sidealtar, following 
			with his interleaved prayerbook the murmur of the priest, he 
			glanced up for an instant towards the vested figure standing in 
			the gloom between the two candles which were the old and the 
			new testaments and imagined that he was kneeling at mass in 
			the catacombs. </p>
		<p>His daily life was laid out in devotional areas. By means of 
			ejaculations and prayers he stored up ungrudgingly for the 
			souls in purgatory centuries of days and quarantines and 
			years; yet the spiritual triumph which he felt in achieving with 
			ease so many fabulous ages of canonical penances did not 
			wholly reward his zeal of prayer since he could never know 
			how much temporal punishment he had remitted by way of 
			suffrage for the agonising souls: and, fearful lest in the midst 
			of the purgatorial fire, which differed from the infernal only in 
			that it was not everlasting, his penance might avail no more 
			than a drop of moisture, he drove his soul daily through an 
			increasing circle of works of supererogation. </p>
		<p>Every part of his day, divided by what he regarded now as 
			the duties of his station in life, circled about its own centre of 
			spiritual energy. His life seemed to have drawn near to eternity; 
			every thought, word and deed, every instance of consciousness 
			could be made to revibrate radiantly in heaven: 
			and at times his sense of such immediate repercussion was so 
			lively that he seemed to feel his soul in devotion pressing like 
			fingers the keyboard of a great cash register and to see the 
			amount of his purchase start forth immediately in heaven, not 
			as a number but as a frail column of incense or as a slender 
			flower. </p>
		<p>The rosaries too which he said constantly - for he carried 
			his beads loose in his trousers' pockets that he might tell them 
			as he walked the streets - transformed themselves into coronals 
			of flowers of such vague unearthly texture that they 
			seemed to him as hueless and odourless as they were nameless. 
			He offered up each of his three daily chaplets that his 
			soul might grow strong in each of the three theological virtues, 
			in faith in the Father, Who had created him, in hope in the 
			Son Who had redeemed him, and in love of the Holy Ghost 
			Who had sanctified him, and this thrice triple prayer he offered 
			to the Three persons through Mary in the name of her 
			joyful and sorrowful and glorious  mysteries. </p>
		<p>On each of the seven days of the week he further prayed 
			that one of the seven gifts of the Holy Ghost might descend 
			upon his soul and drive out of it day by day the seven deadly 
			sins which had defiled it in the past; and he prayed for each 
			gift on its appointed day, confident that it would descend upon 
			him, though it seemed strange to him at times that wisdom 
			and understanding and knowledge were so distinct in their 
			nature that each should be prayed for apart from the others. 
			Yet he believed that at some future stage of his spiritual 
			progress this difficulty would be removed when his sinful soul 
			had been raised up from its weakness and enlightened by the 
			Third Person of the Most Blessed Trinity. He believed this all 
			the more, and with trepidation, because of the divine gloom 
			and silence wherein dwelt the unseen Paraclete, Whose symbols 
			were a dove and a mighty wind, to sin against Whom was 
			a sin beyond forgiveness, the eternal, mysterious secret Being 
			to Whom, as God, the priests offered up mass once a year, 
			robed in the scarlet of the tongues of fire. </p>
		<p>The imagery through which the nature and kinship of the 
			Three Persons of the Trinity were darkly shadowed forth in 
			the books of devotion which he read - the Father contemplating 
			from all eternity as in a mirror His Divine Perfections and 
			thereby begetting eternally the Eternal Son and the Holy Spirit 
			proceeding out of Father and Son from all eternity - were 
			easier of acceptance by his mind by reason of their august 
			incomprehensibility than was the simple fact that God had 
			loved his soul from all eternity, for ages before he had been 
			born into the world, for ages before the world itself had existed. </p>
		<p>He had heard the names of the passions of love and hate 
			pronounced solemnly on the stage and in the pulpit, had found 
			them set forth solemnly in books, and had wondered why his 
			soul was unable to harbour them for any time or to force his 
			lips to utter their names with conviction. A brief anger had 
			often invested him but he had never been able to make it an 
			abiding passion and had always felt himself passing out of it as 
			if his very body were being divested with ease of some outer 
			skin or peel. He had felt a subtle, dark and murmurous presence 
			penetrate his being and fire him with a brief iniquitous 
			lust: it too had slipped beyond his grasp leaving his mind lucid 
			and indifferent. This, it seemed, was the only love and that the 
			only hate his soul would harbour. </p>
		<p>But he could no longer disbelieve in the reality of love since 
			God Himself had loved his individual  soul with divine love 
			from all eternity. Gradually, as his soul was enriched with 
			spiritual knowledge, he saw the whole world forming one vast 
			symmetrical expression of God's power and love. Life became 
			a divine gift for every moment and sensation of which, were it 
			even the sight of a single leaf hanging on the twig of a tree, his 
			soul should praise and thank the Giver. The world for all its 
			solid substance and complexity no longer existed for his soul 
			save as a theorem of divine power and love and universality. 
			So entire and unquestionable was this sense of the divine 
			meaning in all nature granted to his soul that he could scarcely 
			understand why it was in any way necessary that he should 
			continue to live. Yet that was part of the divine purpose and 
			he dared not question its use, he above all others who had 
			sinned so deeply and so foully against the divine purpose. 
			Meek and abased by this consciousness of the one eternal 
			omnipresent perfect reality his soul took up again her burden 
			of pieties, masses and prayers and sacraments and mortifications, 
			and only then for the first time since he had 
			brooded on the great mystery of love did he feel within him a 
			warm movement like that of some newly born life or virtue of 
			the soul itself. The attitude of rapture in sacred art, the raised 
			and parted hands, the parted lips and eyes as of one about to 
			swoon, became for him an image of the soul in prayer, humiliated 
			and faint before her Creator. </p>
		<p>But he had been forewarned of the dangers of spiritual 
			exaltation and did not allow himself to desist from even the 
			least or lowliest devotion,  striving also by constant mortification 
			to undo the sinful past rather than to achieve a 
			saintliness fraught with peril. Each of his senses was brought 
			under a rigorous discipline. In order to mortify the sense of 
			sight he made it his rule to walk in the street with downcast 
			eyes, glancing neither to right nor left and never behind him. 
			His eyes shunned every encounter with the eyes of women. 
			From time to time also he balked them by a sudden effort of 
			the will, as by lifting them suddenly in the middle of an 
			unfinished sentence and closing the book. To mortify his 
			hearing he exerted no control over his voice which was then 
			breaking, neither sang nor whistled and made no attempt to 
			flee from noises which caused him painful nervous irritation 
			such as the sharpening of knives on the knifeboard, the 
			gathering of cinders on the fireshovel and the twigging of the 
			carpet. To mortify his smell was more difficult as he found in 
			himself no instinctive repugnance to bad odours, whether they 
			were the odours of the outdoor world such as those of dung 
			and tar or the odours of his own person among which he had 
			made many curious comparisons and experiments. He found 
			in the end that the only odour against which his sense of smell 
			revolted was a certain stale fishy stink like that of longstanding 
			urine: and whenever it was possible he subjected himself to 
			this unpleasant odour. To mortify the taste he practised strict 
			habits at table, observed to the letter all the fasts of the church 
			and sought by distraction to divert his mind from the savours 
			of different foods. But it was to the mortification of touch that 
			he brought the most assiduous ingenuity of inventiveness. He 
			never consciously changed his position in bed, sat in the most 
			uncomfortable positions, suffered patiently every itch and 
			pain, kept away from the fire, remained on his knees all 
			through the mass except at the gospels, left parts of his neck 
			and face undried so that air might sting them and, whenever 
			he was not saying his beads, carried his arms stiffly at his 
			sides like a runner and never in his pockets or clasped behind 
			him. </p>
		<p>He had no temptations to sin mortally. It surprised him 
			however to find that at the end of his course of intricate piety 
			and selfrestraint he was so easily at the mercy of childish and 
			unworthy imperfections. His prayers and fasts availed him 
			little for the suppression of anger at hearing his mother sneeze 
			or at being disturbed in his devotions. It needed an immense 
			effort of his will to master the impulse which urged him to give 
			outlet to such irritation. Images of the outbursts of trivial 
			anger which he had often noted among his masters, their 
			twitching mouths, closeshut lips and flushed cheeks, recurred 
			to his memory, discouraging him, for all his practice of humility, 
			by the comparison. To merge his life in the common tide 
			of other lives was harder for him than any fasting or prayer, 
			and it was his constant failure to do this to his own satisfaction 
			which caused in his soul at last a sensation of spiritual dryness 
			together with a growth of doubts and  scruples. His soul traversed 
			a period of desolation in which the sacraments themselves 
			seemed to have turned into dried up sources. His 
			confession became a channel for the escape of scrupulous and 
			unrepented imperfections. His actual reception of the eucharist 
			did not bring him the same dissolving moments of 
			virginal selfsurrender as did those spiritual communions made 
			by him sometimes at the close of some visit to the Blessed 
			Sacrament. The book which he used for these visits was an old 
			neglected book written by saint Alphonsus Liguori, with 
			fading characters and sere foxpapered leaves. A faded world 
			of fervent love and virginal responses seemed to be evoked for 
			his soul by the reading of its pages in which the imagery of the 
			canticles was interwoven with the communicant's prayers. An 
			inaudible voice seemed to caress the soul, telling her names 
			and glories, bidding her arise as for espousal and come away, 
			bidding her look forth, a spouse, from Amana and from the 
			mountains of the leopards; and the soul seemed to answer 
			with the same inaudible voice, surrendering herself: <seg xml:lang="lat"><hi rend="italic">Inter 
				ubera mea commorabitur</hi></seg>. </p>
		<p>This idea of surrender had a perilous attraction for his mind 
			now that he felt his soul beset once again by the insistent 
			voices of the flesh which began to murmur to him again during 
			his prayers and meditations. It gave him an intense sense of 
			power to know that he  could by a single act of consent, in a 
			moment of thought, undo all that he had done. He seemed to 
			feel a flood slowly advancing towards his naked feet and to be 
			waiting for the first faint timid noiseless wavelet to touch his 
			fevered skin. Then, almost at the instant of that touch, almost 
			at the verge of sinful consent, he found himself standing far 
			away from the flood upon a dry shore, saved by a sudden act 
			of the will or a sudden ejaculation: and, seeing the silver line 
			of the flood far away and beginning again its slow advance 
			towards his feet, a new thrill of power and satisfaction shook 
			his soul to know that he had not yielded nor undone all. </p>
		<p>When he had eluded the flood of temptation many times in 
			this way he grew troubled and wondered whether the grace 
			which he had refused to lose was not being filched from him 
			little by little. The clear certitude of his own immunity grew 
			dim and to it succeeded a vague fear that his soul had really 
			fallen unawares. It was with difficulty that he won back his old 
			consciousness of his state of grace by telling himself that he 
			had prayed to God at every temptation and that the grace 
			which he had prayed for must have been given to him inasmuch 
			as God was obliged to give it. The very frequency and 
			violence of temptations showed him at last the truth of what 
			he had heard about the trials of the saints. Frequent and 
			violent temptations were a proof that the citadel of the soul 
			had not fallen and that the devil raged to make it fall. </p>
		<p>Often when he had confessed his doubts and scruples, some 
			momentary inattention at prayer, a movement of trivial anger 
			in his soul or a subtle wilfulness in speech or act, he was 
			bidden by his confessor to name some sin of his past life 
			before absolution was given him. He named it with humility 
			and shame and repented of it once more. It humiliated and 
			shamed him to think that he would never be freed from it 
			wholly, however holily he might live or whatever virtues or 
			perfections he might attain. A restless feeling of guilt would 
			always be present with him: he would confess and repent and 
			be absolved, confess and repent again and be absolved again, 
			fruitlessly. Perhaps that first hasty confession wrung from him 
			by the fear of hell had not been good? Perhaps, concerned 
			only for his imminent doom, he had not had sincere sorrow 
			for his sin? But the surest sign that his confession had been 
			good and that he had had sincere sorrow for his sin was, he 
			knew, the amendment of his life. </p>
		<p>—I have amended  my life, have I not? he asked himself. </p>

		<p>The director stood in the embrasure of the window, his 
			back to the light, leaning an elbow on the brown crossblind 
			and, as he spoke and smiled, slowly dangling and looping the 
			cord of the other blind. Stephen stood before him, following 
			for a moment with his eyes the waning of the long summer 
			daylight above the roofs or the slow deft movements of the 
			priestly fingers. The priest's face was in total shadow but the 
			waning daylight from behind him touched the deeply grooved 
			temples and the curves of the skull. Stephen followed also 
			with his ears the accents and intervals of the priest's voice as 
			he spoke gravely and cordially of indifferent themes, the 
			vacation which had just ended, the colleges of the order 
			abroad, the transference of masters. The grave and cordial 
			voice went on easily with its tale, and in the pauses Stephen 
			felt bound to set it on again with respectful questions. He knew 
			that the tale was a prelude and his mind waited for the sequel. 
			Ever since the message of summons had come for him from 
			the director his mind had struggled to find the meaning of the 
			message; and during the long restless time he had sat in the 
			college parlour waiting for the director to come in his eyes had 
			wandered from one sober picture to another around the walls 
			and his mind wandered from one guess to another until the 
			meaning of the summons had almost become clear. Then, just 
			as he was wishing that some unforeseen cause might prevent 
			the director from coming, he had heard the handle of the door 
			turning and the swish of a soutane. </p>
		<p>The director had begun to speak of the dominican and 
			franciscan orders and of the friendship between saint Thomas 
			and saint Bonaventure. The capuchin dress, he thought, was 
			rather too  ... </p>
		<p>Stephen's face gave back the priest's indulgent smile and, not 
			being anxious to give an opinion, he made a slight dubitative 
			movement with his lips. </p>
		<p>—I believe, continued the director, that there is some talk 
			now among the capuchins themselves of doing away with it 
			and following the example of the other franciscans. </p>
		<p>—I suppose they would retain it in the cloister, said Stephen. </p>
		<p>—O, certainly, said the director. For the cloister it is all 
			right but for the street I really think it would be better to do 
			away with, don't you? </p>
		<p>—It must be troublesome, I imagine? </p>
		<p>—Of course it is, of course. Just imagine when I was in 
			Belgium I used to see them out cycling in all kinds of weather 
			with this thing up about their knees! It was really ridiculous. 
			<i>Les jupes</i>, they call them in Belgium. </p>
		<p>The vowel was so modified as to be indistinct. </p>
		<p>—What do they call them? </p>
		<p>—<i>Les jupes.</i> </p>
		<p>—O. </p>
		<p>Stephen smiled again in answer to the smile which he could 
			not see on the priest's shadowed face, its image or spectre only 
			passing rapidly across his mind as the low discreet accent fell 
			upon his ear. He gazed calmly before him at the waning sky, 
			glad of the cool of the evening and the faint yellow glow which 
			hid the tiny flame kindling upon his cheek. </p>
		<p>The names of articles of dress worn by women or of certain 
			soft and delicate stuffs used in their making brought always to 
			his mind a delicate and sinful perfume. As a boy he had imagined 
			the reins by which horses are driven as slender silken 
			bands and it shocked him to feel at Stradbrook the greasy 
			leather of harness. It had shocked him too when he had felt 
			for the first time beneath his tremulous fingers the brittle 
			texture of a woman's stocking for, retaining nothing of all he 
			read save that which seemed to him an echo or a prophecy of 
			his own state, it was only amid softworded phrases or within 
			rosesoft stuffs that he dared to conceive of the soul or body of 
			a woman moving with tender life. </p>
		<p>But the phrase on the priest's lips was disingenuous for he 
			knew that a priest should not speak lightly on that theme. The 
			phrase had been spoken lightly with design and he felt that his 
			face was being searched by the eyes in the shadow. Whatever 
			he had heard or read of the craft of jesuits he had put aside 
			frankly as not borne out by his own experience. His masters, 
			even when they had not attracted him, had seemed to him 
			always intelligent and serious priests, athletic and highspirited 
			prefects. He thought of them as men who washed their bodies 
			briskly with cold water and wore clean cold linen. During all 
			the years he had lived among them in Clongowes and in 
			Belvedere he had received only two pandies and, though these 
			had been dealt him in the wrong, he knew that he had often 
			escaped punishment. During all those years he had never 
			heard from any of his masters a flippant word: it was they 
			who had taught him christian doctrine and urged him to live a 
			good life and, when he had fallen into grievous sin, it was they 
			who had led him back to grace. Their presence had made him 
			diffident of himself when he was a muff in Clongowes and it 
			had made him diffident of himself also while he had held his 
			equivocal position in Belvedere. A constant sense of this had 
			remained with him up to the last year of his school life. He 
			had never once disobeyed or allowed turbulent companions to 
			seduce him from his habit of quiet obedience: and, even when 
			he doubted some statement of a master, he had never presumed 
			to doubt openly. Lately some of their judgments had 
			sounded a little childish in his ears and had made him feel a 
			regret and pity as though he were slowly passing out of an 
			accustomed world and were hearing its language for the last 
			time. One day when some boys had gathered round a priest 
			under the shed near the chapel, he had heard the priest say: </p>
		<p>—I believe that Lord Macaulay was a man who probably 
			never committed a mortal sin in his life, that is to say, a 
			deliberate mortal sin. </p>
		<p>Some of the boys had then asked the priest if Victor Hugo 
			were not the greatest French writer. The priest had answered 
			that Victor Hugo had never written half so well when he had 
			turned against the church as he had written when he was a 
			catholic. </p>
		<p>—But there are many eminent French critics, said the 
			priest, who consider that even Victor Hugo, great as he certainly 
			was, had not so pure a French style as Louis Veuillot. </p>
		<p>The tiny flame which the priest's allusion had kindled upon 
			Stephen's cheek had sunk down again and his eyes were still 
			fixed calmly on the colorless sky. But an unresting doubt flew 
			hither and thither before his mind. Masked memories passed 
			quickly before him: he recognised scenes and persons yet he 
			was conscious that he had failed to perceive some vital circumstance 
			in them. He saw himself walking about the grounds 
			watching the sports in Clongowes and eating slim jim out of 
			his cricketcap. Some jesuits were walking round the cycletrack 
			in the company of ladies. The echoes of certain expressions 
			used in Clongowes sounded in remote caves of his mind. </p>
		<p>His ears were listening to these distant echoes amid the 
			silence of the parlour when he became aware that the priest 
			was addressing him in a different voice. </p>
		<p>—I sent for you today, Stephen, because I wished to speak 
			to you on a very important subject. </p>
		<p>—Yes, sir. </p>
		<p>—Have you ever felt that you had a vocation? </p>
		<p>Stephen parted his lips to answer yes and then withheld the 
			word suddenly. The priest waited for the answer and added: </p>
		<p>—I mean have you ever felt within yourself, in your soul, a 
			desire to join the order. Think. </p>
		<p>—I have sometimes thought of it, said Stephen. </p>
		<p>The priest let the blindcord fall to one side and, uniting his 
			hands, leaned his chin gravely upon them, communing with 
			himself. </p>
		<p>—In a college like this, he said at length, there is one boy or 
			perhaps two or three boys whom God calls to the religious 
			life. Such a boy is marked off from his companions by his 
			piety, by the good example he shows to others. He is looked 
			up to by them; he is chosen perhaps as prefect by his fellow 
			sodalists. And you, Stephen, have been such a boy in this 
			college, prefect of Our Blessed Lady's sodality. Perhaps you 
			are the boy in this college whom God designs to call to Himself. </p>
		<p>A strong note of pride reinforcing the gravity of the priest's 
			voice made Stephen's heart quicken in response. </p>
		<p>—To receive that call, Stephen, said the priest, is the greatest 
			honour that the Almighty God can bestow upon a man. 
			No king or emperor on this earth has the power of the priest of 
			God. No angel or archangel in heaven, no saint, not even the 
			Blessed Virgin herself has the power of a priest of God: the 
			power of the keys, the power to bind and to loose from sin, 
			the power of exorcism, the power to cast out from the creatures 
			of God the evil spirits that have power over them, the 
			power, the authority, to make the great God of Heaven come 
			down upon the altar and take the form of bread and wine. 
			What an awful power, Stephen! </p>
		<p>A flame began to flutter again on Stephen's cheek as he 
			heard in this proud address an echo of his own proud musings. 
			How often had he seen himself as a priest wielding calmly and 
			humbly the awful power of which angels and saints stood in 
			reverence! His soul had loved to muse in secret on this desire. 
			He had seen himself, a young and silentmannered priest, 
			entering a confessional swiftly, ascending the altarsteps, 
			incensing, genuflecting, accomplishing the vague acts of the 
			priesthood which pleased him by reason of their semblance of 
			reality and of their distance from it. In that dim life which he 
			had lived through in his musings he had assumed the voices 
			and gestures which he had noted with various priests. He had 
			bent his knee sideways like such a one, he had shaken the 
			thurible only slightly like such a one, his chasuble had swung 
			open like that of such another as he had turned to the altar 
			again after having blessed the people. And above all it had 
			pleased him to fill the second place in those dim scenes of his 
			imagining. He shrank from the dignity of celebrant because it 
			displeased him to imagine that all the vague pomp should end 
			in his own person or that the ritual should assign to him so 
			clear and final an office. He longed for the minor sacred 
			offices, to be vested with the tunicle of subdeacon at high 
			mass, to stand aloof from the altar, forgotten by the people, 
			his shoulders covered with a humeral veil, holding the paten 
			within its folds, or, when the sacrifice had  been accomplished, 
			to stand as deacon in a dalmatic of cloth of gold on the step 
			below the celebrant, his hands joined and his face towards the 
			people, and sing the chant <seg xml:lang="lat"><hi rend="italic">Ite, missa est</hi></seg>. If ever he had seen 
			himself celebrant it was as in the pictures of the mass in his 
			child's massbook, in a church without worshippers, save for 
			the angel of the sacrifice, at a bare altar and served by an 
			acolyte scarcely more boyish than himself. In vague sacrificial 
			or sacramental acts alone his will seemed drawn to go forth to 
			encounter reality: and it was partly the absence of an appointed 
			rite which had always constrained him to inaction 
			whether he had allowed silence to cover his anger or pride or 
			had suffered only an embrace he longed to give. </p>
		<p>He listened in reverent silence now to the priest's appeal 
			and through the words he heard even more distinctly a voice 
			bidding him approach, offering him secret knowledge and 
			secret power. He would know then what was the sin  of Simon 
			Magus and what the sin against the Holy Ghost for which 
			there was no forgiveness. He would know obscure things, 
			hidden from others, from those who  were conceived and born 
			children of wrath. He would know the sins, the sinful longings 
			and sinful thoughts and sinful acts, of others, hearing them 
			murmured into his ears in the confessional under the shame of 
			a darkened chapel by the lips of women and of girls: but 
			rendered immune mysteriously at his ordination by the imposition 
			of hands his soul would pass again uncontaminated to 
			the white peace of the altar. No touch of sin would linger upon 
			the hands with which he would elevate and break the host; no 
			touch of sin would linger on his lips in prayer to make him eat 
			and drink damnation to himself, not discerning the body of the 
			Lord. He would hold his secret knowledge and secret power, 
			being as sinless as the innocent: and he would be a priest for 
			ever according to the order of Melchisedec. </p>
		<p>—I will offer up my mass tomorrow morning, said the 
			director, that Almighty God may reveal to you His holy will. 
			And let you, Stephen, make a novena to your holy patron 
			saint, the first martyr, who is very powerful with God, that 
			God may enlighten your mind. But you must be quite sure, 
			Stephen, that you have a vocation because it would be terrible 
			if you found afterwards that you had none. Once a priest 
			always a priest, remember. Your catechism tells you that the 
			sacrament of Holy Orders is one of those which can be received 
			only once because it imprints on the soul an indelible 
			spiritual mark which can never be effaced. It is before you 
			must weigh well, not after. It is a solemn question, Stephen, 
			because on it may depend the salvation of your eternal soul. 
			But we will pray to God together. </p>
		<p>He held open the heavy hall door and gave his hand as if 
			already to a companion in the spiritual life. Stephen passed 
			out on to  the wide platform above the steps and was conscious 
			of the caress of mild evening air. Towards Findlater's church a 
			quartet of young men were striding along with linked arms, 
			swaying their heads and stepping to the agile melody of their 
			leader's concertina. The music passed in an instant, as the first 
			bars of sudden music always did, over the fantastic fabrics of 
			his mind, dissolving them painlessly and noiselessly as a 
			sudden wave dissolves the sandbuilt turrets of children. Smiling 
			at the trivial air he raised his eyes to the priest's face and, 
			seeing in it a mirthless reflection of the sunken day, detached 
			his hand slowly which had acquiesced  faintly in that companionship. </p>
		<p>As he descended the steps the impression which effaced his 
			troubled selfcommunion was that of a mirthless mask 
			reflecting a sunken day from the threshold of the college. The 
			shadow, then, of the life of the college passed gravely over his 
			consciousness. It was a grave and ordered and passionless life 
			that awaited him, a life without material cares. He wondered 
			how he would pass the first night in the novitiate and with 
			what dismay he would wake the first morning in the dormitory. 
			The troubling odour of the long corridors of Clongowes 
			came back to him and he heard the discreet murmur of the 
			burning gasflames. At once from every part of his being unrest 
			began to irradiate. A feverish quickening of his pulses followed 
			and a din of meaningless words drove his reasoned 
			thoughts hither and thither confusedly. His lungs dilated and 
			sank as if he were inhaling a warm moist unsustaining air and 
			he smelt again the warm moist air which hung in the bath in 
			Clongowes above the sluggish turfcoloured water. </p>
		<p>Some instinct, waking at these memories, stronger than 
			education or piety, quickened within him at every near approach 
			to that life, an instinct subtle and hostile, and armed 
			him against acquiescence. The chill and order of the life 
			repelled him. He saw himself rising in the cold of the morning 
			and filing down with the others to early mass and trying vainly 
			to struggle with his prayers against the fainting sickness of his 
			stomach. He saw himself sitting at dinner with the community 
			of a college. What, then, had become of that deeprooted 
			shyness of his which had made him loth to eat or drink under 
			a strange roof? What had come of the pride of his spirit which 
			had always made him conceive himself as a being apart in every 
			order? </p>
		<p>The Reverend Stephen Dedalus, S.J. </p>
		<p>His name in that new life leaped into characters before his 
			eyes and to it there followed a mental sensation of an 
			undefined face or colour of a face. The colour faded and 
			became strong like a changing glow of pallid brick red. Was it 
			the raw reddish glow he had so often seen on wintry mornings 
			on the shaven gills of the priests? The face was eyeless and 
			sourfavoured and devout, shot with pink tinges of suffocated 
			anger. Was it not a mental spectre of the face of one of the 
			jesuits whom some of the boys called Lantern Jaws and others 
			Foxy Campbell? </p>
		<p>He was passing at that moment before the jesuit house in 
			Gardiner Street, and wondered vaguely which window would 
			be his if he ever joined the order. Then he wondered at the 
			vagueness of his wonder, at the remoteness of his soul from 
			what he had hitherto imagined her sanctuary, at the frail hold 
			which so many years of order and obedience had of him when 
			once a definite and irrevocable act of his threatened to end for 
			ever, in time and in eternity, his freedom. The voice of the 
			director urging upon him the proud claims of the church and 
			the mystery and power of the priestly office repeated itself 
			idly in his memory. His soul was not there to hear and greet it 
			and he knew now that the exhortation he had listened to had 
			already fallen into an idle formal tale. He would never swing 
			the thurible  before the tabernacle as priest. His destiny was to 
			be elusive of social or religious orders. The wisdom of the 
			priest's appeal did not touch him to the quick. He was destined 
			to learn his own wisdom apart from others or to learn 
			the wisdom of others himself wandering among the snares of 
			the world. </p>
		<p>The snares of the world were its ways of sin. He would fall. 
			He had not yet fallen but he would fall silently, in an instant. 
			Not to fall was too hard, too hard: and he felt the silent lapse 
			of his soul, as it would be at some instant to come, falling, 
			falling but not yet fallen, still unfallen but about to fall. </p>
		<p>He crossed the bridge over the stream of the Tolka and 
			turned his eyes coldly for an instant towards the faded blue 
			shrine of the Blessed Virgin which stood fowlwise on a pole in 
			the middle of a hamshaped encampment of poor cottages. 
			Then, bending to the left, he followed the lane which led up to 
			his house. The faint sour stink of rotted cabbages came towards 
			him from the kitchengardens on the rising ground 
			above the river. He smiled to think that it was this disorder, 
			the misrule and confusion of his father's house and the stagnation 
			of vegetable life, which was to win the day in his soul. 
			Then a short laugh broke from his lips as he thought of that 
			solitary farmhand in the kitchengardens behind their house 
			whom they had nicknamed the man with the hat. A second 
			laugh, taking rise from the first after a pause, broke from him 
			involuntarily as he thought of how the man with the hat 
			worked, considering in turn the four points of the sky and then 
			regretfully plunging his spade in the earth. </p>
		<p>He pushed open the latchless door of the porch and passed 
			through the naked hallway into the kitchen. A group of his 
			brothers and sisters was sitting round the table. Tea was 
			nearly over and only the last of the second watered tea remained 
			in the bottoms of the small glassjars and jampots 
			which did service for teacups. Discarded crusts and lumps of 
			sugared bread, turned brown by the tea which had been 
			poured over them, lay scattered on the table. Little wells of 
			tea lay here and there on the board and a knife with a broken 
			ivory handle was stuck through the pith of a ravaged turnover. </p>
		<p>The sad quiet greyblue glow of the dying day came through 
			the window and the open door, covering over and allaying 
			quietly a sudden instinct of remorse in Stephen's heart. All 
			that had been denied them had been freely given to him, the 
			eldest: but the quiet glow of evening showed him in their faces 
			no sign of rancour. </p>
		<p>He sat near them at the table and asked where his father 
			and mother were. One answered: </p>
		<p>—Goneboro toboro lookboro atboro aboro houseboro. </p>
		<p>Still another removal! A boy named Fallon in Belvedere 
			had often asked him with a silly laugh why they moved so 
			often. A frown of scorn darkened quickly his forehead as he 
			heard again the silly laugh of the questioner. </p>
		<p>He asked: </p>
		<p>—Why are we on the move again, if it's a fair question? </p>
		<p>The same sister answered: </p>
		<p>—Becauseboro theboro landboro lordboro willboro putboro 
			usboro outboro. </p>
		<p>The voice of his youngest brother from the farther side of 
			the fireplace began to sing the air <hi rend="italic">Oft in the Stilly Night</hi>. One 
			by one the others took up the air until a full choir of voices 
			was singing. They would sing so for hours, melody after 
			melody, glee after glee, till the last pale light died down on the 
			horizon, till the first dark nightclouds came forth and night 
			fell. </p>
		<p>He waited for some moments, listening, before he too took 
			up the air with them. He was listening with pain of spirit to the 
			overtone of weariness behind their frail fresh innocent voices. 
			Even before they set out on life's journey they seemed weary 
			already of the way. </p>
		<p>He heard the choir of voices in the kitchen echoed and 
			multiplied through an endless reverberation of the choirs of 
			endless generations of children: and heard in all the echoes an 
			echo also of the recurring note of weariness and pain. All 
			seemed weary of life even before entering upon it. And he 
			remembered that Newman had heard this note also in the 
			broken lines of Virgil <hi rend="italic">giving utterance, like the voice of Nature 
				herself, to that pain and weariness yet hope of better things 
				which has been the experience of her children in every time.</hi></p>

		<p>He could wait no longer. </p>
		<p>From the door of Byron's publichouse to the gate of Clontarf 
			Chapel, from the gate of Clontarf Chapel to the door of 
			Byron's publichouse and then back again to the chapel and 
			then back again to the publichouse he had paced slowly at 
			first, planting his steps scrupulously in the spaces of the patchwork 
			of the footpath, then timing their fall to the fall of verses. 
			A full hour had passed since his father had gone in with Dan 
			Crosby, the tutor, to find out for him something about the 
			university. For a full hour he had paced up and down, 
			waiting: but he could wait no longer. </p>
		<p>He set off abruptly for the Bull, walking rapidly lest his 
			father's shrill whistle might call him back; and in a few moments 
			he had rounded the curve at the police barrack and was 
			safe. </p>
		<p>Yes, his mother was hostile to the idea, as he  had read from 
			her listless silence. Yet her mistrust pricked him more keenly 
			than his father's pride and he thought coldly how he had 
			watched the faith which was fading down in his soul aging and 
			strengthening in her eyes. A dim antagonism gathered force 
			within him and darkened his mind as a cloud against her 
			disloyalty:  and when it  passed, cloudlike, leaving his mind 
			serene and dutiful towards her again, he was made aware 
			dimly and without regret of a first noiseless sundering of their 
			lives. </p>
		<p>The university! So he had passed beyond the challenge of 
			the  sentries who had stood as guardians of his boyhood and 
			had sought to keep him among them that he might be subject 
			to them and serve their ends. Pride after satisfaction uplifted 
			him like long slow waves. The end he had been born to serve 
			yet did not see had led him to escape by an unseen path: and 
			now it beckoned to him once more and a new adventure was 
			about to be opened to him. It seemed to him that he heard 
			notes of fitful music leaping upwards a tone and downwards a 
			diminished fourth, upwards a tone and downwards a major 
			third, like triplebranching flames leaping fitfully, flame after 
			flame, out of a midnight wood. It was an elfin prelude, endless 
			and formless; and, as it grew wilder and faster, the flames 
			leaping out of time, he seemed to hear from under the boughs 
			and grasses wild creatures racing, their feet pattering like rain 
			upon the leaves. Their feet passed in pattering tumult over his 
			mind, the feet of hares and rabbits, the feet of harts and hinds 
			and antelopes, until he heard them no more and remembered 
			only a proud cadence from Newman: <hi rend="italic">Whose feet are as the 
			feet of harts and underneath the everlasting arms.</hi> </p>
		<p>The pride of that dim image brought back to his mind the 
			dignity of the office he had refused. All through his boyhood 
			he had mused upon that which he had so often thought to be 
			his destiny and when the moment had come for him to obey 
			the call he had turned aside, obeying a wayward instinct. Now 
			time lay between: the oils of ordination would never anoint 
			his body. He had refused. Why? </p>
		<p>He turned seaward  from the road at  Dollymount and as he 
			passed on to the thin wooden bridge he felt the planks shaking 
			with the tramp of heavily shod feet. A squad of christian 
			brothers was on its way back from the Bull and had begun to 
			pass, two by two, across the bridge. Soon the whole bridge 
			was trembling and resounding. The uncouth faces passed him 
			two by two, stained yellow or red or livid by the sea, and as 
			he strove to look at them with ease and indifference, a faint 
			stain of personal shame and commiseration rose to his own 
			face. Angry with himself he tried to hide his face from their 
			eyes by gazing down sideways into the shallow swirling water 
			under the bridge but he still saw a reflection therein of their 
			topheavy silk hats, and humble tapelike collars and loosely 
			hanging clerical clothes. </p>
		<p>—Brother Hickey. </p>
		<p>Brother Quaid. </p>
		<p>Brother MacArdle. </p>
		<p>Brother Keogh. </p>
		<p>Their piety would be like their names, like their faces, like 
			their clothes, and it was idle for him to tell himself that their 
			humble and contrite hearts, it might be, paid a far richer 
			tribute of devotion than his had ever been, a gift tenfold more 
			acceptable than his elaborate adoration. It was idle for him to 
			move himself to be generous towards them, to tell himself that 
			if he ever came to their gates, stripped of his pride, beaten and 
			in beggar's weeds, that they would be generous towards him, 
			loving him as themselves. Idle and embittering, finally,  to 
			argue, against his own dispassionate certitude, that the commandment 
			of love bade us not to love our neighbour  as ourselves 
			with the same amount and intensity of love but to love 
			him as ourselves with the same kind of love. </p>
		<p>He drew forth a phrase from his treasure and spoke it softly 
			to himself: </p>
		<p>—A day of dappled seaborne clouds. </p>
		<p>The phrase and the day and the scene harmonised in a 
			chord. Words. Was it their colours? He allowed them to glow 
			and fade, hue after hue: sunrise gold, the russet and green of 
			apple orchards, azure of waves, the greyfringed fleece of 
			clouds. No, it was not their colours: it was the poise and 
			balance of the period itself. Did he then love the rhythmic rise 
			and fall of words better than their associations of legend and 
			colour? Or was it that, being as weak of sight as he was shy of 
			mind, he drew less pleasure from the reflection of the glowing 
			sensible world through the prism of a language manycoloured 
			and richly storied than from the contemplation of an inner 
			world of individual emotions mirrored perfectly in a lucid 
			supple periodic prose? </p>
		<p>He passed from the trembling bridge on to firm land again. 
			At that instant, as it seemed to him, the air was chilled and 
			looking askance towards the water he saw a flying squall 
			darkening and crisping suddenly the tide. A faint click at his 
			heart, a faint throb in his throat told him once more of how his 
			flesh dreaded the cold infrahuman odour of the sea: yet he did 
			not strike across the downs on his left but held straight on 
			along the spine of rocks that pointed against the river's mouth. </p>
		<p>A veiled sunlight lit up faintly the grey sheet of water where 
			the river was embayed. In the distance along the course of the 
			slowflowing Liffey slender masts flecked the sky and, more 
			distant still, the dim fabric of the city lay prone in haze. Like a 
			scene on some vague arras, old as man's weariness, the image 
			of the seventh city of christendom was visible to him across the 
			timeless air, no older nor more weary nor less patient of subjection 
			than in the days of the thingmote. </p>
		<p>Disheartened, he raised his eyes towards the slowdrifting 
			clouds, dappled and seaborne. They were voyaging across the 
			deserts of the sky, a host of nomads on the march, voyaging 
			high over Ireland, westward bound. The Europe they had 
			come from lay out there beyond the Irish Sea, Europe of 
			strange tongues and valleyed and woodbegirt and citadelled 
			and of entrenched and marshalled races. He heard a confused 
			music within him as of memories and names which he was 
			almost conscious of but could not capture even for an instant; 
			then the music seemed to recede, to  recede, to recede: and 
			from each receding trail of nebulous music there fell always 
			one longdrawn calling note, piercing like a star the dusk of 
			silence. Again! Again! Again! A voice from beyond the world 
			was calling. </p>
		<p>—Hello, Stephanos! </p>
		<p>—Here comes The Dedalus! </p>
		<p>—Ao! ... Eh, give it over, Dwyer, I'm telling you or I'll 
			give you a stuff in the kisser for yourself .... Ao! </p>
		<p>—Good man, Towser! Duck him! </p>
		<p>—Come along, Dedalus! Bous Stephanoumenos! Bous 
			Stephaneforos! </p>
		<p>—Duck him! Guzzle him now, Towser! </p>
		<p>—Help! Help! ... Ao! </p>
		<p>He recognised their speech collectively before he distinguished 
			their faces. The mere sight of that medley of wet 
			nakedness chilled him to the bone. Their bodies, corpsewhite 
			or suffused with a pallid golden light or rawly tanned by the 
			suns, gleamed with the wet of the sea. Their divingstone, 
			poised on its rude supports and rocking under their plunges, 
			and the roughhewn stones of the sloping breakwater over 
			which they scrambled in their horseplay, gleamed with cold wet 
			lustre. The towels with which they smacked their bodies were 
			heavy with cold seawater: and drenched with cold brine was 
			their matted hair. </p>
		<p>He stood still in deference to their calls and parried their 
			banter with easy words. How characterless they looked: 
			Shuley without his deep unbuttoned collar, Ennis without his 
			scarlet belt with the snaky clasp, and Connolly  without his 
			Norfolk coat with the flapless sidepockets!  It was a pain to see 
			them and a swordlike pain to see the signs of adolescence that 
			made repellent their pitiable nakedness. Perhaps they had 
			taken refuge in number and noise from the secret dread in 
			their souls. But he, apart from them and in silence, remembered 
			in what dread he stood of the mystery of his own body. </p>
		<p>—Stephanos Dedalos! Bous Stephanoumenos! Bous Stephaneforos! </p>
		<p>Their banter was not new to him and now it flattered his 
			mild proud sovereignty. Now, as never before, his strange 
			name seemed to him a prophecy. So timeless seemed the grey 
			warm air, so fluid and impersonal his own mood, that all ages 
			were as one to him. A moment before the ghost of the ancient 
			kingdom of the Danes had looked forth through the vesture of 
			the hazewrapped city. Now, at the name of the fabulous 
			artificer, he seemed to hear the noise of dim waves and to see 
			a winged form flying above the waves and slowly climbing the 
			air. What did it mean? Was it a quaint device opening a page 
			of some medieval book of prophecies and symbols, a hawklike 
			man flying sunward above the sea, a prophecy of the end he 
			had been born to serve and had been following through the 
			mists of childhood and boyhood, a symbol of the artist forging 
			anew in his workshop out of the sluggish matter of the 
			earth a new soaring impalpable imperishable being? </p>
		<p>His heart trembled;  his breath came faster and a wild spirit 
			passed over his limbs as though he were soaring sunward. His 
			heart trembled in an ecstasy of fear and his soul was in flight. 
			His soul was soaring in an air beyond the world and the body 
			he knew was purified in a breath and delivered of incertitude 
			and made radiant and commingled with the element of the 
			spirit. An ecstasy of flight made radiant his eyes and wild his 
			breath  and tremulous and wild and radiant his windswept 
			limbs. </p>
		<p>—One! Two! ... Look out! </p>
		<p>—O, cripes, I'm drownded! </p>
		<p>—One! Two! Three and away! </p>
		<p>—Me next! Me next! </p>
		<p>—One! ... Uk! </p>
		<p>—Stephaneforos! </p>
		<p>His throat ached with a desire to cry aloud, the cry of a 
			hawk or eagle on high, to cry piercingly of his deliverance to 
			the winds. This was the call of life to his soul not the dull gross 
			voice of the world of duties and despair, not the inhuman 
			voice that had called him to the pale service of the altar. An 
			instant of wild flight had delivered him and the cry of triumph 
			which his lips withheld cleft his brain. </p>
		<p>—Stephaneforos! </p>
		<p>What were they now but cerements shaken from the 
			body of death - the fear he had walked in night and day, the 
			incertitude that had ringed him round, the shame that had 
			abased him within and without - cerements, the linens of the 
			grave? </p>
		<p>His soul had arisen from the grave of boyhood, spurning 
			her graveclothes.  Yes! Yes! Yes! He would create proudly out 
			of the freedom and power of his soul, as the great artificer 
			whose name he bore, a living thing, new and soaring and 
			beautiful, impalpable, imperishable. </p>
		<p>He started up nervously from the stoneblock for he could 
			no longer quench the flame in his blood. He felt his cheeks 
			aflame and his throat throbbing with song. There was a lust of 
			wandering in his feet that burned to set out for the ends of the 
			earth. On! On! his heart seemed to cry. Evening would deepen 
			above the sea, night fall upon the plains, dawn glimmer before 
			the wanderer and show him strange fields and hills and faces. 
			Where? </p>
		<p>He looked northward towards Howth. The sea had fallen 
			below the line of seawrack on the shallow side of the breakwater 
			and already the tide was running out fast along the 
			foreshore. Already one long oval bank of sand lay warm and 
			dry amid the wavelets. Here and there warm isles of sand 
			gleamed above the shallow tide, and about the isles and 
			around the long bank and amid the shallow currents of the 
			beach were lightclad gayclad figures, wading and delving. </p>
		<p>In a few moments he was barefoot, his stockings folded in 
			his pockets and his canvas shoes dangling by their knotted 
			laces over his shoulders: and, picking a pointed salteaten stick 
			out of the jetsam among the rocks, he clambered down the 
			slope of the breakwater. </p>
		<p>There was a long rivulet in the strand: and, as he waded 
			slowly up its course, he wondered at the endless drift of seaweed. 
			Emerald and black and russet and olive, it moved beneath 
			the current, swaying and turning. The water of the 
			rivulet was dark with endless drift and mirrored the highdrifting 
			clouds. The clouds were drifting above him silently 
			and silently the seatangle was drifting below him; and the grey 
			warm air was still: and a new wild life was singing in his veins. </p>
		<p>Where was his boyhood now? Where was the soul that had 
			hung back from her destiny, to brood alone upon the shame of 
			her wounds and in her house of squalor and subterfuge to 
			queen it in faded cerements and in wreaths that withered at 
			the touch? Or where was he? </p>
		<p>He was alone. He was unheeded, happy and near to the 
			wild heart of life. He was alone and young and wilful and 
			wildhearted, alone amid a waste of wild air and brackish 
			waters and the seaharvest of shells and tangle and veiled grey 
			sunlight and gayclad lightclad figures, of children and girls and 
			voices childish and girlish in the air. </p>
		<p>A girl stood before him in midstream, alone and still, gazing 
			out to sea. She seemed like one whom magic had changed into 
			the likeness of a strange and beautiful seabird. Her long slender 
			bare legs were delicate as a crane's and pure save where an 
			emerald trail of seaweed had fashioned itself as a sign upon 
			the flesh. Her thighs, fuller and softhued as ivory, were bared 
			almost to the hips where the white fringes of her drawers were 
			like featherings of soft white down. Her slateblue skirts were 
			kilted boldly about her waist and dovetailed behind her. Her 
			bosom was as  a bird's soft and slight, slight and soft as the 
			breast of some darkplumaged dove. But her long fair hair was 
			girlish: and girlish, and touched with the wonder of mortal 
			beauty, her face. </p>
		<p>She was alone and still, gazing out to sea; and when she felt 
			his presence and the worship of his eyes her eyes turned to 
			him in quiet sufferance of his gaze, without shame or wantonness. 
			Long, long she suffered his gaze and then quietly withdrew 
			her eyes from his and bent them towards the stream, 
			gently stirring the water with her foot hither and thither. The 
			first faint noise of gently moving water broke the silence, low 
			and faint and whispering, faint as the bells of sleep; hither and 
			thither, hither and thither: and a faint flame trembled on her 
			cheek. </p>
		<p>—Heavenly God! cried Stephen's soul, in an outburst of 
			profane joy. </p>
		<p>He turned away from her suddenly and set off across the 
			strand. His cheeks  were aflame; his body was aglow; his limbs 
			were trembling. On and on and on and on he strode, far out 
			over the sands, singing wildly to the sea, crying to greet the 
			advent of the life that had cried to him. </p>
		<p>Her image had passed into his soul for ever and no word 
			had broken the holy silence of his ecstasy. Her eyes had called 
			him and his soul had leaped at the call. To live, to err, to fall, 
			to triumph, to recreate life out of life! A wild angel had appeared 
			to him, the angel of mortal youth and beauty, an envoy 
			from the fair courts of life, to throw open before him in an 
			instant of ecstasy the gates of all the ways of error and glory. 
			On and on and on and on! </p>
		<p>He halted suddenly and heard his heart in the silence. How 
			far had he walked? What hour was it? </p>
		<p>There was no human figure near him nor any sound borne 
			to him over the air. But the tide was near the turn and already 
			the day was on the wane. He turned landward and ran towards 
			the shore and, running up the sloping beach, reckless of the 
			sharp shingle, found a sandy nook amid a ring of tufted sandknolls 
			and lay down there that the peace and silence of the 
			evening might still the riot of his blood. </p>
		<p>He  felt above him the vast indifferent dome and the calm 
			processes of the heavenly bodies; and the earth beneath him, 
			the earth that had borne him, had taken him to her breast. </p>
		<p>He closed his eyes in the languor of sleep. His eyelids 
			trembled as if they felt the vast cyclic movement of the earth 
			and her watchers, trembled as if they felt the strange light of 
			some new world. His soul was swooning into some new world, 
			fantastic, dim, uncertain as under sea, traversed by cloudy 
			shapes and beings. A world, a glimmer, or a flower? Glimmering 
			and trembling, trembling and unfolding, a breaking light, 
			an opening flower, it spread in endless succession to itself, 
			breaking in full crimson and unfolding and fading to palest 
			rose, leaf by leaf and wave of light by wave of light, flooding 
			all the heavens with its soft flushes, every flush deeper than 
			other. </p>
		<p>Evening had fallen when he woke and the sand and arid 
			grasses of his bed glowed no longer. He rose slowly and, 
			recalling the rapture of his sleep, sighed at its joy. </p>
		<p>He climbed to the crest of the sandhill and gazed about 
			him. Evening had fallen. A rim of the young moon cleft the 
			pale waste of sky like the rim of a silver hoop embedded in 
			grey sand; and the tide was flowing in fast to the land with a 
			low whisper of her waves, islanding a few last figures in distant 
			pools. </p>

		<p>He drained his third cup of watery tea to the dregs and 
			set to chewing the crusts of fried bread that were scattered 
			near him, staring into the dark pool of the jar. The 
			yellow dripping had been scooped out like a boghole and the 
			pool under it brought back to his memory the dark turfcoloured 
			water of the bath in Clongowes. The box of pawn-tickets 
			at his elbow had just been rifled and he took up idly 
			one after another in his greasy fingers the blue and white 
			dockets, scrawled and sanded and creased and bearing the 
			name of the pledger as Daly or MacEvoy. </p>

		<p>1 Pair Buskins. </p>
		<p>1 D. Coat. </p>
		<p>3 Articles and White. </p>
		<p>1 Man's Pants. </p>

		<p>Then he put them aside and gazed thoughtfully at the lid of 
			the box, speckled with lousemarks, and asked vaguely: </p>
		<p>—How much is the clock fast now? </p>
		<p>His mother straightened the battered alarmclock that was 
			lying on its side in the middle of the kitchen mantelpiece until 
			its dial showed a quarter to twelve and then laid it once more 
			on its side. </p>
		<p>—An hour and twentyfive minutes, she said. The right time 
			now is  twenty past ten. The dear knows you might try to be in 
			time for your lectures. </p>
		<p>—Fill out the place for me to wash, said Stephen. </p>
		<p>—Katey, fill out the place for Stephen to wash. </p>
		<p>—Boody, fill out the place for Stephen to wash. </p>
		<p>—I can't, I'm going for blue. Fill it out, you, Maggie. </p>
		<p>When the enamelled basin had  been fitted into the well of 
			the sink and the old washingglove flung on the side of it he 
			allowed his mother to scrub his neck and root into the folds of 
			his ears and into the interstices at the wings of his nose. </p>
		<p>—Well, it's a poor case, she said, when a university student 
			is so dirty that his mother has to wash him. </p>
		<p>—But it gives you pleasure, said Stephen calmly. </p>
		<p>An earsplitting whistle was heard from upstairs and his 
			mother thrust  a damp overall into his hands, saying: </p>
		<p>—Dry yourself and hurry out for the love of goodness. </p>
		<p>A second shrill whistle, prolonged angrily, brought one of 
			the girls to the foot of the staircase. </p>
		<p>—Yes, father? </p>
		<p>—Is your lazy bitch of a brother gone out yet? </p>
		<p>—Yes, father. </p>
		<p>—Sure? </p>
		<p>—Yes, father. </p>
		<p>—Hm! </p>
		<p>The girl came back making signs  to him to be quick and go 
			out quietly by the back. Stephen laughed and said: </p>
		<p>—He has  a curious idea of genders if he thinks a bitch is 
			masculine. </p>
		<p>—Ah, it's a scandalous shame for you, Stephen, said his 
			mother, and you'll live to rue the day you set your foot in that 
			place. I know how it has changed you. </p>
		<p>—Good morning, everybody, said Stephen, smiling and 
			kissing the tips of his fingers in adieu. </p>
		<p>The lane  behind the terrace was waterlogged and as he 
			went down it slowly, choosing his steps amid heaps of wet 
			rubbish, he heard a mad nun screeching in the nuns' madhouse 
			beyond the wall. </p>
		<p>—Jesus! O Jesus! Jesus! </p>
		<p>He shook the sound out of his ears by an angry toss of his 
			head and hurried on, stumbling through the mouldering offal, 
			his heart already bitten by an ache of loathing and bitterness. 
			His father's whistle, his mother's mutterings, the screech of an 
			unseen maniac were to him now so many voices offending and 
			threatening to humble the pride of his youth. He drove their 
			echoes even out of his heart with an execration: but, as he 
			walked down the avenue and felt the grey morning light falling 
			about him through the dripping trees and smelt the strange 
			wild smell of the wet leaves and bark, his soul was loosed of 
			her miseries. </p>
		<p>The rainladen trees of the avenue evoked in him, as always, 
			memories of the girls and women in the plays of Gerhart 
			Hauptmann; and the memory of their pale sorrows and the 
			fragrance falling from the wet branches mingled in a mood of 
			quiet joy. His morning walk across the city had begun, and he 
			foreknew that as he passed the sloblands of Fairview he would 
			think of the cloistral silverveined prose of Newman, that as he 
			walked along the North Strand Road, glancing idly at the 
			windows of the provision shops, he would recall the dark 
			humour of Guido Cavalcanti and smile, that as he went by 
			Baird's stonecutting works in Talbot Place the spirit of Ibsen 
			would blow through him like a keen wind, a spirit of wayward 
			boyish beauty, and that passing a grimy marinedealer's shop 
			beyond the Liffey he would repeat the song by Ben Jonson 
			which begins: </p>
		<l><i>I was not wearier where I lay.</i> </l>
		<p>His mind, when wearied of its search for the essence of 
			beauty amid the spectral words of Aristotle or Aquinas, 
			turned often for its pleasure to the dainty songs of the Elizabethans. 
			His mind, in the vesture of a doubting monk, stood 
			often in shadow under the windows of that age, to hear the 
			grave and mocking music of the lutenists or the frank laughter 
			of waistcoateers until a laugh too low, a phrase, tarnished by 
			time, of chambering and false honour, stung his monkish pride 
			and drove him on from his lurkingplace. </p>
		<p>The lore which he was believed to pass his days brooding 
			upon so that it had rapt him from the companionships of 
			youth was only a garner of slender sentences from Aristotle's 
			poetics and psychology and a <seg xml:lang="lat"><hi rend="italic">Synopsis Philosophiae Scholasticae ad mentem divi Thomae</hi></seg>. His thinking was a dusk 
			of doubt and selfmistrust lit up at moments by the lightnings of 
			intuition, but lightnings of so clear a splendour that in those 
			moments the world perished about his feet as if it had been 
			fireconsumed: and thereafter his tongue grew heavy and he 
			met the eyes of others with unanswering eyes for he felt that 
			the spirit of beauty had folded him round like a mantle and 
			that in revery at least he had been acquainted with nobility. 
			But, when this brief pride of silence upheld him no longer, he 
			was glad to find himself still in the midst of common lives, 
			passing on his way amid the squalor and noise and sloth of the 
			city fearlessly and with a light heart. </p>
		<p>Near the hoardings on the canal he met the consumptive 
			man with the doll's face and the brimless hat coming towards 
			him down the slope of the bridge with little steps, tightly 
			buttoned into his chocolate overcoat,  and holding his furled 
			umbrella a span or two from him like a diviningrod. It must 
			be eleven, he thought, and peered into a dairy to see the time. 
			The clock in the dairy told him that it was five minutes to five 
			but, as he turned away, he heard a clock somewhere near him, 
			but unseen, beating eleven strokes in swift precision. He 
			laughed as he heard it for it made him think of MacCann and 
			he saw him a squat figure in a shooting jacket and breeches 
			and with a fair goatee, standing in the wind at Hopkins' corner, 
			and heard him say: </p>
		<p>—Dedalus, you're an antisocial being, wrapped up in 
			yourself. I'm not. I'm a democrat: and I'll work and act for 
			social liberty and equality among all classes and sexes in the 
			United States of the Europe of the future. </p>
		<p>Eleven! Then he was late for that lecture too. What day of 
			the week was it? He stopped at a newsagent's to read the 
			headline of a placard. Thursday.  Ten to eleven, English; 
			eleven to twelve, French;  twelve to one, physics. He fancied to 
			himself the English lecture and felt, even at that distance, 
			restless and helpless. He saw the heads of his classmates 
			meekly bent as they wrote in their notebooks the points they 
			were bidden to note, nominal definitions, essential definitions 
			and examples or dates of birth or death, chief works, a favourable 
			and an unfavourable criticism side by side. His own 
			head was unbent for his thoughts wandered abroad and 
			whether he looked around the little class of students or out of 
			the window across the desolate gardens of the green an odour 
			assailed him of cheerless cellardamp and decay. Another head 
			than his, right before him in the first benches, was poised 
			squarely above its bending fellows like the head of a priest 
			appealing without humility to the tabernacle for the humble 
			worshippers about him. Why was it that when he thought of 
			Cranly he could never raise before his mind the entire image 
			of his body but only the image of the head and face? Even 
			now against the grey curtain of the morning he saw it before 
			him like the phantom of a dream, the face of a severed head or 
			deathmask, crowned on the brows by its stiff black upright 
			hair as by an iron crown. It was a priestlike face, priestlike in 
			its pallor, in the widewinged nose, in the shadowings below the 
			eyes and along the jaws, priestlike in the lips that were long 
			and bloodless and faintly smiling: and Stephen, remembering 
			swiftly how he had told Cranly of all the tumults and unrest 
			and longings in his soul, day after day and night by night, only 
			to be answered by his friend's listening silence, would have 
			told himself that it was the face of a guilty priest who heard 
			confessions of those whom  he had not  power to absolve but 
			that he felt again in memory the gaze of its dark womanish 
			eyes. </p>
		<p>Through this image he had a glimpse of a strange dark 
			cavern of speculation but at once turned away from it, feeling 
			that it was not yet the hour  to enter it. But the nightshade of 
			his friend's listlessness seemed to be diffusing in the air around 
			him a tenuous and deadly exhalation and he found himself 
			glancing from one casual word to another on his right or left 
			in stolid wonder that they had been so silently emptied of 
			instantaneous sense until every mean shop legend bound his 
			mind like the words of a spell and his soul shrivelled up, sighing 
			with age as he walked on in a lane among heaps of dead 
			language. His own consciousness of language was ebbing from 
			his brain and trickling into the very words themselves which 
			set to band and disband themselves in wayward rhythms: </p>
		<lg>
			<l>The ivy whines upon the wall </l>
			<l>And whines and twines upon the wall </l>
			<l>The ivy whines upon the wall </l>
			<l>The yellow ivy on the wall </l>
			<l>Ivy, ivy up the wall. </l>
		</lg>
		<p>Did any one ever hear such drivel? Lord Almighty! Who 
			ever heard of ivy whining on a wall? Yellow ivy: that was all 
			right. Yellow ivory also. And what about ivory ivy? </p>
		<p>The word now shone in his brain, clearer and brighter than 
			any ivory sawn from the mottled tusks of elephants. <hi rend="italic">Ivory, 
				<seg xml:lang="fra">ivoire</seg>, <seg xml:lang="ita">avorio</seg>, <seg xml:lang="lat">ebur</seg>.</hi> One of the first examples that he had 
			learnt in Latin had run: <seg xml:lang="lat"><hi rend="italic">India mittit ebur</hi></seg>; and he recalled the 
			shrewd northern face of the rector who had taught him to 
			construe the Metamorphoses of Ovid in a courtly English, 
			made whimsical by the mention of porkers and potsherds and 
			chines of bacon. He had learnt what little he knew of the laws 
			of Latin verse from a ragged book written by a Portuguese 
			priest. </p>
		<l><i>Contrahit orator, variant in carmine vates.</i> </l>
		<p>The crises and victories and secessions in Roman history were 
			handed on to him in the trite words <seg xml:lang="lat"><hi rend="italic">in tanto discrimine</hi></seg> and he 
			had tried to peer into the social life of the city of cities through 
			the words <seg xml:lang="lat"><hi rend="italic">implere ollam denariorum</hi></seg> which the rector had 
			rendered sonorously as the filling of a pot with denaries.  The 
			pages of his timeworn Horace never felt cold to the touch even 
			when his own fingers were cold:  they were human pages: and 
			fifty years before they had been turned by the human fingers 
			of John Duncan Inverarity and by his brother, William Malcolm 
			Inverarity. Yes, those were noble names on the dusky 
			flyleaf and, even for so poor a Latinist as he, the dusky verses 
			were as fragrant as though they had lain all those years in 
			myrtle and lavender and vervain; but yet it wounded him to 
			think that he would never be but a shy guest at the feast of the 
			world's culture and that the monkish learning, in terms of 
			which he was striving to forge out an esthetic philosophy, was 
			held no higher by the age he lived in than the subtle and 
			curious jargons of heraldry and falconry. </p>
		<p>The grey block of Trinity on his left, set heavily in the city's 
			ignorance like a great dull stone set in a cumbrous ring, pulled 
			his mind downward; and while he was striving this way and 
			that to free his feet from the fetters of the reformed conscience 
			he came upon the droll statue of the national poet of Ireland. </p>
		<p>He looked at it without anger: for, though sloth of the body 
			and of  the soul crept over it like unseen vermin, over the 
			shuffling feet and up the folds of the cloak and around the 
			servile head, it seemed humbly conscious of its indignity. It 
			was a Firbolg in the borrowed cloak of a Milesian; and he 
			thought of his friend Davin, the peasant student. It was a 
			jesting name between them but the young peasant bore with it 
			lightly saying: </p>
		<p>—Go on, Stevie,  I have a hard head, you tell me. Call me 
			what you will. </p>
		<p>The homely version of his christian name on the lips of his 
			friend had touched Stephen pleasantly when first heard for he 
			was as formal in speech with others as they were with him. 
			Often, as he sat in Davin's rooms in Grantham Street, wondering 
			at his friend's wellmade boots that flanked the wall pair by 
			pair and repeating for his friend's simple ear the verses and 
			cadences of others which were the veils of his own longing and 
			dejection, the rude Firbolg mind of his listener had drawn his 
			mind towards it and flung it back again, drawing it by a quiet 
			inbred courtesy of attention or by a quaint turn of old English 
			speech or by the force of its delight in rude bodily skill - for 
			Davin had sat at the feet of Michael Cusack, the Gael - 
			repelling swiftly and suddenly by a grossness of intelligence or 
			by a bluntness of feeling or by a dull stare of terror in the eyes, 
			the terror of soul of a starving Irish village in which the curfew 
			was still a nightly fear. </p>
		<p>Side by side with his memory of the deeds of prowess of his 
			uncle Mat Davin, the athlete, the young peasant worshipped 
			the sorrowful legend of Ireland. The gossip of his fellowstudents 
			which strove to render the flat life of the college 
			significant at any cost loved to think of him as a young fenian. 
			His nurse had taught him Irish and shaped his rude imagination 
			by the broken lights of Irish myth. He stood towards this 
			myth upon which no individual mind had ever drawn out a 
			line of beauty and to its unwieldy  tales that divided themselves 
			as they moved down the cycles in the same attitude as towards 
			the Roman catholic religion, the attitude of a dullwitted loyal 
			serf. Whatsoever of thought or of feeling came to him from 
			England or by way of English culture his mind stood armed 
			against in obedience to a password: and of the world that lay 
			beyond England he knew only the foreign legion of France in 
			which he spoke of serving. </p>
		<p>Coupling  this ambition with the young man's humour 
			Stephen had often called him one of the tame geese: and there 
			was even a point of irritation in the name pointed against that 
			very reluctance of speech and deed in his friend which seemed 
			so often to stand between Stephen's mind, eager of speculation, 
			and the hidden ways of Irish life. </p>
		<p>One night the young peasant, his spirit stung by the violent 
			or luxurious language in which Stephen escaped from the cold 
			silence of intellectual revolt, had called up before Stephen's 
			mind a strange vision. The two were walking slowly towards 
			Davin's room through the dark narrow streets of the poorer 
			jews. </p>
		<p>—A thing happened to myself, Stevie, last autumn, coming 
			on winter, and I never told it to a living soul and you are the 
			first person now I ever told it to. I disremember if it was 
			October or November. It was October because it was before  I 
			came up here to join the matriculation class. </p>
		<p>Stephen had turned his smiling eyes towards his friend's 
			face, flattered by his confidence and won over to sympathy by 
			the speaker's simple accent. </p>
		<p>—I was away all that day from my own place over in Buttevant 
			- I don't know if you know where that is - at a hurling 
			match between the Croke's Own Boys and the Fearless 
			Thurles and by God, Stevie, that was the hard fight. My first 
			cousin, Fonsy Davin, was stripped to his buff that day minding 
			cool for the Limericks but he was up with the forwards half 
			the time and shouting like mad. I never will forget that day. 
			One of the Crokes made a woeful wipe at him one time with 
			his camaun and I declare to God he was within an aim's ace of 
			getting it at the side of the temple. Oh, honest to God, if the 
			crook of it caught him that time he was done for. </p>
		<p>—I am glad he escaped, Stephen had  said with a laugh, but 
			surely that's not the strange thing  that happened you? </p>
		<p>—Well, I suppose that doesn't interest you but leastways 
			there was such noise after the match that I missed the train 
			home and I couldn't get any kind of a yoke to give me a lift for, 
			as luck would have it, there was a mass meeting that same day 
			over in Castletownroche and all the cars in the country were 
			there. So there was nothing for it only to stay the night or to 
			foot it out. Well, I started to walk and on I went and it was 
			coming on night when I got into the Ballyhoura hills; that's 
			better than ten miles from Kilmallock and there's a long lonely 
			road after that.  You wouldn't see the sign of a christian house 
			along the road or hear a sound. It was pitch dark almost. Once 
			or twice I stopped by the way under a bush to redden my pipe 
			and only for the dew was thick I'd have stretched out there 
			and slept. At last, after a bend of the road, I spied a little 
			cottage with a light in the window. I went up and knocked at 
			the door. A voice asked who was there and I answered I was 
			over at the match in Buttevant and was walking back and that 
			I'd be thankful for a glass of water. After a while a young 
			woman opened the door and brought me out a big mug of 
			milk. She was half undressed as if she was going to bed when I 
			knocked and she had her hair hanging; and I thought by her 
			figure and by something in the look of her eyes that she must 
			be carrying a child. She kept me in talk a long while at the 
			door and I thought it strange because her breast and her 
			shoulders were bare. She asked me was I tired and would I 
			like to stop the night there. She said she was all alone in the 
			house and that her husband had gone that morning to Queenstown 
			with his sister to see her off. And all the time she was 
			talking, Stevie,  she had her eyes fixed on my face and she 
			stood so close to me I could hear her breathing. When I 
			handed her back the mug at last she took my hand to draw me 
			in over the threshold and said: <hi rend="italic">Come in and stay the night
			here. You've no call to be frightened. There's no one in it but
			ourselves</hi> .... I didn't go in, Stevie.  I thanked her and went 
			on my way again, all in a fever. At the first bend of the road I 
			looked back and she was standing at the door. </p>
		<p>The last words of Davin's story sang in his memory  and the 
			figure of the woman in the story stood forth, reflected in other 
			figures of the peasant women whom he had seen standing in 
			the doorways at Clane as the college cars drove by, as a type 
			of her race and his own, a batlike soul waking to the consciousness 
			of itself in darkness and secrecy and loneliness and, 
			through the eyes and voice and gesture of a woman without 
			guile, calling the stranger to her bed. </p>
		<p>A hand was laid on his arm and a young voice cried: </p>
		<p>—Ah, gentleman, your own girl, sir! The first handsel 
			today, gentleman. Buy  that lovely bunch. Will you, gentleman? </p>
		<p>The blue flowers which she lifted towards him and her 
			young blue eyes seemed to him at that instant images of guilelessness; 
			and he halted till the image had vanished and he saw 
			only her ragged dress and damp coarse hair and  hoydenish 
			face. </p>
		<p>—Do, gentleman! Don't forget your own girl, sir! </p>
		<p>—I have no money, said Stephen. </p>
		<p>—Buy them lovely ones, will you, sir? Only a penny. </p>
		<p>—Did you hear what I said? asked Stephen, bending towards 
			her. I told you I had no money. I tell you again now. </p>
		<p>—Well, sure, you will some day, sir, please God, the girl 
			answered after an instant. </p>
		<p>—Possibly, said Stephen, but I don't think it likely. </p>
		<p>He left her quickly, fearing that her intimacy might turn to 
			gibing and wishing to be out of the way before she offered her 
			ware to another, a tourist from England or a student of Trinity. 
			Grafton Street, along which he walked, prolonged that 
			moment of discouraged poverty. In the roadway at the head of 
			the street a slab was set to the memory of Wolfe Tone and he 
			remembered having been present with his father at its laying. 
			He remembered with bitterness that scene of tawdry tribute. 
			There were four French delegates in a brake and one, a plump 
			smiling young man, held, wedged on a stick,  a card on which 
			were printed the words: <seg xml:lang="fra"><hi rend="italic">Vive l'Irlande!</hi></seg></p>
		<p>But the trees in Stephen's Green were fragrant of rain and 
			the rainsodden earth gave forth its mortal odour, a faint 
			incense rising upward through the mould from many hearts. 
			The soul of the gallant venal city which his elders had told him 
			of had shrunk with time to a faint mortal odour rising from the 
			earth and he knew that in a moment when he entered the 
			sombre college he would be conscious of a corruption other 
			than that of Buck Egan and Burnchapel Whaley. </p>
		<p>It was too late to go upstairs to the French class. He 
			crossed the hall and took the corridor to the left which led to 
			the physics theatre. The corridor was dark and silent but not 
			unwatchful. Why did he feel that it was not unwatchful? Was 
			it because he had heard that in Buck Whaley's time there was 
			a secret staircase there? Or was the jesuit house extraterritorial 
			and was he walking among aliens? The Ireland of Tone 
			and of Parnell seemed to have receded in space. </p>
		<p>He opened the door of the theatre and halted in the chilly 
			grey light that struggled through the dusty windows. A figure 
			was crouching before the large grate and by its leanness and 
			greyness he knew that it was the dean of studies lighting the 
			fire. Stephen closed the door quietly and approached the 
			fireplace. </p>
		<p>—Good morning, sir! Can I help you? </p>
		<p>The priest looked up quickly and said: </p>
		<p>—One moment now, Mr Dedalus, and you will see. There 
			is an art in lighting a fire. We have the liberal arts and we have 
			the useful arts. This is one of the useful arts. </p>
		<p>—I will try to learn it, said Stephen. </p>
		<p>—Not too much coal, said the dean, working briskly at his 
			task, that is one of the secrets. </p>
		<p>He produced four candlebutts from the sidepockets of his 
			soutane and placed them deftly among the coals and twisted 
			papers. Stephen watched him in silence. Kneeling thus on the 
			flagstone to kindle the fire and busied with the disposition of 
			his wisps of paper and candlebutts he seemed more than ever 
			a humble server making ready the place of sacrifice in an 
			empty temple, a levite of the Lord. Like a levite's robe of 
			plain linen the faded worn soutane draped the kneeling figure 
			of one whom the canonicals or the  bellbordered ephod would 
			irk and trouble. His very body had waxed old in lowly service 
			of the Lord - in tending the fire upon the altar, in bearing 
			tidings secretly, in waiting upon worldlings, in striking swiftly 
			when bidden - and yet had remained ungraced by aught of 
			saintly or of prelatic beauty. Nay, his very soul had waxed old 
			in that service without growing towards light and beauty or 
			spreading abroad a sweet odour of her sanctity - a mortified 
			will no more responsive to the thrill of its obedience than was 
			to the thrill of love or combat his aging body, spare and sinewy, 
			greyed with a silverpointed down. </p>
		<p>The dean rested back on his hunkers and watched the sticks 
			catch. Stephen, to fill the silence, said: </p>
		<p>—I am sure I could not light a fire. </p>
		<p>—You are an artist, are you not, Mr Dedalus? said the 
			dean, glancing up and blinking his pale eyes. The object of the 
			artist is the creation of the beautiful. What the beautiful is is 
			another question. </p>
		<p>He rubbed his hands slowly and drily over the difficulty. </p>
		<p>—Can you solve that question now? he asked. </p>
		<p>—Aquinas, answered Stephen, says <seg xml:lang="lat"><hi rend="italic">Pulcra
			sunt quae visa placent</hi></seg>.</p>
		<p>—This fire before us, said the dean, will be pleasing to the 
			eye. Will it therefore be beautiful? </p>
		<p>—In so far as it is apprehended by the sight, which I suppose 
			means here esthetic intellection, it will be beautiful. But 
			Aquinas also says <seg xml:lang="lat"><hi rend="italic">Bonum est in quod tendit appetitus</hi></seg>. In so 
			far as it satisfies the animal craving for warmth fire is a good. 
			In hell however it is an evil. </p>
		<p>—Quite so, said the dean, you have certainly hit the nail on 
			the head. </p>
		<p>He rose nimbly and went towards the door, set it ajar and 
			said: </p>
		<p>—A draught is said to be a help in these matters. </p>
		<p>As he came back to the hearth, limping slightly but with a 
			brisk step, Stephen saw the silent soul of a jesuit look out at 
			him from the pale loveless eyes. Like Ignatius he was lame but 
			in his eyes burned no spark of Ignatius' enthusiasm. Even the 
			legendary craft of the company, a craft subtler and more 
			secret than its fabled books of secret subtle wisdom, had not 
			fired his soul with the energy of apostleship. It seemed as if 
			he used the shifts and lore and cunning of the world, as bidden 
			to do, for the greater glory of God, without joy in their 
			handling or hatred of that in them which was evil but turning 
			them, with a firm gesture of obedience, back upon themselves: 
			and for all this silent service it seemed as if he loved not at all 
			the master and little, if at all, the ends he served. <seg xml:lang="lat"><hi rend="italic">Similiter 
			atque senis baculus</hi></seg>, he was, as the founder would have had 
			him, like a staff in an old man's hand, to be left in a corner, to 
			be leaned on in the road at nightfall or in stress of weather,  to 
			lie with a lady's nosegay on a garden seat, to be raised in 
			menace. </p>
		<p>The dean returned to the hearth and began to stroke his 
			chin. </p>
		<p>—When may we expect to have something from you on the 
			esthetic question? he asked. </p>
		<p>—From me! said Stephen in astonishment. I stumble on  an 
			idea once a fortnight if I am lucky. </p>
		<p>—These questions are very profound, Mr Dedalus, said the 
			dean. It is like looking down from the cliffs of Moher into the 
			depths. Many go down into the depths and never come up. 
			Only the trained diver can go down into those depths and 
			explore them and come to the surface again. </p>
		<p>—If you mean speculation, sir, said Stephen, I also am sure 
			that there is no such thing  as free thinking inasmuch as all 
			thinking must be bound by its own laws. </p>
		<p>—Ha! </p>
		<p>—For my purpose I can work on at present by the light of 
			one or two ideas of Aristotle and Aquinas. </p>
		<p>—I see. I quite see your point. </p>
		<p>—I need them only for my own use and guidance until I 
			have done something for myself by their light. If the lamp 
			smokes or smells I shall try to trim it. If it does not give light 
			enough I shall sell it and buy another. </p>
		<p>—Epictetus also had a lamp, said the dean, which was sold 
			for a fancy price after his death. It was the lamp he wrote his 
			philosophical dissertations by. You know Epictetus? </p>
		<p>—An old gentleman, said Stephen coarsely, who said that 
			the soul is very like a bucketful of water. </p>
		<p>—He tells us in his homely way, the dean went on, that 
			he put an iron lamp before a statue of one of the gods and that 
			a thief stole the lamp. What did the philosopher do? He reflected 
			that it was in the character of a thief to steal and 
			determined to buy an earthen lamp next day instead of the 
			iron lamp. </p>
		<p>A smell  of molten  tallow came up from the dean's candle-butts 
			and fused itself in Stephen's consciousness with the 
			jingle of the words, bucket and lamp and lamp and bucket. The 
			priest's voice too had a hard jingling tone. Stephen's mind 
			halted by instinct, checked by the strange tone and the  imagery 
			and by the priest's face which seemed like an unlit lamp 
			or a reflector  hung in a false focus. What lay behind it or 
			within it? A dull torpor of the soul or the dullness of the 
			thundercloud, charged with intellection and capable of the 
			gloom of God? </p>
		<p>—I meant a different kind of lamp, sir, said Stephen. </p>
		<p>—Undoubtedly, said the dean. </p>
		<p>—One difficulty, said Stephen, in esthetic discussion is to 
			know whether words are being used according to the literary 
			tradition or according to the tradition of the marketplace. I 
			remember a sentence of Newman's in which he says of the 
			Blessed Virgin that she was detained in the full company of the 
			saints. The use of the word in the marketplace is quite 
			different. <hi rend="italic">I hope I am not detaining you.</hi> </p>
		<p>—Not in the least, said the dean politely. </p>
		<p>—No, no, said Stephen, smiling, I mean ... </p>
		<p>—Yes, yes: I see, said the dean quickly, I quite catch the 
			point: <hi rend="italic">detain</hi>. </p>
		<p>He thrust forward his under jaw and uttered a dry short 
			cough. </p>
		<p>—To return to the lamp, he said, the feeding of it is also a 
			nice problem. You must choose the pure oil and you must be 
			careful when you pour it in not to overflow it, not to pour in 
			more than the funnel can hold. </p>
		<p>—What funnel? asked Stephen. </p>
		<p>—The funnel through which you pour the  oil into your 
			lamp. </p>
		<p>—That? said Stephen. Is that called a funnel? Is it not a 
			tundish? </p>
		<p>—What is a tundish? </p>
		<p>—That. The ... the funnel. </p>
		<p>—Is that called a tundish in Ireland? asked the dean. I 
			never heard the word in my life. </p>
		<p>—It is called a tundish in Lower Drumcondra, said Stephen 
			laughing, where they speak the best English. </p>
		<p>—A tundish, said the dean reflectively. That is a most 
			interesting word. I must look that word up. Upon my word I 
			must. </p>
		<p>His courtesy of manner rang a little false, and Stephen 
			looked at the English convert with the same eyes as the elder 
			brother in the parable may have turned on the prodigal. A 
			humble follower in the wake of clamorous conversions,  a 
			poor Englishman in Ireland, he seemed to have entered on the 
			stage of jesuit history when that strange play of intrigue and 
			suffering and envy and struggle and indignity had been all but 
			given through - a late comer, a tardy spirit.  From what had he 
			set out? Perhaps he had been born and bred among serious 
			dissenters, seeing salvation in Jesus only and abhorring the 
			vain pomps of the establishment. Had he felt the need of an 
			implicit faith amid the welter of sectarianism and the jargon of 
			its turbulent schisms, six principle men, peculiar people, seed 
			and snake baptists, supralapsarian dogmatists? Had he found 
			the true church all of a sudden in winding up to the end like 
			a reel of cotton some finespun line of reasoning upon insufflation 
			or the imposition of hands or the procession of the 
			Holy Ghost? Or had Lord Christ touched him and bidden him 
			follow, like that disciple who had sat at the receipt of custom, 
			as he sat by the door of some zincroofed chapel, yawning and 
			telling over his church pence? </p>
		<p>The dean repeated the word yet again. </p>
		<p>—Tundish! Well now, that is interesting! </p>
		<p>—The question you asked me a moment ago seems to me 
			more interesting. What is that beauty which the artist struggles 
			to express from lumps of earth, said Stephen coldly. </p>
		<p>The little word seemed to have turned a rapier point of his 
			sensitiveness against this courteous and vigilant foe. He felt 
			with a smart of dejection that the man to whom he was speaking 
			was a countryman of Ben Jonson. He thought: </p>
		<p>—The language in which we are speaking is his before it is 
			mine. How different are the words <hi rend="italic">home, Christ, ale, master</hi>, 
			on his lips and on mine! I cannot speak or write these words 
			without unrest of spirit. His language, so familiar and so 
			foreign, will always be for me an acquired speech. I have not 
			made or accepted its words. My voice holds them at bay. My 
			soul frets in the shadow of his language. </p>
		<p>—And to distinguish between the beautiful and the sublime, 
			the dean added. To distinguish between moral beauty and 
			material beauty. And to inquire what kind of  beauty is proper 
			to each of the various arts. These are some interesting points 
			we might take up. </p>
		<p>Stephen, disheartened suddenly by the dean's firm dry tone, 
			was silent. The dean also was silent: and through the silence a 
			distant noise of many boots and confused voices came up the 
			staircase. </p>
		<p>—In pursuing  these speculations, said the dean conclusively, 
			there is however the danger of perishing of inanition. 
			First you must take your degree. Set that before you as your 
			first aim. Then little by little, you will see your way. I mean in 
			every sense, your way in life and in thinking. It may be uphill 
			pedalling at first. Take Mr Moonan. He was a long time before 
			he got to the top. But he got there. </p>
		<p>—I may not have his talent, said Stephen quietly. </p>
		<p>—You never know, said the dean brightly. We never can 
			say what is in us. I most certainly should not be despondent. 
			<i>Per aspera ad astra.</i> </p>
		<p>He left the hearth quickly and went towards the landing to 
			oversee the arrival of the first arts' class. </p>
		<p>Leaning against the fireplace Stephen heard him greet 
			briskly and impartially every student of the class and could 
			almost see the frank smiles of the coarser students. A desolating 
			pity began to fall like a dew upon his easily embittered 
			heart for this faithful servingman of the knightly Loyola, for 
			this halfbrother of the clergy, more venal than they in speech, 
			more steadfast of soul than they, one whom he would never 
			call his ghostly father: and he thought how this man and his 
			companions had earned the name of worldlings at the hands 
			not of the unworldly only but of the worldly also for having 
			pleaded, during all their history, at the bar of God's justice for 
			the souls of the lax and the lukewarm and the prudent. </p>
		<p>The entry of the professor was signalled by a few rounds of 
			Kentish fire from the heavy boots of those students who sat on 
			the highest tier of the gloomy theatre under the grey cobwebbed 
			windows. The calling of the roll began and the responses 
			to the names were given out in all tones until the name 
			of Peter Byrne was reached. </p>
		<p>—Here! </p>
		<p>A deep base note in response came from the upper tier, 
			followed by coughs of protest along the other benches. </p>
		<p>The professor paused in his reading and called the next 
			name: </p>
		<p>—Cranly! </p>
		<p>No answer. </p>
		<p>—Mr Cranly! </p>
		<p>A smile flew across Stephen's face as he thought of his 
			friend's studies. </p>
		<p>—Try Leopardstown! said a voice from the bench behind. </p>
		<p>Stephen glanced up quickly but Moynihan's snoutish face, 
			outlined on the grey light, was impassive. A formula was given 
			out. Amid the rustling of the notebooks Stephen turned back 
			again and said: </p>
		<p>—Give me some paper for God's sake. </p>
		<p>—Are you as bad as that? asked Moynihan with a broad 
			grin. </p>
		<p>He tore a sheet from his scribbler and passed it down, 
			whispering: </p>
		<p>—In case of necessity any layman or woman can do it. </p>
		<p>The formula which he wrote obediently on the sheet of 
			paper, the coiling and uncoiling calculations of the professor, 
			the spectrelike symbols of force and velocity fascinated and 
			jaded Stephen's mind. He had heard some say that the old 
			professor was an atheist freemason. O the grey dull day! It 
			seemed a limbo of painless patient consciousness through 
			which souls of mathematicians might wander, projecting long 
			slender fabrics from plane to plane of ever rarer and paler 
			twilight, radiating swift eddies to the last verges of a universe 
			ever vaster, farther and more impalpable. </p>
		<p>—So we must distinguish between elliptical and ellipsoidal. 
			Perhaps some of you gentlemen may be familiar with the 
			works of Mr W. S. Gilbert. In one of his songs he speaks of 
			the billiard sharp who is condemned to play: </p>
		<lg type="song">
			<l>On a cloth untrue </l>
			<l>With a twisted cue </l>
			<l>And elliptical billiard balls. </l>
		</lg>
		<p>—He means a ball having the form of the ellipsoid of the 
			principal axes of which I spoke a moment ago. </p>
		<p>Moynihan leaned down towards Stephen's ear and murmured: </p>
		<p>—What price ellipsoidal balls! Chase me, ladies, I'm in the 
			cavalry! </p>
		<p>His fellowstudent's rude humour ran like a gust through the 
			cloister of Stephen's mind, shaking into gay life limp priestly 
			vestments that hung upon the walls, setting them to sway and 
			caper in a sabbath of misrule. The forms of the community 
			emerged from the gustblown vestments, the dean of studies, 
			the portly florid bursar with his cap of grey hair, the president, 
			the little priest with feathery hair who wrote devout verses, the 
			squat peasant form of the professor of economics, the tall 
			form of the young professor of mental science discussing on 
			the landing a case of conscience with his class like a giraffe 
			cropping high leafage among a herd of antelopes, the grave 
			troubled prefect of the sodality, the plump roundheaded 
			professor of Italian with his rogue's eyes. They came ambling 
			and stumbling, tumbling and capering, kilting their gowns for 
			leap frog, holding one another back, shaken with deep fast 
			laughter, smacking one another behind and laughing at their 
			rude malice, calling to one another by familiar nicknames, 
			protesting  with sudden dignity at some rough usage, whispering 
			two and two behind their hands. </p>
		<p>The professor had gone to the glass cases on the sidewall 
			from a shelf of which he took down a set of coils, blew away 
			the dust from many points and, bearing it carefully to the 
			table, held a finger on it while he proceeded with his lecture. 
			He explained that the wires in modern coils were of a compound 
			called platinoid lately discovered by F. W. Martino. </p>
		<p>He spoke clearly the initials and surname of the discoverer. 
			Moynihan whispered from behind: </p>
		<p>—Good old Fresh Water Martin! </p>
		<p>—Ask him, Stephen whispered back with weary humour, if 
			he wants a subject for electrocution. He can have me. </p>
		<p>Moynihan, seeing the professor bend over the coils, rose in 
			his bench and, clacking noiselessly the fingers of his right 
			hand, began to call with the voice of a slobbering urchin: </p>
		<p>—Please, teacher! Please, teacher! This boy is after saying a 
			bad word, teacher. </p>
		<p>—Platinoid, the professor said solemnly, is preferred to 
			German silver because it has a lower coefficient of resistance 
			variation by changes of temperature. The platinoid wire is 
			insulated and the covering of silk that insulates it is wound on 
			the ebonite bobbins just where my finger is. If it were wound 
			single an extra current would be induced in the coils. The 
			bobbins are saturated in hot paraffin wax ... </p>
		<p>A sharp Ulster voice said from the bench below Stephen: </p>
		<p>—Are we  likely to be asked questions on applied science? </p>
		<p>The professor began to juggle gravely with the terms pure 
			science and applied science. A heavybuilt student wearing 
			gold spectacles stared with some wonder at the questioner. 
			Moynihan murmured from behind in his natural voice: </p>
		<p>—Isn't MacAlister a devil for his pound of flesh? </p>
		<p>Stephen looked down coldly on the oblong skull beneath 
			him overgrown with tangled twinecoloured hair. The voice, 
			the accent, the mind of the questioner offended him and he 
			allowed the offence to carry  him towards wilful unkindness, 
			bidding his mind think that the student's father would have 
			done better had he sent his son to Belfast to study and have 
			saved something on the train fare by so doing. </p>
		<p>The oblong skull beneath did not turn to meet this shaft of 
			thought and yet the shaft came back to its bowstring: for he 
			saw in a moment the student's wheypale face. </p>
		<p>—That thought is not mine, he said to himself quickly. It 
			came from the comic Irishman in the bench behind. Patience. 
			Can you say with certitude by whom the soul of your race was 
			bartered and its elect betrayed - by the questioner or  by the 
			mocker? Patience. Remember Epictetus. It is probably in his 
			character to ask such a question at such a moment in such a 
			tone and to pronounce the word <hi rend="italic">science</hi> as a monosyllable. </p>
		<p>The droning voice of the professor continued to wind itself 
			slowly round and round the coils it spoke of, doubling, trebling, 
			quadrupling its somnolent energy as the coil multiplied 
			its ohms of resistance. </p>
		<p>Moynihan's voice called from behind in echo to a distant 
			bell: </p>
		<p>—Closing time, gents! </p>
		<p>The entrance hall was crowded and loud with talk. On a 
			table near the door were two photographs in frames and 
			between them a long roll of paper bearing an irregular tail of 
			signatures. MacCann went briskly to and fro among the students, 
			talking rapidly, answering rebuffs and leading one after 
			another to the table. In the inner hall the dean of studies stood 
			talking to a young professor, stroking his chin gravely and 
			nodding his head. </p>
		<p>Stephen,  checked by the crowd at the door, halted irresolutely. 
			From under the wide falling leaf of a soft hat Cranly's 
			dark eyes were watching him. </p>
		<p>—Have you signed? Stephen asked. </p>
		<p>Cranly closed his long thinlipped mouth, communed with 
			himself an instant and answered: </p>
		<p>—<i>Ego habeo.</i> </p>
		<p>—What is it for? </p>
		<p>—<i>Quod?</i> </p>
		<p>—What is it for? </p>
		<p>Cranly turned his pale face to Stephen and said blandly and 
			bitterly: </p>
		<p>—<i>Per pax universalis.</i> </p>
		<p>Stephen pointed to the Csar's photograph and said: </p>
		<p>—He has the face of a besotted Christ. </p>
		<p>The scorn and anger in his voice brought Cranly's eyes back 
			from a calm survey of the walls of the hall. </p>
		<p>—Are you annoyed? he asked. </p>
		<p>—No, answered Stephen. </p>
		<p>—Are you in bad humour? </p>
		<p>—No. </p>
		<p>—<seg xml:lang="lat"><hi rend="italic">Credo ut vos sanguinarius mendax estis</hi>, said Cranly, <hi rend="italic">quia 
					facies vostra monstrat ut vos in damno malo humore estis.</hi></seg></p>
		<p>Moynihan, on his way to the table, said in Stephen's ear: </p>
		<p>—MacCann is in tiptop form. Ready to shed the last drop. 
			Brandnew world. No stimulants and votes for the bitches. </p>
		<p>Stephen smiled at the manner of this confidence and, when 
			Moynihan had passed, turned again to meet Cranly's eyes. </p>
		<p>—Perhaps you can tell me, he said, why he pours his soul 
			so freely into my ear. Can you? </p>
		<p>A dull scowl appeared on Cranly's forehead. He stared at 
			the table where Moynihan had bent to write his name on the 
			roll, and then said flatly: </p>
		<p>—A sugar! </p>
		<p>—<seg xml:lang="lat"><hi rend="italic">Quis est in malo humore</hi></seg>, said Stephen, <seg xml:lang="lat"><hi rend="italic">ego aut vos?</hi></seg></p>
		<p>Cranly did not take up the taunt. He brooded sourly on his 
			judgment and repeated with the same flat force: </p>
		<p>—A flaming bloody sugar, that's what he is! </p>
		<p>It was his epitaph for all dead friendships and Stephen 
			wondered whether it would ever be spoken in the same tone 
			over his memory. The heavy lumpish phrase sank slowly out 
			of hearing like a stone through a quagmire. Stephen saw it 
			sink as he had seen many another, feeling its heaviness depress 
			his heart. Cranly's speech, unlike that of Davin, had 
			neither rare phrases of Elizabethan English nor quaintly turned 
			versions of Irish idioms. Its drawl was an echo of the quays of 
			Dublin given back by a bleak decaying seaport, its energy an 
			echo of the sacred eloquence of Dublin given back flatly by a 
			Wicklow pulpit. </p>
		<p>The heavy scowl faded from Cranly's face as MacCann 
			marched briskly towards them from the other side of the hall. </p>
		<p>—Here you are! said MacCann cheerily. </p>
		<p>—Here I am! said Stephen. </p>
		<p>—Late as usual. Can you not combine the progressive 
			tendency with a respect for punctuality? </p>
		<p>—That question is out of order, said Stephen. Next business. </p>
		<p>His smiling eyes were fixed on a silverwrapped tablet of 
			milk chocolate which peeped out of the propagandist's breastpocket. 
			A little ring of listeners closed round to hear the war 
			of wits. A lean student with olive skin and lank black hair 
			thrust his face between the two, glancing from one to the other 
			at each phrase and seeming to try to catch each flying phrase 
			in his open moist mouth. Cranly took a small grey handball 
			from his pocket and began to examine it closely, turning it 
			over and over. </p>
		<p>—Next business? said MacCann. Hom! </p>
		<p>He gave a loud cough of laughter, smiled broadly and 
			tugged twice at  the strawcoloured goatee which hung from his 
			blunt chin. </p>
		<p>—The next business is to sign the testimonial. </p>
		<p>—Will you pay me anything if I sign? asked Stephen. </p>
		<p>—I thought you were an idealist, said MacCann. </p>
		<p>The gipsylike student looked about him and addressed the 
			onlookers in an indistinct bleating voice. </p>
		<p>—By hell, that's a queer notion. I consider that notion to be 
			a mercenary notion. </p>
		<p>His voice faded into silence. No heed was paid to his words. 
			He turned his olive face, equine in expression, towards Stephen, 
			inviting him to speak again. </p>
		<p>MacCann began to speak with fluent energy of the Csar's 
			rescript, of Stead, of general disarmament, arbitration in cases 
			of international disputes, of the signs of the times, of the new 
			humanity and the new gospel of life which would make it the 
			business of the community to secure as cheaply as possible 
			the greatest possible happiness of the greatest possible number. </p>
		<p>The gipsy student responded to the close of the period by 
			crying: </p>
		<p>—Three cheers for universal brotherhood! </p>
		<p>—Go on, Temple, said a stout ruddy student near him. I'll 
			stand you a pint after. </p>
		<p>—I'm a believer in universal brotherhood, said Temple, 
			glancing about him out of his dark, oval eyes. Marx is only a 
			bloody cod. </p>
		<p>Cranly gripped his arm tightly to check his tongue, smiling 
			uneasily, and repeated: </p>
		<p>—Easy, easy, easy! </p>
		<p>Temple struggled to free his arm but continued, his mouth 
			flecked by a thin foam: </p>
		<p>—Socialism was founded by an Irishman and the first man 
			in Europe who preached the freedom of thought was Collins. 
			Two hundred years ago. He denounced priestcraft, the philosopher 
			of Middlesex. Three cheers for John Anthony Collins! </p>
		<p>A thin voice from the verge of the ring replied: </p>
		<p>—Pip! pip! </p>
		<p>Moynihan murmured beside Stephen's ear: </p>
		<p>—And what about John Anthony's poor little sister: </p>
		<lg>
			<l>Lottie Collins lost her drawers; </l>
			<l>Won't you kindly lend her yours? </l>
		</lg>
		<p>Stephen laughed and Moynihan, pleased with the result, 
			murmured again: </p>
		<p>—We'll have five bob each way on John Anthony Collins. </p>
		<p>—I am waiting for your answer, said MacCann briefly. </p>
		<p>—The affair doesn't interest me in the least, said Stephen 
			wearily. You know that well. Why do you make a scene about 
			it? </p>
		<p>—Good!  said MacCann, smacking his lips. You are a 
			reactionary then? </p>
		<p>—Do you think you impress me, Stephen asked, when you 
			flourish your wooden sword? </p>
		<p>—Metaphors! said MacCann bluntly. Come to facts. </p>
		<p>Stephen blushed and turned aside. MacCann stood his 
			ground and said with hostile humour: </p>
		<p>—Minor poets, I suppose, are above such trivial questions 
			as the question of universal peace. </p>
		<p>Cranly raised his head and held the handball between the 
			two students by way of a peaceoffering, saying: </p>
		<p>—<i>Pax super totum sanguinarium globum.</i> </p>
		<p>Stephen, moving away the bystanders, jerked his shoulder 
			angrily in the direction of the Csar's image, saying: </p>
		<p>—Keep your icon. If we must have a Jesus, let us have a 
			legitimate Jesus. </p>
		<p>—By hell, that's a good one! said the gipsy student to those 
			about him. That's a fine expression. I like that expression 
			immensely. </p>
		<p>He gulped down the spittle in his throat as if he were gulping 
			down the phrase and, fumbling at the peak of his tweed 
			cap, turned to Stephen, saying: </p>
		<p>—Excuse me, sir, what do you mean by that expression you 
			uttered just now? </p>
		<p>Feeling himself jostled by the students near him, he said to 
			them: </p>
		<p>—I am curious to know now what he meant by that expression. </p>
		<p>He turned again to Stephen and said in a whisper: </p>
		<p>—Do you believe in Jesus? I believe in man. Of course, I 
			don't know if you believe in man. I admire you, sir. I admire 
			the mind of man independent of all religions. Is that your 
			opinion about the mind of Jesus? </p>
		<p>—Go on, Temple, said the stout ruddy student, returning, 
			as was his wont, to his first idea, that pint is waiting for you. </p>
		<p>—He thinks I'm an  imbecile,  Temple explained to Stephen, 
			because I'm a  believer in the power of mind. </p>
		<p>Cranly linked his arms into those of Stephen and his admirer 
			and said: </p>
		<p>—<i>Nos ad manum ballum jocabimus.</i> </p>
		<p>Stephen, in the act of being led away, caught sight of MacCann's 
			flushed bluntfeatured face. </p>
		<p>—My signature is of no account, he said politely. You are 
			right to go your way. Leave me to go mine. </p>
		<p>—Dedalus, said MacCann crisply, I believe you're a good 
			fellow but you have yet to learn the dignity of altruism and the 
			responsibility of the human individual. </p>
		<p>A voice said: </p>
		<p>—Intellectual crankery is better out of this movement than 
			in it. </p>
		<p>Stephen, recognising  the harsh tone of MacAlister's voice, 
			did not turn in the direction of the voice. Cranly pushed solemnly 
			through the throng of students, linking Stephen and 
			Temple like a celebrant attended by his ministers on his way 
			to the altar. </p>
		<p>Temple bent eagerly across Cranly's breast and said: </p>
		<p>—Did you hear MacAlister what he said? That youth is 
			jealous of you. Did you see that? I bet Cranly didn't see that. 
			By hell, I saw that at once. </p>
		<p>As they crossed the inner hall the dean of studies was in  the 
			act of escaping from the student with whom he had been 
			conversing. He stood at the foot of the staircase, a foot on the 
			lowest step, his threadbare  soutane gathered about him for the 
			ascent with womanish care, nodding his head often and repeating: </p>
		<p>—Not a doubt of it, Mr Hackett! Very fine! Not a doubt of 
			it! </p>
		<p>In the middle of the hall the prefect of the college sodality 
			was speaking earnestly, in a soft querulous voice, with a 
			boarder. As he spoke he wrinkled a little his freckled brow 
			and bit, between his phrases, at a tiny bone pencil. </p>
		<p>—I hope the matric men will all come. The first arts men 
			are pretty sure. Second arts too. We must make sure of the 
			newcomers. </p>
		<p>Temple bent again across Cranly, as they were passing 
			through the doorway, and said in a swift whisper: </p>
		<p>—Do you know that he is a married man? He was a married 
			man before they converted him. He has a wife and children 
			somewhere. By hell, I think that's the queerest notion I 
			ever heard! Eh? </p>
		<p>His whisper trailed off into sly cackling laughter. The moment 
			they were through the doorway Cranly seized him rudely 
			by the neck and shook him, saying: </p>
		<p>—You flaming floundering fool! I'll take my dying bible 
			there isn't a bigger bloody ape, do you know, than you in the 
			whole flaming bloody world! </p>
		<p>Temple wriggled in his grip, laughing still with sly content, 
			while Cranly repeated flatly at every rude shake: </p>
		<p>—A flaming flaring  bloody idiot! </p>
		<p>They crossed the weedy garden together. The president, 
			wrapped in a heavy loose cloak, was coming towards them 
			along one of the walks, reading his office. At the end of the 
			walk he halted before turning and raised his eyes. The students 
			saluted, Temple fumbling as before at the peak of his 
			cap. They walked forward in silence. As they neared the alley 
			Stephen could hear the thuds of the players' hands and the wet 
			smacks of the ball and Davin's voice crying out excitedly at 
			each stroke. </p>
		<p>The three students halted round the box on which Davin sat 
			to follow the game. Temple, after a few moments, sidled 
			across to Stephen and said: </p>
		<p>—Excuse me, I wanted to ask you do you believe that Jean 
			Jacques Rousseau was a sincere man? </p>
		<p>Stephen laughed outright. Cranly, picking up the broken 
			stave of a cask from the grass at his foot, turned swiftly and 
			said sternly: </p>
		<p>—Temple, I declare to the living God if you say another 
			word, do you know, to anybody on any subject I'll kill you 
			<i>super spottum</i>. </p>
		<p>—He was like you, I fancy, said Stephen, an emotional 
			man. </p>
		<p>—Blast him, curse him! said Cranly broadly. Don't talk to 
			him at all. Sure, you might as well be talking, do you know, to 
			a flaming chamberpot as talking to Temple. Go home, Temple. 
			For God's sake, go home. </p>
		<p>—I don't care a damn about you, Cranly, answered Temple, 
			moving out of reach of the uplifted stave and pointing at 
			Stephen. He's the only man I see in this institution that has an 
			individual mind. </p>
		<p>—Institution! Individual! cried Cranly. Go home, blast you, 
			for you're a hopeless bloody man. </p>
		<p>—I'm an emotional man, said Temple. That's quite rightly 
			expressed. And I'm proud that I'm an emotionalist. </p>
		<p>He sidled out of the alley, smiling slily. Cranly watched him 
			with a blank expressionless face. </p>
		<p>—Look at him! he said. Did you ever see such a go-by-the-wall? </p>
		<p>His phrase was greeted by a strange laugh from a student 
			who lounged against the wall, his peaked cap down on his eyes. 
			The laugh, pitched in a high key and coming from a so muscular 
			frame, seemed like the whinny of an elephant. The student's 
			body shook all over and, to ease his mirth, he rubbed 
			both his hands delightedly, over  his groins. </p>
		<p>—Lynch is awake, said Cranly. </p>
		<p>Lynch, for answer, straightened himself and thrust forward 
			his chest. </p>
		<p>—Lynch puts out his chest, said Stephen, as a criticism of 
			life. </p>
		<p>Lynch smote himself sonorously on the chest and said: </p>
		<p>—Who has anything to say about my girth? </p>
		<p>Cranly took him at the word and the two began to tussle. 
			When their faces had flushed with the struggle they drew 
			apart, panting. Stephen bent down towards Davin who, intent 
			on the game, had paid no heed to the talk of the others. </p>
		<p>—And how is my little tame goose? he asked. Did he sign 
			too? </p>
		<p>Davin nodded and said: </p>
		<p>—And you, Stevie? </p>
		<p>Stephen shook his head. </p>
		<p>—You're a terrible man, Stevie, said Davin, taking the 
			short pipe from his mouth. Always alone. </p>
		<p>—Now that you have signed the petition for universal 
			peace, said Stephen, I suppose you will burn that little copybook 
			I saw in your room. </p>
		<p>As Davin did not answer Stephen began to quote: </p>
		<p>—Long pace, fianna! Right incline, fianna! Fianna, by 
			numbers, salute, one, two! </p>
		<p>—That's a different question, said Davin. I'm an Irish 
			nationalist, first and foremost. But that's you all out. You're 
			a born sneerer, Stevie. </p>
		<p>—When you make the next rebellion with hurleysticks, said 
			Stephen, and want the indispensable informer, tell me. I can 
			find you a few in this college. </p>
		<p>—I can't understand you, said Davin. One time I hear you 
			talk against English literature. Now you talk against the  Irish 
			informers. What with your name and your ideas ... Are 
			you Irish at all? </p>
		<p>—Come with me now to the office of arms and I will show 
			you the tree of my family, said Stephen. </p>
		<p>—Then be one of us, said Davin. Why don't you learn 
			Irish? Why did you drop out of the league class after the first 
			lesson? </p>
		<p>—You know one reason why, answered Stephen. </p>
		<p>Davin tossed his head and laughed. </p>
		<p>—O, come now, he said. Is it on account of that certain 
			young lady and Father Moran? But that's all in your own 
			mind, Stevie. They were only talking and laughing. </p>
		<p>Stephen paused and laid a friendly hand upon Davin's 
			shoulder. </p>
		<p>—Do you remember, he said, when we knew each other 
			first? The first morning we met you asked me to show you the 
			way to the matriculation class, putting a very strong stress on 
			the first syllable. You remember? Then you used to address 
			the jesuits as father, you remember? I ask myself about you: 
			<i>Is he as innocent as his speech?</i> </p>
		<p>—I'm a simple person, said Davin. You know that. When 
			you told me that night in Harcourt Street those things about 
			your private life, honest to God, Stevie, I was not able to eat 
			my dinner. I was quite bad. I was awake a long time that 
			night. Why did you tell me those things? </p>
		<p>—Thanks, said Stephen. You mean I am a monster. </p>
		<p>—No, said Davin, but I wish you had not told me. </p>
		<p>A tide began to surge beneath the calm surface of Stephen's 
			friendliness. </p>
		<p>—This race and this country and this life produced me, he 
			said. I shall express myself as I am. </p>
		<p>—Try to be one of us, repeated Davin. In your heart you 
			are an Irishman but your pride is too powerful. </p>
		<p>—My ancestors threw off their language and took another, 
			Stephen said. They allowed a handful of foreigners to subject 
			them. Do you fancy I am going to pay in my own life and 
			person debts they made? What for? </p>
		<p>—For our freedom, said Davin. </p>
		<p>—No honourable and sincere man, said Stephen, has given 
			up to you his life and his youth and his affections from the 
			days of Tone to those of Parnell but you sold him to the 
			enemy or failed him in need or reviled him and left him for 
			another. And you invite me to be one of you. I'd see you 
			damned first. </p>
		<p>—They died for their ideals, Stevie, said Davin. Our day 
			will come yet, believe me. </p>
		<p>Stephen, following his own thought, was silent for an instant. </p>
		<p>—The soul is born, he said vaguely, first in those moments 
			I told you of. It has a slow and dark birth, more mysterious 
			than  the birth of the body. When the soul of a man is born in 
			this country there are nets flung at it to hold it back from 
			flight. You talk to me of nationality, language, religion. I shall 
			try to fly by those nets. </p>
		<p>Davin knocked the ashes from his pipe. </p>
		<p>—Too deep for me, Stevie, he said. But a man's country 
			comes first. Ireland first, Stevie. You can be a poet or mystic 
			after. </p>
		<p>—Do you know what Ireland is? asked Stephen with cold 
			violence. Ireland is the old sow that eats her farrow. </p>
		<p>Davin rose from his box and went towards the players, 
			shaking his head sadly. But in a moment his sadness left him 
			and he was hotly disputing with Cranly and the two players 
			who had finished their game. A match of four was arranged, 
			Cranly insisting, however, that his ball should be used. He let 
			it rebound twice or thrice to his hand and struck it strongly 
			and swiftly towards the base of the alley, exclaiming in answer 
			to its thud: </p>
		<p>—Your soul! </p>
		<p>Stephen stood with Lynch till the score began to rise. Then 
			he plucked him by the sleeve to come away. Lynch obeyed, 
			saying: </p>
		<p>—Let us eke go, as Cranly has it. </p>
		<p>Stephen smiled at this sidethrust. They passed back through 
			the garden and out through the hall where the doddering 
			porter was pinning up a notice in the frame. At the foot of the 
			steps they halted and Stephen took a packet of cigarettes from 
			his pocket and offered it to his companion. </p>
		<p>—I know you are poor, he said. </p>
		<p>—Damn your yellow insolence, answered Lynch. </p>
		<p>This second proof of Lynch's culture made Stephen smile 
			again. </p>
		<p>—It was a great day for European culture, he said, when 
			you made up your mind to swear in yellow. </p>
		<p>They lit their cigarettes and turned to the right. After a 
			pause Stephen began: </p>
		<p>—Aristotle has not defined pity and terror. I have. I 
			say ... </p>
		<p>Lynch halted and said bluntly: </p>
		<p>—Stop! I won't listen! I am sick. I was out last night on a 
			yellow drunk with Horan and Goggins. </p>
		<p>Stephen went on: </p>
		<p>—Pity is the feeling which arrests the mind in the presence 
			of whatsoever is grave and constant in human sufferings and 
			unites it with the human sufferer.  Terror is the feeling which 
			arrests the mind in the presence of whatsoever is grave and 
			constant in human sufferings and unites it with the secret 
			cause. </p>
		<p>—Repeat, said Lynch. </p>
		<p>Stephen repeated the definitions slowly. </p>
		<p>—A girl got into a hansom a few days ago, he went on, in 
			London. She was on her way to meet her mother whom she 
			had not seen for many years. At the corner of a street the shaft 
			of a lorry shivered the window of the hansom in the shape of a 
			star. A long fine needle of the shivered glass pierced her heart. 
			She died on the instant. The reporter called it a tragic death. It 
			is not. It is remote from terror and pity according to the terms 
			of my definitions. </p>
		<p>—The tragic emotion, in fact, is a face looking two ways, 
			towards terror and towards pity, both of which are phases of 
			it. You see I use the word <hi rend="italic">arrest</hi>. I mean that the tragic emotion 
			is static. Or rather the dramatic emotion is. The feelings 
			excited by improper art are kinetic, desire or loathing. Desire 
			urges us to possess, to go to something; loathing  urges us to 
			abandon, to go from something. These are kinetic emotions. 
			The arts which excite them, pornographical or didactic, are 
			therefore improper arts. The esthetic emotion (I use the 
			general term) is therefore static. The mind is arrested and 
			raised above desire and loathing. </p>
		<p>—You say that art must not excite desire, said Lynch. I 
			told you that one day I wrote my name in pencil on the backside 
			of the Venus of Praxiteles in the Museum. Was that not 
			desire? </p>
		<p>—I speak of normal natures, said Stephen. You also told 
			me that when you were a boy in that charming carmelite 
			school you ate pieces of dried cowdung. </p>
		<p>Lynch broke again into a whinny of laughter and again 
			rubbed both his hands over his groins but without taking them 
			from his pockets. </p>
		<p>—O I did! I did! he cried. </p>
		<p>Stephen turned towards his companion and looked at him 
			for a moment boldly in the eyes. Lynch, recovering from his 
			laughter, answered his look from his humbled eyes. The long 
			slender flattened skull beneath the long pointed cap brought 
			before Stephen's mind the image of a hooded reptile. The 
			eyes, too, were reptilelike in glint and gaze. Yet at that instant, 
			humbled and alert in their look, they were lit by one tiny 
			human point, the window of a shrivelled soul, poignant and 
			selfembittered. </p>
		<p>—As for that, Stephen said in polite parenthesis, we are all 
			animals. I also am an animal. </p>
		<p>—You are, said Lynch. </p>
		<p>—But we are just now in a mental world, Stephen continued. 
			The desire and loathing excited by improper esthetic 
			means are really unesthetic emotions not only because they 
			are kinetic in character but also because they are not more 
			than physical. Our flesh shrinks from what it dreads and 
			responds to the stimulus of what it desires by a purely reflex 
			action of the nervous system. Our eyelid closes before we are 
			aware that the fly is about to enter our eye. </p>
		<p>—Not always, said Lynch critically. </p>
		<p>—In the same way, said Stephen, your flesh responded to 
			the stimulus of a naked statue but it was, I say, simply a reflex 
			action of the nerves. Beauty expressed by the artist cannot 
			awaken in us an emotion which is kinetic or a sensation which 
			is purely physical. It awakens, or ought to awaken, or induces, 
			or ought to induce, an esthetic stasis, an ideal pity or an ideal 
			terror, a stasis called forth, prolonged and at last dissolved by 
			what I call the rhythm of beauty. </p>
		<p>—What is that exactly? asked Lynch. </p>
		<p>—Rhythm, said Stephen, is the first formal esthetic relation 
			of part to part in any esthetic whole or of an esthetic whole to 
			its part or parts or of any part to the esthetic whole of which it 
			is a part. </p>
		<p>—If that is rhythm, said Lynch, let me hear what you call 
			beauty: and, please remember, though I did eat a cake of 
			cowdung once, that I admire only beauty. </p>
		<p>Stephen raised his cap as if in greeting. Then,  blushing 
			slightly, he laid his hand on Lynch's thick tweed sleeve. </p>
		<p>—We are right, he said, and the others are wrong. To speak 
			of these things and to try to understand their nature and, 
			having understood it, to try slowly and humbly and constantly 
			to express, to press out again, from the gross earth or what it 
			brings forth, from sound and shape and colour which are the 
			prison gates of our soul, an image of the beauty we have come 
			to understand - that is art. </p>
		<p>They had reached the canal bridge and, turning from their 
			course, went on by the trees. A crude grey light, mirrored in 
			the sluggish water, and a smell of wet branches over their 
			heads seemed to war against the course of Stephen's thought. </p>
		<p>—But you have not answered my question, said Lynch. 
			What is art? What is the beauty it expresses? </p>
		<p>—That was the first definition I gave you, you sleepyheaded 
			wretch, said Stephen, when I began to try to think out 
			the matter for myself. Do you remember the night? Cranly 
			lost his temper and began to talk about Wicklow bacon. </p>
		<p>—I remember, said Lynch. He told us about them flaming 
			fat devils of pigs. </p>
		<p>—Art, said Stephen, is the human disposition of sensible or 
			intelligible matter for an esthetic end. You remember the pigs 
			and forget that. You are a distressing pair, you and Cranly. </p>
		<p>Lynch made a grimace at the raw grey sky and said: </p>
		<p>—If I am to listen to your esthetic philosophy give me at 
			least another cigarette. I don't care about it. I don't even care 
			about women. Damn you and damn everything. I want a job 
			of five hundred a year. You can't get me one. </p>
		<p>Stephen handed him the packet of cigarettes. Lynch took the 
			last one that remained, saying simply: </p>
		<p>—Proceed! </p>
		<p>—Aquinas, said Stephen, says that is beautiful the apprehension 
			of which pleases. </p>
		<p>Lynch nodded. </p>
		<p>—I remember that, he said. <seg xml:lang="lat"><hi rend="italic">Pulcra sunt quae visa placent.</hi></seg></p>
		<p>—He uses the word <seg xml:lang="lat"><hi rend="italic">visa</hi></seg>, said Stephen, to cover esthetic 
			apprehensions of all kinds, whether through sight or hearing 
			or through any other avenue of apprehension. This word, 
			though it is vague, is clear enough to keep away good and evil 
			which excite desire and loathing. It means certainly a stasis 
			and not a kinesis. How about the true? It produces also a 
			stasis of the mind. You would not write your name in pencil 
			across the hypothenuse of a rightangled triangle. </p>
		<p>—No, said Lynch, give me the hypothenuse of the Venus of 
			Praxiteles. </p>
		<p>—Static therefore, said Stephen. Plato, I believe, said that 
			beauty is the splendour of truth. I don't think that it has a 
			meaning but the true and the beautiful are akin. Truth is 
			beheld by the intellect which is appeased by the most satisfying 
			relations of the intelligible:  beauty is beheld by the imagination 
			which is appeased by the most satisfying relations of 
			the sensible. The first step in the direction of truth is to 
			understand the frame and scope of the intellect itself, to comprehend 
			the act itself of intellection. Aristotle's entire system of 
			philosophy rests upon his book of psychology and that, I 
			think, rests on his statement that the same attribute cannot at 
			the same time and in the same connection belong to and not 
			belong to the same subject. The first step in the direction of 
			beauty is to understand the frame and scope of the imagination, 
			to comprehend the act itself of esthetic apprehension. Is 
			that clear? </p>
		<p>—But what is beauty? asked Lynch impatiently. Out with 
			another definition. Something we see and like! Is that the best 
			you and Aquinas can do? </p>
		<p>—Let us take woman, said Stephen. </p>
		<p>—Let us take her! said Lynch fervently. </p>
		<p>—The Greek, the Turk, the Chinese, the Copt, the Hottentot, 
			said Stephen, all admire a different type of female beauty. 
			That seems to be a maze out of which we cannot escape. I see 
			however two ways out. One is this hypothesis: that every 
			physical quality admired by men in women is in direct connection 
			with the manifold functions of women for the propagation 
			of the species. It may be so. The world, it seems, is drearier 
			than even you, Lynch, imagined. For my part I dislike that 
			way out. It leads to eugenics rather than to esthetic. It leads 
			you out of the maze into a new gaudy lectureroom where MacCann, 
			with one hand on <hi rend="italic">The Origin of Species</hi> and the other 
			hand on the new testament, tells you that you admired the 
			great flanks of Venus because you felt that she would bear you 
			burly offspring and admired her great breasts because you felt 
			that she would give  good milk to her children and yours. </p>
		<p>—Then MacCann is a sulphuryellow liar, said Lynch 
			energetically. </p>
		<p>—There remains another way out, said Stephen, laughing. </p>
		<p>—To wit? said Lynch. </p>
		<p>—This hypothesis, Stephen began. </p>
		<p>A long dray laden with old iron came round the corner of 
			sir Patrick Dun's hospital covering the end of Stephen's 
			speech with the harsh roar of jangled and rattling metal. 
			Lynch closed his ears and gave out oath after oath till the dray 
			had passed. Then he turned on his heel rudely. Stephen turned 
			also and waited for a few moments till his companion's illhumour 
			had had its vent. </p>
		<p>—This hypothesis, Stephen repeated, is the other way out: 
			that, though the same object may not seem beautiful to all 
			people, all people who admire a beautiful object find in it 
			certain relations which satisfy and coincide with the stages 
			themselves of all esthetic apprehension. These relations of the 
			sensible, visible to you through one form and to me through 
			another, must be therefore the necessary qualities of beauty. 
			Now, we can return to our old friend saint Thomas for another 
			pennyworth of wisdom. </p>
		<p>Lynch laughed. </p>
		<p>—It amuses me vastly, he said, to hear you quoting him 
			time after time like a jolly round friar. Are you laughing in 
			your sleeve? </p>
		<p>—MacAlister, answered Stephen, would call my esthetic 
			theory applied Aquinas. So far as this side of esthetic philosophy 
			extends Aquinas will carry me all along the line. When we 
			come to the phenomena of artistic conception, artistic gestation 
			and artistic reproduction I require a new terminology and 
			a new personal experience. </p>
		<p>—Of course, said Lynch. After all Aquinas, in spite of his 
			intellect,  was exactly a good round  friar. But you will tell me 
			about the new personal experience and new terminology some 
			other day. Hurry up and finish the first part. </p>
		<p>—Who knows? said Stephen, smiling. Perhaps Aquinas 
			would understand me better than you. He was a poet himself. 
			He wrote a hymn for Maundy Thursday. It begins with the 
			words <seg xml:lang="lat"><hi rend="italic">Pange lingua gloriosi</hi></seg>. They say it is the highest glory 
			of the hymnal. It is an intricate and soothing hymn.  I like it: 
			but there is no hymn that can be put beside that mournful and 
			majestic processional song, the <seg xml:lang="lat"><hi rend="italic">Vexilla Regis</hi></seg> of <seg xml:lang="lat">Venantius 
			Fortunatus</seg>. </p>
		<p>Lynch began to sing softly and solemnly in a deep bass 
			voice: </p>

		<seg xml:lang="lat">
		<lg type="song">
			<l>Impleta sunt quae concinit </l>
			<l>David fideli carmine </l>
			<l>Dicendo nationibus </l>
			<l>Regnavit a ligno Deus. </l>
		</lg>
		</seg>

		<p>—That's great! he said, well pleased. Great music! </p>
		<p>They turned into Lower Mount Street. A few steps from the 
			corner a fat young man, wearing a silk neckcloth, saluted them 
			and stopped. </p>
		<p>—Did you hear the results of the exams? he asked. Griffin 
			was plucked. Halpin and O'Flynn are through the home civil. 
			Moonan got fifth place in the Indian. O'Shaughnessy got 
			fourteenth. The Irish fellows in Clarke's gave them a feed last 
			night. They all ate curry. </p>
		<p>His pallid bloated face expressed benevolent malice and, as 
			he had advanced through his tidings of success, his small 
			fatencircled eyes vanished out of sight and his weak wheezing 
			voice out of hearing. </p>
		<p>In reply to a question of Stephen's his eyes and his voice 
			came forth again from their lurkingplaces. </p>
		<p>—Yes, MacCullagh and I, he said. He's taking pure mathematics 
			and I'm taking constitutional history. There are twenty 
			subjects. I'm taking botany too. You know I'm a member of 
			the field club. </p>
		<p>He drew back from the other two in a stately fashion and 
			placed a plump woollengloved hand on his breast, from which 
			muttered wheezing laughter at once broke forth. </p>
		<p>—Bring us a few turnips and onions the next time you go 
			out, said Stephen drily, to make a stew. </p>
		<p>The fat student laughed indulgently and said: </p>
		<p>—We are all  highly respectable people in the field club. 
			Last Saturday we went out to Glenmalure, seven of us. </p>
		<p>—With women, Donovan? said Lynch. </p>
		<p>Donovan again laid his hand on his chest and said: </p>
		<p>—Our end is the acquisition of knowledge. </p>
		<p>Then he said quickly: </p>
		<p>—I hear you are writing some essay about esthetics. </p>
		<p>Stephen made a vague gesture of denial. </p>
		<p>—Goethe and Lessing, said Donovan, have written a lot on 
			that subject, the classical school and the romantic school and 
			all that. The <hi rend="italic">Laocoon</hi> interested me very much when I read it. 
			Of course it is idealistic, German, ultraprofound. </p>
		<p>Neither of the others spoke. Donovan took leave of them 
			urbanely. </p>
		<p>—I must go, he said softly and benevolently. I have a 
			strong suspicion, amounting almost to a conviction, that my 
			sister intended to make pancakes today for the dinner of the 
			Donovan family. </p>
		<p>—Goodbye, Stephen said in his wake. Don't forget the 
			turnips for me and my mate. </p>
		<p>Lynch gazed after him, his lip curling in slow scorn till his 
			face resembled a devil's mask: </p>
		<p>—To think that that yellow pancakeeating excrement can 
			get a good job, he said at length, and I have to smoke cheap 
			cigarettes! </p>
		<p>They turned their faces towards Merrion Square and went 
			on for a little in silence. </p>
		<p>—To finish what I was saying about beauty, said Stephen, 
			the most satisfying relations of the sensible must therefore 
			correspond to the necessary phases of artistic apprehension. 
			Find these and you find the qualities of universal beauty. 
			Aquinas says: <seg xml:lang="lat"><hi rend="italic">ad pulcritudinem tria requiruntur, integritas, 
			consonantia, claritas</hi></seg>. I translate it so: <hi rend="italic">Three things are needed 
			for beauty, wholeness, harmony and radiance</hi>. Do these correspond 
			to the phases of apprehension? Are you following? </p>
		<p>—Of course, I am, said Lynch. If you think I have an 
			excrementitious intelligence run after Donovan and ask him to 
			listen to you. </p>
		<p>Stephen pointed to a basket which a butcher's boy had 
			slung inverted on his head. </p>
		<p>—Look at that basket, he said. </p>
		<p>—I see it, said Lynch. </p>
		<p>—In order to see that basket, said Stephen, your mind first 
			of all separates the basket from the rest of the visible universe 
			which is not the basket. The first phase of apprehension is a 
			bounding line drawn about the object to be apprehended. An 
			esthetic image is presented to us either in space or in time. 
			What is audible is presented in time, what is visible is presented 
			in space. But, temporal or spatial, the esthetic image is 
			first luminously apprehended as selfbounded and selfcontained 
			upon the immeasurable background of space or time 
			which is not it. You apprehend it as > thing. You see it as 
			one whole. You apprehend its wholeness. That is <seg xml:lang="lat"><hi rend="italic">integritas</hi></seg>. </p>
		<p>—Bull's eye! said Lynch, laughing. Go on. </p>
		<p>—Then, said Stephen, you pass from point to point, led by 
			its formal lines; you apprehend it as balanced part against part 
			within its limits; you feel the rhythm of its structure. In other 
			words the synthesis of immediate perception is followed by 
			the analysis of apprehension. Having first felt that it is > 
			thing you feel now that it is a <hi rend="italic">thing</hi>. You apprehend it as 
			complex, multiple, divisible, separable, made up of its parts, 
			the result of its parts and their sum, harmonious. That is 
			<i>consonantia</i>. </p>
		<p>—Bull's eye again! said Lynch wittily. Tell me now what is 
			<i>claritas</i> and you win the cigar. </p>
		<p>—The connotation of the word, Stephen said, is rather 
			vague. Aquinas uses a term which seems to be inexact. It 
			baffled me for a long time. It would lead you to believe that 
			he had in mind symbolism or idealism, the supreme quality of 
			beauty being a light from some other world, the idea of which 
			the matter is but the shadow, the reality of which it is but the 
			symbol. I thought he might mean that <seg xml:lang="lat"><hi rend="italic">claritas</hi></seg> is the artistic 
			discovery and representation of the divine purpose in anything 
			or a force of generalisation which would make the esthetic 
			image a universal one, make it outshine its proper conditions. 
			But that is literary talk. I understand it so. When you have 
			apprehended that basket as one thing and have then  analysed 
			it according to its form and apprehended it as a thing you 
			make the only synthesis which is logically and esthetically 
			permissible. You see that it is that thing which it is and no 
			other thing. The radiance of which he speaks is the scholastic 
			<seg xml:lang="lat"><hi rend="italic">quidditas</hi></seg>, the <hi rend="italic">whatness</hi> of a thing. This supreme quality is 
			felt by the artist when the esthetic image is first conceived in his 
			imagination. The mind in that mysterious instant Shelley 
			likened beautifully to a fading coal. The instant wherein that 
			supreme quality of beauty, the clear radiance of the esthetic 
			image, is apprehended luminously by the mind which has been 
			arrested by its wholeness and fascinated by its harmony is the 
			luminous silent stasis of esthetic pleasure, a spiritual state very 
			like to that cardiac condition which the Italian physiologist 
			Luigi Galvani, using a phrase almost as beautiful as Shelley's, 
			called the enchantment of the heart. </p>
		<p>Stephen paused and, though his companion did not speak, 
			felt that his words had called up around them a thoughtenchanted 
			silence. </p>
		<p>—What I have said, he began again, refers to beauty in the 
			wider sense of the word, in the sense which the word has in 
			the literary tradition. In the marketplace it has another sense. 
			When we speak of beauty in the second sense of the term our 
			judgment is influenced in the first place by the art itself and by 
			the form of that art. The image, it is clear, must be set between 
			the mind or senses of the  artist himself and the mind or 
			senses of others. If you bear this in memory you will see that 
			art necessarily divides itself into three forms progressing from 
			one to the next. These forms are: the lyrical form, the form 
			wherein the artist presents his image in immediate relation to 
			himself; the epical form, the form wherein he presents his 
			image in mediate relation to himself and to others; the dramatic 
			form, the form wherein he presents his image in immediate 
			relation to others. </p>
		<p>—That you told me a few nights ago, said Lynch, and we 
			began the famous discussion. </p>
		<p>—I have a book at home, said Stephen, in which I have 
			written down questions which are more amusing than yours 
			were. In finding the answers to them I found the theory of 
			esthetic which I am trying to explain. Here are some questions 
			I set myself: <hi rend="italic">Is a chair finely made tragic or comic? Is the 
			portrait of Mona Lisa good if I desire to see it? Is the bust of
			Sir Philip Crampton lyrical, epical or dramatic? Can excrement 
			or a child or a louse be a work of art? If not, why not?</hi> </p>
		<p>—Why not, indeed? said Lynch, laughing. </p>
		<p>—<i>If a man hacking in fury at a block of wood</i>, Stephen 
			continued, > 
			<i>of art? If not, why not?</i> </p>
		<p>—That's a lovely one, said  Lynch, laughing again. That has 
			the true scholastic stink. </p>
		<p>—Lessing, said Stephen, should not have taken a group of 
			statues to write of. The art, being inferior, does not present the 
			forms I spoke of distinguished clearly one from another. Even 
			in literature, the highest and most spiritual art, the forms are 
			often confused. The lyrical form is in fact the simplest verbal 
			vesture of an instant of emotion, a rhythmical cry such as ages 
			ago cheered on the man who pulled at the oar or dragged 
			stones up a slope. He who utters it is more conscious of the 
			instant of emotion than of himself as feeling emotion. The 
			simplest epical form is seen emerging out of lyrical literature 
			when the artist prolongs and broods upon himself as the 
			centre of an epical event and this form progresses till the 
			centre of emotional gravity is equidistant from the artist 
			himself and from others. The narrative is no longer purely 
			personal. The personality of the artist passes into the narration 
			itself, flowing round and round the persons and the action 
			like a vital sea. This progress you will see easily in that old 
			English ballad > which begins in the first person 
			and ends in the third person. The dramatic form is reached 
			when the vitality which has flowed and eddied round each 
			person fills every person with such vital force that he or she 
			assumes a proper and intangible esthetic life. The personality 
			of the artist, at first a cry or a cadence or a mood and then 
			a fluid and lambent narrative, finally refines itself out of existence, 
			impersonalises itself, so to speak. The esthetic image in 
			the dramatic form is life purified in and reprojected from the 
			human imagination. The mystery of esthetic like that of material 
			creation is accomplished. The artist, like the God of the 
			creation, remains within or behind or beyond or above his 
			handiwork, invisible, refined out of existence, indifferent, 
			paring his fingernails. </p>
		<p>—Trying to refine them also out of existence, said Lynch. </p>
		<p>A fine rain began to fall from the high veiled sky and they 
			turned into the duke's lawn, to reach the national library 
			before the shower came. </p>
		<p>—What do you mean, Lynch asked surlily, by prating 
			about beauty and the imagination in this miserable Godforsaken 
			island? No wonder the artist retired within or behind 
			his handiwork after having perpetrated this country. </p>
		<p>The rain fell faster. When they passed through the passage 
			beside the royal Irish academy they found many students 
			sheltering under the arcade of the library. Cranly, leaning 
			against a pillar, was picking his teeth with a sharpened match, 
			listening to some companions. Some girls stood near the 
			entrance door. Lynch whispered to Stephen: </p>
		<p>—Your beloved is  here. </p>
		<p>Stephen took his place silently on the step below the group 
			of students, heedless of the rain which fell fast, turning his 
			eyes towards her  from time to time. She too stood silently 
			among her companions. She has no priest to flirt with, he 
			thought with conscious bitterness, remembering how he had 
			seen her last. Lynch was right. His mind, emptied of theory 
			and courage, lapsed back into a listless peace. </p>
		<p>He heard the students talking among themselves. They 
			spoke of two friends who had passed the final medical examination, 
			of the chances of getting places on ocean liners, of 
			poor and rich practices. </p>
		<p>—That's all a  bubble. An Irish country practice is better. </p>
		<p>—Hynes was two years in Liverpool and he says the same. 
			A frightful hole he said it was. Nothing but midwifery cases. 
			Half a crown cases. </p>
		<p>—Do you mean to say it is better to have a job here in the 
			country than in a rich city like that? I know a fellow ... </p>
		<p>—Hynes has no brains. He got through by stewing, pure 
			stewing. </p>
		<p>—Don't mind him. There's  plenty of money to be made in a 
			big commercial city. </p>
		<p>—Depends on the practice. </p>
		<p>—<i>Ego credo ut vita pauperum est simpliciter atrox, simpliciter</i> 
			<i>sanguinarius atrox, in Liverpoolio.</i> </p>
		<p>Their voices reached his ears as if from a distance in interrupted 
			pulsation. She was preparing to go away with her 
			companions. </p>
		<p>The  quick light shower had drawn off, tarrying in clusters of 
			diamonds among the shrubs of the quadrangle where an 
			exhalation  was breathed forth by the blackened earth. Their 
			trim boots prattled as they stood on the steps of the colonnade, 
			talking quietly and gaily, glancing at the clouds, holding 
			their umbrellas at cunning angles against the few last raindrops, 
			closing them again, holding their skirts demurely. </p>
		<p>And if he had judged her harshly? If her life were a simple 
			rosary of hours, her life simple and strange as a bird's life, gay 
			in the morning, restless all day, tired at sundown? Her heart 
			simple and wilful  as a bird's heart? </p>

		<p>Towards dawn he awoke. O what sweet music! His soul 
			was all dewy wet. Over his limbs in sleep pale cool waves of 
			light had passed. He lay still, as if his soul lay amid cool waters, 
			conscious of faint sweet music. His mind was waking 
			slowly to a tremulous morning knowledge, a morning inspiration. 
			A spirit filled him, pure as the purest water, sweet as 
			dew, moving as music. But how faintly it was inbreathed, how 
			passionlessly, as if the seraphim themselves were breathing 
			upon him! His soul was waking slowly, fearing to awake 
			wholly. It was that windless hour of dawn when madness 
			wakes and strange plants open to the light and the moth flies 
			forth silently. </p>
		<p>An enchantment of the heart! The night had been enchanted. 
			In a dream or vision he had known the ecstasy of 
			seraphic life. Was it an instant of enchantment only or long 
			hours and days and years and ages? </p>
		<p>The instant of inspiration seemed now to be reflected from 
			all sides at once from a multitude of cloudy circumstance of 
			what had happened or of what might have happened. The 
			instant flashed forth like a point of light and now from cloud 
			on cloud of vague circumstance confused form  was veiling 
			softly its afterglow. O! In the virgin womb of the imagination 
			the word was made flesh. Gabriel the  seraph had come to the 
			virgin's chamber. An afterglow deepened within his spirit, 
			whence the white flame had passed, deepening to a rose and 
			ardent light. That rose and ardent light was her strange wilful 
			heart, strange that no man had known or would know, wilful 
			from before the beginning of the world: and lured by that 
			ardent roselike glow the choirs of the seraphim were falling 
			from heaven. </p>
		<lg>
			<l>Are you not weary of ardent ways, </l>
			<l>Lure of the fallen seraphim? </l>
			<l>Tell no more of enchanted days. </l>
		</lg>
		<p>The verses passed from his mind to his lips and, murmuring 
			them over, he felt the rhythmic movement of a villanelle pass 
			through them. The roselike glow sent forth its rays of rhyme; 
			ways, days, blaze, praise, raise. Its rays burned up the world, 
			consumed the hearts of men and angels: the rays from the 
			rose that was her wilful heart. </p>
		<lg>
			<l>Your eyes have set man's heart ablaze </l>
			<l>And you have had your will of him. </l>
			<l>Are you not weary of ardent ways? </l>
		</lg>
		<p>And then? The rhythm died away, ceased, began again to 
			move and beat. And then? Smoke, incense ascending from the 
			altar of the world. </p>
		<lg>
			<l>Above the flame the smoke of praise </l>
			<l>Goes up from ocean rim to rim. </l>
			<l>Tell no more of enchanted days. </l>
		</lg>
		<p>Smoke went up from the whole earth, from the vapoury 
			oceans, smoke of her praise. The earth was like a swinging 
			smoking swaying censer, a ball of incense, an ellipsoidal ball. 
			The rhythm died out at once; the cry of his heart was broken. 
			His lips began to murmur the first verses over and over; then 
			went on stumbling through half verses, stammering and 
			baffled; then stopped. The heart's cry was broken. </p>
		<p>The veiled windless hour had passed and behind the panes 
			of the naked window the morning light was gathering. A bell 
			beat faintly very far away. A bird twittered; two birds, three. 
			The bell and the bird ceased: and the dull white light  spread 
			itself east and west, covering the world, covering the roselight 
			in his heart. </p>
		<p>Fearing to lose all, he raised himself suddenly on his elbow 
			to look for paper and pencil. There was neither on the table; 
			only the soupplate he had eaten the rice from for supper and 
			the candlestick with its tendrils of tallow and its paper socket, 
			singed by the last flame. He stretched his arm wearily towards 
			the foot of the bed, groping with his hand in the pockets of the 
			coat that hung there. His fingers found a pencil and then a 
			cigarette packet.  He  lay back and, tearing open the packet, 
			placed the last cigarette on the windowledge and began to 
			write out the stanzas of the villanelle in small neat letters on 
			the rough cardboard surface. </p>
		<p>Having written them out he lay back on the lumpy pillow, 
			murmuring them again. The lumps of knotted flock under his 
			head reminded him of the lumps of knotted horsehair in the 
			sofa of her parlour on which he used to sit, smiling or serious, 
			asking himself why he had come, displeased with her and with 
			himself, confounded by the print of the Sacred Heart above 
			the untenanted sideboard. He saw her approach him in a lull 
			of the talk and beg him to sing one of his curious songs. Then 
			he saw himself sitting at the old piano, striking chords softly 
			from its speckled keys and singing, amid the talk which had 
			risen again in the room, to her who leaned beside the mantelpiece 
			a dainty song of the Elizabethans, a sad and sweet loth 
			to depart, the victory chant of Agincourt, the happy air of 
			Greensleeves. While he sang and she listened, or feigned to 
			listen, his heart was at rest but when the quaint old songs had 
			ended and he heard again the voices in the room he remembered 
			his own sarcasm: the house where young men are called 
			by their christian names a little too soon. </p>
		<p>At certain instants her eyes seemed about to trust him but 
			he had waited in vain. She passed now dancing lightly across 
			his memory as she had been that night at the carnival ball, her 
			white dress a little lifted, a white spray nodding in her hair. 
			She danced lightly in the round. She was dancing towards him 
			and, as she came, her eyes were a little averted and a faint 
			glow was on her cheek. At the pause in the chain of hands her 
			hand had lain in his an instant, a soft merchandise. </p>
		<p>—You are a great stranger now. </p>
		<p>—Yes. I was born to be a monk. </p>
		<p>—I am afraid you are a heretic. </p>
		<p>—Are you much afraid? </p>
		<p>For answer she had danced away from him along the chain 
			of hands, dancing lightly and discreetly, giving herself to none. 
			The white spray nodded to her dancing and when she was in 
			shadow the glow was deeper on her cheek. </p>
		<p>A monk! His own image started forth a profaner of the 
			cloister, a heretic franciscan, willing and willing not to serve, 
			spinning like Gherardino da Borgo San Donnino, a lithe web 
			of sophistry and whispering in her ear. </p>
		<p>No, it was not his image. It was like the image of the young 
			priest in whose company he had seen her last, looking at him 
			out of dove's eyes, toying with the pages of her Irish phrasebook. </p>
		<p>—Yes, yes, the ladies are coming round to us. I can see it 
			every day. The ladies are with us. The best helpers the language 
			has. </p>
		<p>—And the church, Father Moran? </p>
		<p>—The church too. Coming round too. The work is going 
			ahead there too. Don't fret about the church. </p>
		<p>Bah! he had done well to leave the room in disdain. He had 
			done well not to salute her on the steps of the library. He had 
			done well to leave her to flirt with her priest, to toy with a 
			church which was the scullerymaid of christendom. </p>
		<p>Rude brutal anger routed the last lingering instant of ecstasy 
			from his soul. It broke up violently her fair image and 
			flung the fragments on all sides. On all sides distorted 
			reflections of her image started from his memory: the flower-girl 
			in the ragged dress with damp coarse hair and a hoyden's 
			face who had called herself his own girl and begged his handsel, 
			the kitchengirl in the next house who sang over the clatter 
			of her plates with the drawl of a country singer the first bars of 
			<i>By Killarney's Lakes and Fells</i>, a girl who had laughed gaily to 
			see him stumble when the iron grating in the footpath near 
			Cork Hill had caught the broken sole of his shoe, a girl he had 
			glanced at, attracted by her small ripe mouth, as she passed 
			out of Jacob's biscuit factory, who had cried to him over her 
			shoulder: </p>
		<p>—Do you like what you seen of me, straight hair and curly 
			eyebrows? </p>
		<p>And yet he felt that, however he might revile and mock her 
			image, his anger was also a form of homage. He had left the 
			classroom in disdain that was not wholly sincere, feeling that 
			perhaps the secret of her race lay behind those dark eyes upon 
			which her long lashes flung a quick shadow. He had told 
			himself bitterly as he walked through the streets that she was a 
			figure of the womanhood of her country, a batlike soul waking 
			to the consciousness of itself in darkness and secrecy and 
			loneliness, tarrying awhile, loveless and sinless, with her mild 
			lover and leaving him to whisper of innocent transgressions in 
			the latticed ear of a priest. His anger against her found vent in 
			coarse railing at her paramour, whose name and voice and 
			features offended his baffled pride: a priested peasant, with a 
			brother a policeman in Dublin and a brother a potboy in 
			Moycullen. To him she would unveil her soul's shy nakedness, 
			to one who was but schooled in the discharging of a formal 
			rite rather than to him, a priest of eternal imagination, transmuting 
			the daily bread of experience into the radiant body of 
			everliving life. </p>
		<p>The radiant image of the eucharist united again in an instant 
			his bitter and despairing thoughts, their cries arising 
			unbroken in a hymn of thanksgiving. </p>
		<lg>
			<l>Our broken cries and mournful lays </l>
			<l>Rise in one eucharistic hymn. </l>
			<l>Are you not weary of ardent ways? </l>
			<l>While sacrificing hands upraise </l>
			<l>The chalice flowing to the brim, </l>
			<l>Tell no more of enchanted days. </l>
		</lg>
		<p>He spoke the verses aloud from the first lines till the music 
			and rhythm suffused his mind, turning it to quiet indulgence; 
			then copied them painfully to feel them the better by seeing 
			them; then lay back on his bolster. </p>
		<p>The full morning light had come. No sound was to be 
			heard: but he knew that all around him life was about to 
			awaken in common noises, hoarse voices, sleepy prayers. 
			Shrinking from that life he turned towards the wall, making a 
			cowl of the blanket and staring at the great overblown scarlet 
			flowers of the tattered wallpaper. He tried to warm his perishing 
			joy in their scarlet glow, imagining a roseway from where 
			he lay upwards to heaven all strewn  with scarlet flowers. 
			Weary! Weary! He too was weary of ardent ways. </p>
		<p>A gradual warmth, a languorous weariness passed over 
			him, descending along his spine from his closely cowled  head. 
			He felt it descend and, seeing himself as he lay, smiled. Soon 
			he would sleep. </p>
		<p>He had written verses for her again after ten years. Ten 
			years before she had worn her shawl cowlwise about her head, 
			sending sprays of her warm breath into the night air, tapping 
			her foot upon the glassy road. It was the last tram; the lank 
			brown horses knew it and shook their bells to the clear night 
			in admonition. The conductor talked with the driver, both 
			nodding often in the green light of the lamp. They stood on 
			the steps of the tram, he on the upper, she on the lower. She 
			came up to his step many times between their phrases and 
			went down again and once or twice remained beside him 
			forgetting to go down and then went down. Let be! Let be! </p>
		<p>Ten years from that wisdom of children to his folly. If he 
			sent her the verses? They would be read out at breakfast amid 
			the tapping of eggshells. Folly indeed! The brothers would 
			laugh and try to wrest the page from each other with their 
			strong hard fingers. The suave priest, her uncle, seated in 
			his armchair, would hold the page at arm's length, read it 
			smiling and approve of the literary form. </p>
		<p>No, no: that was folly. Even if he sent her the verses she 
			would not show them to others. No, no: she could not. </p>
		<p>He began to feel that he had wronged her. A sense of her 
			innocence moved him almost to pity her, an innocence he had 
			never understood till he had come to the knowledge of it 
			through sin, an innocence which she too had not understood 
			while she was innocent or before the strange humiliation of 
			her nature had first come upon her. Then first her soul had 
			begun to live as his soul had when he had first sinned: and a 
			tender compassion filled his heart as he remembered her frail 
			pallor and her eyes, humbled and saddened by the dark shame 
			of womanhood. </p>
		<p>While his soul had passed from ecstasy to languor where 
			had she been? Might it be, in the mysterious ways of spiritual 
			life, that her soul at those same moments had been conscious 
			of his homage? It might be. </p>
		<p>A glow of desire kindled again his soul and fired and 
			fulfilled all his body. Conscious of his desire she was waking 
			from odorous sleep, the temptress of his villanelle. Her eyes, 
			dark and with a look of languor, were opening to his eyes. Her 
			nakedness yielded to him, radiant, warm, odorous and lavishlimbed, 
			enfolded him like a shining cloud, enfolded him like 
			water with a liquid life: and like a cloud of vapour or like 
			waters circumfluent in space the liquid letters of speech, 
			symbols of the element of mystery, flowed forth over his 
			brain. </p>
		<lg>
			<l>Are you not weary of ardent ways, </l>
			<l>Lure of the fallen seraphim? </l>

		<p>What birds were they? He stood on the steps of the library 
			to look at them, leaning wearily on his ashplant. They flew 
			round and round the jutting shoulder of a house in Molesworth 
			Street. The air of the late March evening made clear 
			their flight, their dark darting quivering bodies flying clearly 
			against the sky as against a limphung cloth of smoky tenuous 
			blue. </p>
		<p>He watched their flight; bird after bird: a dark flash, a 
			swerve, a flash again, a dart aside, a curve, a flutter of wings. 
			He tried to count them before all their darting quivering 
			bodies passed: six, ten, eleven: and wondered were they odd 
			or even in number. Twelve, thirteen: for two came wheeling 
			down from the upper sky. They were flying high and low but 
			ever round and round in straight and curving lines and ever 
			flying from left to right, circling about a temple of air. </p>
		<p>He  listened to the cries: like the squeak of mice behind the 
			wainscot: a shrill twofold note. But the notes were long and 
			shrill and whirring, unlike the cry of vermin, falling a third or 
			a fourth and trilled as the flying beaks clove the air. Their cry 
			was shrill and clear and fine and falling like threads of silken 
			light unwound from whirring spools. </p>
		<p>The inhuman clamour soothed his ears in which his 
			mother's sobs and reproaches murmured insistently and the 
			dark frail quivering bodies wheeling and fluttering and swerving 
			round an airy temple of the tenuous sky soothed his eyes 
			which still saw the image of his mother's face. </p>
		<p>Why was he gazing upwards from the steps of the porch, 
			hearing their shrill twofold cry, watching their flight? For an 
			augury of good or evil? A phrase of Cornelius Agrippa flew 
			through his mind and then there flew hither and thither shapeless 
			thoughts from Swedenborg on the correspondence of 
			birds to things of the intellect and of how the creatures of the 
			air have their knowledge and know their times and seasons 
			because they, unlike man, are in the order of their life and 
			have not perverted that order by reason. </p>
		<p>And for ages men had gazed upward as he was gazing at 
			birds in flight. The colonnade above him made him think 
			vaguely of an ancient temple and the ashplant on which he 
			leaned wearily of the curved stick of an augur. A sense of fear 
			of the unknown moved in the heart of his weariness, a fear of 
			symbols and portents, of the hawklike man whose name he 
			bore soaring out of his captivity on osierwoven wings, of 
			Thoth, the god of writers, writing with a reed upon a tablet 
			and bearing on his narrow ibis head the cusped moon. </p>
		<p>He smiled as he thought of the god's image for it made him 
			think of a bottlenosed judge in a wig, putting commas into a 
			document which he held at arm's length and he knew that he 
			would not have remembered the god's name but that it was 
			like an Irish oath. It was folly. But was it for this folly that he 
			was about to leave for ever the house of prayer and prudence 
			into which he had been born and the order of life out of which 
			he had come? </p>
		<p>They came back with shrill cries over the jutting shoulder of 
			the house, flying darkly against the fading air. What birds were 
			they? He thought that they must be swallows who had come 
			back from the south. Then he was to go away for they were 
			birds ever going and coming, building ever an unlasting home 
			under the eaves of men's houses and ever leaving the homes 
			they had built to wander. </p>
		<lg>
			<l>Bend down your faces, Oona and Aleel, </l>
			<l>I gaze upon them as the swallow gazes </l>
			<l>Upon the nest under the eave before </l>
			<l>He wander the loud waters. </l>
		</lg>
		<p>A soft liquid joy like the noise of many waters flowed over 
			his memory and he felt in his heart the soft peace of silent 
			spaces of fading tenuous sky above the waters, of oceanic 
			silence, of swallows flying through the seadusk over the flowing 
			waters. </p>
		<p>A soft liquid joy flowed through the words where the soft 
			long vowels hurtled noiselessly and fell away, lapping and 
			flowing back and ever shaking the white bells of their waves in 
			mute chime and mute peal and soft low swooning cry; and he 
			felt that the augury he had sought in the wheeling darting 
			birds and in the pale space of sky above him had come forth 
			from his heart like a bird from a turret quietly and swiftly. </p>
		<p>Symbol of departure or of loneliness? The verses crooned in 
			the ear of his memory composed slowly before his remembering 
			eyes the scene of the hall on the night of the opening of the 
			national theatre. He was alone at the side of the balcony, 
			looking out of jaded eyes at the culture of Dublin in the stalls 
			and at the tawdry scenecloths and human dolls framed by the 
			garish lamps of the stage. A burly policeman sweated behind 
			him and seemed at every moment about to act. The catcalls 
			and hisses and mocking cries ran in rude gusts round the hall 
			from his scattered fellowstudents. </p>
		<p>—A libel on Ireland! </p>
		<p>—Made in Germany! </p>
		<p>—Blasphemy! </p>
		<p>—We never sold our faith! </p>
		<p>—No  Irish woman ever did it! </p>
		<p>—We want no amateur atheists. </p>
		<p>—We want no budding buddhists. </p>
		<p>A sudden swift hiss fell from the windows above him and he 
			knew that the electric lamps had been switched on in the 
			reader's room. He turned into the pillared  hall, now calmly lit, 
			went up the staircase and passed in through the clicking turnstile. </p>
		<p>Cranly was sitting over near the dictionaries. A thick book, 
			opened at the frontispiece, lay before him on the wooden rest. 
			He leaned back in his chair, inclining his ear like that of a 
			confessor to the face of the medical student who was reading 
			to him a problem from the chess page of a journal. Stephen sat 
			down at his right and the priest at the other side of the  table 
			closed his copy of <hi rend="italic">The Tablet</hi> with an angry snap and stood 
			up. </p>
		<p>Cranly gazed after him blandly and vaguely. The medical 
			student went on in a softer voice: </p>
		<p>—Pawn to king's fourth. </p>
		<p>—We had better go, Dixon, said Stephen in warning. He 
			has gone to complain. </p>
		<p>Dixon folded the journal and rose with dignity, saying: </p>
		<p>—Our men retired in good order. </p>
		<p>—With guns and cattle, added Stephen, pointing to the 
			titlepage of Cranly's book on which was printed <hi rend="italic">Diseases of 
			the Ox</hi>. </p>
		<p>As they passed through a lane of the tables Stephen said: </p>
		<p>—Cranly, I want to speak to you. </p>
		<p>Cranly did not answer or turn. He laid his book on the 
			counter and passed out, his wellshod feet sounding flatly on 
			the floor. On the staircase he paused and gazing absently at 
			Dixon repeated: </p>
		<p>—Pawn to king's bloody fourth. </p>
		<p>—Put it that way if you like, Dixon said. </p>
		<p>He had a quiet toneless voice and urbane manners and on a 
			finger of his plump clean hand he displayed at moments a 
			signet ring. </p>
		<p>As they crossed the hall a man of dwarfish stature came 
			towards them. Under the dome of his tiny hat his unshaven 
			face began to smile with pleasure and he was heard to murmur. 
			The eyes were melancholy as those of a monkey. </p>
		<p>—Good evening, captain, said Cranly, halting. </p>
		<p>—Good evening, gentlemen, said the stubblegrown monkeyish 
			face. </p>
		<p>—Warm weather for March, said Cranly. They have the 
			windows open upstairs. </p>
		<p>Dixon smiled and turned his ring. The blackish monkeypuckered 
			face pursed its human mouth with gentle pleasure: 
			and its voice purred: </p>
		<p>—Delightful weather for March. Simply delightful. </p>
		<p>—There are two nice young ladies upstairs, captain, tired of 
			waiting, Dixon said. </p>
		<p>Cranly smiled and said kindly: </p>
		<p>—The captain has only one love: sir Walter Scott. Isn't that 
			so, captain? </p>
		<p>—What are you reading now, captain? Dixon asked. <hi rend="italic">The 
			Bride of Lammermoor?</hi> </p>
		<p>—I love old Scott, the flexible lips said. I think he writes 
			something lovely. There is no writer can touch sir Walter 
			Scott. </p>
		<p>He moved a thin shrunken brown hand gently in the air in 
			time to his praise and his thin quick eyelids beat often over his 
			sad eyes. </p>
		<p>Sadder to Stephen's ear was his speech: a genteel accent, 
			low and moist, marred by errors: and listening to it he wondered 
			was the story true and was the thin blood that flowed in 
			his shrunken frame noble and come of an incestuous  love? </p>
		<p>The park trees were heavy with rain and rain fell still and 
			ever in the lake, lying grey like a shield. A game of swans flew 
			there and the water and the shore beneath were fouled with 
			their greenwhite slime. They embraced softly, impelled by the 
			grey rainy light, the wet silent trees, the shieldlike witnessing 
			lake, the swans. They embraced without joy or passion, his 
			arm about his sister's neck. A grey woollen cloak was 
			wrapped athwart her from her shoulder to her waist: and her 
			fair head was bent in willing shame. He had loose redbrown 
			hair and tender shapely strong freckled hands. Face. There 
			was no face seen. The brother's face was bent upon her fair 
			rainfragrant hair. The hand freckled and strong and shapely 
			and caressing was Davin's hand. </p>
		<p>He frowned angrily upon his thought and on the shrivelled 
			mannikin who had called it forth. His father's gibes at the 
			Bantry gang leaped out of his memory. He held them at a 
			distance and brooded uneasily on his own thought again. Why 
			were they not  Cranly's hands? Had Davin's simplicity and 
			innocence stung him more secretly? </p>
		<p>He walked on across the hall with Dixon, leaving Cranly to 
			take leave elaborately of the dwarf. </p>
		<p>Under the colonnade Temple was standing in the midst of a 
			little group of students. One of them cried: </p>
		<p>—Dixon, come over till you hear. Temple is in grand form. </p>
		<p>Temple turned on him his dark gipsy eyes. </p>
		<p>—You're a hypocrite, O'Keeffe, he said, and Dixon's a 
			smiler. By hell, I think that's a good literary expression. </p>
		<p>He laughed slily, looking in Stephen's face, repeating: </p>
		<p>—By hell, I'm delighted with that name. A smiler. </p>
		<p>A stout student who stood below them on the steps said: </p>
		<p>—Come back to the mistress, Temple. We want to hear 
			about that. </p>
		<p>—He had, faith, Temple said. And he was a married man 
			too. And all the priests used to be dining there. By hell, I think 
			they all had a touch. </p>
		<p>—We shall call it riding a hack to spare the hunter, said 
			Dixon. </p>
		<p>—Tell us, Temple, O'Keeffe said, how many quarts of 
			porter have you in you? </p>
		<p>—All your intellectual soul is in that phrase, O'Keeffe, said 
			Temple with open scorn. </p>
		<p>He moved with a shambling gait round the group and spoke 
			to Stephen. </p>
		<p>—Did you know that the Forsters are the kings of Belgium? 
			he asked. </p>
		<p>Cranly came out through the door of the entrance hall, his 
			hat thrust back on the nape of his neck and picking his teeth 
			with care. </p>
		<p>—And here's the wiseacre, said Temple. Do you know that 
			about the Forsters? </p>
		<p>He paused for an answer. Cranly dislodged a figseed from 
			his teeth on the point of his rude toothpick and gazed at it 
			intently. </p>
		<p>—The Forster  family, Temple said, is descended from Baldwin 
			the First, king of Flanders. He was called the Forester. 
			Forester and Forster are the same name. A descendant of 
			Baldwin the First, captain Francis Forster, settled in Ireland 
			and married the daughter of the last chieftain of Clanbrassil. 
			Then there are the Blake Forsters. That's a different branch. </p>
		<p>—From Baldhead, king of Flanders, Cranly repeated, 
			rooting again deliberately at his gleaming uncovered teeth. </p>
		<p>—Where did you pick up all that history? O'Keeffe asked. </p>
		<p>—I know all the history of your family too, Temple said, 
			turning to Stephen. Do you know what Giraldus Cambrensis 
			says about your family? </p>
		<p>—Is he descended from Baldwin too? asked a tall consumptive 
			student with dark eyes. </p>
		<p>—Baldhead, Cranly repeated, sucking at a crevice in his 
			teeth. </p>
		<p>—<seg xml:lang="lat"><hi rend="italic">Pernobilis et pervetusta familia</hi></seg>, Temple said to Stephen. </p>
		<p>The stout student who stood below them on the steps farted 
			briefly. Dixon turned towards him saying in a soft voice: </p>
		<p>—Did an angel speak? </p>
		<p>Cranly turned also and said vehemently but without anger: </p>
		<p>—Goggins, you're the flamingest dirty devil I ever met, do 
			you know. </p>
		<p>—I had it on my mind to say that, Goggins answered 
			firmly. It did no one any harm, did it? </p>
		<p>—We hope, Dixon said suavely, that it was not of the kind 
			known to science as a <seg xml:lang="lat"><hi rend="italic">paulo post futurum</hi></seg>. </p>
		<p>—Didn't I tell you he was a smiler? said Temple, turning 
			right and left. Didn't I give him that name? </p>
		<p>—You did. We're not deaf, said the tall consumptive. </p>
		<p>Cranly still frowned at the stout student below him. Then, 
			with a snort of disgust, he shoved him violently down the 
			steps. </p>
		<p>—Go away from here, he said rudely. Go away, you 
			stinkpot. And you are a stinkpot. </p>
		<p>Goggins skipped down on to the gravel and at once returned 
			to his place with good humour. Temple turned back to 
			Stephen and asked: </p>
		<p>—Do you believe in the law of heredity? </p>
		<p>—Are you drunk or what are you or what are you trying to 
			say? asked Cranly, facing round on him with an expression of 
			wonder. </p>
		<p>—The most profound sentence ever written, Temple said 
			with enthusiasm, is the sentence at the end of the zoology. 
			Reproduction is the beginning of death. </p>
		<p>He touched Stephen timidly at the elbow and said eagerly: </p>
		<p>—Do you feel how profound that is because you are a 
			poet? </p>
		<p>Cranly pointed his long forefinger. </p>
		<p>—Look at him! he said with scorn to the others. Look at 
			Ireland's hope! </p>
		<p>They laughed at his words and gesture. Temple turned on 
			him bravely, saying: </p>
		<p>—Cranly, you're always sneering at me. I can see that. But 
			I am as good as you any day. Do you know what I think about 
			you now as compared with myself? </p>
		<p>—My dear man, said Cranly urbanely, you are incapable, 
			do you know, absolutely incapable of thinking. </p>
		<p>—But do you know, Temple went on, what I think of you 
			and of myself compared together? </p>
		<p>—Out with it, Temple! the stout student cried from the 
			steps. Get it out in bits! </p>
		<p>Temple turned right and left, making sudden feeble gestures 
			as he spoke. </p>
		<p>—I'm a ballocks, he said, shaking his head in despair. I am. 
			And I know I am. And I admit it that I am. </p>
		<p>Dixon patted him lightly on the shoulder and said mildly: </p>
		<p>—And it does you every credit, Temple. </p>
		<p>—But he, Temple said, pointing to Cranly. He is a ballocks 
			too like me. Only he doesn't know it. And that's the only 
			difference I see. </p>
		<p>A burst of laughter covered his words. But he turned again 
			to Stephen and said with a sudden eagerness: </p>
		<p>—That word is a most interesting word. That's the only 
			English dual number. Did you know? </p>
		<p>—Is it? Stephen said vaguely. </p>
		<p>He was watching Cranly's firmfeatured suffering face, lit up 
			now by a smile of false patience. The gross name had passed 
			over it like foul water poured over an old stone image, patient 
			of injuries: and, as he watched him, he saw him raise his hat in 
			salute and uncover the black hair that stood up stiffly from his 
			forehead like an iron crown. </p>
		<p>She passed out from the porch of the library and bowed 
			across Stephen in reply to Cranly's greeting. He also? Was 
			there not a slight flush on Cranly's cheek? Or had it come 
			forth at Temple's words? The light had waned. He could not 
			see. </p>
		<p>Did that explain his friend's listless silence, his harsh comments, 
			the sudden intrusions of rude speech with which he had 
			shattered so often Stephen's ardent wayward confessions? 
			Stephen had forgiven freely for he had found this rudeness 
			also in himself towards himself. And he remembered an 
			evening when he had dismounted from a borrowed creaking 
			bicycle to pray to God in a wood near Malahide. He had lifted 
			up his arms and spoken in ecstasy to the sombre nave of the 
			trees, knowing that he stood on holy ground and in a holy 
			hour. And when  two constabularymen had come into sight 
			round a bend in the gloomy road he had broken off his prayer 
			to whistle loudly an air from the last pantomime. </p>
		<p>He began to beat the frayed end of his ashplant against the 
			base of a pillar. Had Cranly not heard him? Yet he could wait. 
			The talk about him ceased for a moment: and a soft hiss fell 
			again from a window above. But no other sound was in the air 
			and the swallows whose flight he had followed with idle eyes 
			were sleeping. </p>
		<p>She had passed through the dusk. And therefore the air was 
			silent save for one soft hiss that fell. And therefore the tongues 
			about him had ceased their babble. Darkness  was falling. </p>
		<l><i>Darkness falls from the air.</i> </l>
		<p>A trembling joy, lambent as a faint light, played like a fairy 
			host around him. But why? Her passage through the darkening 
			air or the verse with its black vowels and its opening 
			sound, rich and lutelike? </p>
		<p>He walked away slowly towards the deeper shadows at the 
			end of the colonnade, beating the stone softly with his stick to 
			hide his revery from the students whom he had left: and 
			allowed his mind to summon back to itself the age of Dowland 
			and Byrd and Nash. </p>
		<p>Eyes, opening from the darkness of desire, eyes that 
			dimmed the breaking east. What was their languid grace but 
			the softness of chambering? And what was their shimmer but 
			the shimmer of the scum that mantled the cesspool of the 
			court of a slobbering Stuart. And he tasted in the language of 
			memory ambered wines, dying fallings of sweet airs, the proud 
			pavan: and saw with the eyes of memory kind gentlewomen in 
			Covent Garden wooing from their balconies with sucking 
			mouths and the poxfouled wenches of the taverns and young 
			wives that, gaily yielding to their ravishers, clipped and 
			clipped again. </p>
		<p>The images he had summoned gave him no pleasure. They 
			were secret and enflaming but her image was not entangled by 
			them. That was not the way to think of her. It was not even 
			the way in which he thought of her. Could his mind then not 
			trust itself? Old phrases, sweet only with a disinterred sweetness 
			like the figseeds Cranly rooted out of his gleaming teeth. </p>
		<p>It was not thought nor vision though he knew vaguely that 
			her figure was passing homeward through the city. Vaguely 
			first and then more sharply he smelt her body. A conscious 
			unrest seethed in his blood. Yes, it was her body he smelt: a 
			wild and languid smell: the tepid limbs over which his music 
			had flowed desirously and the secret soft linen upon which her 
			flesh distilled odour and a dew. </p>
		<p>A louse crawled over the nape of his neck and, putting his 
			thumb and forefinger deftly beneath his loose collar, he caught 
			it. He rolled its body, tender yet brittle as a grain of rice, 
			between thumb and finger for an instant before he let it fall 
			from him and wondered would it live or die. There came to his 
			mind a curious phrase from Cornelius a Lapide which said 
			that the lice born of human sweat were not created by God 
			with the other animals on the sixth day. But the tickling of the 
			skin of his neck made his mind raw and red. The life of his 
			body, illclad, illfed, louseeaten, made him close his eyelids in a 
			sudden spasm of despair: and in the darkness he saw the 
			brittle bright bodies of lice falling from the air and turning 
			often as they fell. Yes; and it was not darkness that fell from 
			the air. It was brightness. </p>
		<l><i>Brightness falls from the air.</i> </l>
		<p>He had not even remembered rightly Nash's line. All the 
			images it  had awakened were false. His mind bred vermin. His 
			thoughts were lice born of the sweat of sloth. </p>
		<p>He came back quickly along the colonnade towards the 
			group of students. Well then, let her go and be damned to her. 
			She could love some clean athlete who washed himself every 
			morning to the waist and had black hair on his chest. Let her. </p>
		<p>Cranly had taken another dried fig from the supply in his 
			pocket and was eating it slowly and noisily. Temple sat on the 
			pediment of a pillar, leaning back, his cap pulled down on his 
			sleepy eyes. A squat young man came out of the porch, a 
			leather portfolio tucked under his armpit. He marched towards 
			the group, striking the flags with the heels of his boots 
			and with the ferule of his heavy umbrella. Then, raising the 
			umbrella in salute, he said to all: </p>
		<p>—Good evening, sirs. </p>
		<p>He struck the flags again and tittered while his head trembled 
			with a slight nervous movement. The tall consumptive 
			student and Dixon and O'Keeffe were speaking in Irish and 
			did not answer him. Then, turning to Cranly, he said: </p>
		<p>—Good evening, particularly to you. </p>
		<p>He moved the umbrella in indication and tittered again. 
			Cranly, who was still chewing the fig, answered with loud 
			movements of his jaws. </p>
		<p>—Good? Yes. It is a good evening. </p>
		<p>The squat student looked at him seriously and shook his 
			umbrella gently and reprovingly. </p>
		<p>—I can see, he said, that you are about to make obvious 
			remarks. </p>
		<p>—Um, Cranly answered, holding out what remained of the 
			halfchewed fig and jerking it towards the squat student's 
			mouth in sign that he should eat. </p>
		<p>The squat student did not eat it but, indulging his  special 
			humour, said gravely, still tittering and prodding his phrase 
			with his  umbrella: </p>
		<p>—Do you intend that ... </p>
		<p>He broke off, pointed bluntly to the munched pulp of the fig 
			and said loudly: </p>
		<p>—I allude to that. </p>
		<p>—Um, Cranly said as before. </p>
		<p>—Do you intend that now, the squat student said, as > 
			<i>facto</i> or, let us say, as so to speak? </p>
		<p>Dixon turned aside from his group, saying: </p>
		<p>—Goggins was waiting for you, Glynn. He has gone round 
			to the Adelphi to look for you and Moynihan. What have you 
			there? he asked, tapping the portfolio under Glynn's arm. </p>
		<p>—Examination papers, Glynn answered. I give them 
			monthly examinations to see that they are profiting by my 
			tuition. </p>
		<p>He also tapped the portfolio and coughed gently and smiled. </p>
		<p>—Tuition!  said Cranly rudely. I suppose you mean the 
			barefooted children that are taught by a bloody ape like you. 
			God help them! </p>
		<p>He bit off the rest of the fig and flung away the butt. </p>
		<p>—I suffer little children to come unto me, Glynn said 
			amiably. </p>
		<p>—A bloody ape, Cranly repeated with emphasis, and a 
			blasphemous bloody ape! </p>
		<p>Temple stood up and, pushing past Cranly, addressed 
			Glynn: </p>
		<p>—That phrase you said now, he said, is from the new 
			testament about suffer the children to come to me. </p>
		<p>—Go to sleep again, Temple, said O'Keeffe. </p>
		<p>—Very well, then, Temple continued, still addressing 
			Glynn, and if Jesus suffered the children to come why does the 
			church send them all to hell if they die unbaptised? Why is 
			that? </p>
		<p>—Were you baptised yourself, Temple? the consumptive 
			student asked. </p>
		<p>—But why are they sent to hell if Jesus said they were all to 
			come? Temple said, his eyes searching in Glynn's eyes. </p>
		<p>Glynn coughed and said gently, holding back with difficulty 
			the nervous titter in his voice and moving his umbrella at every 
			word: </p>
		<p>—And, as you remark, if it is thus I ask emphatically 
			whence comes this thusness. </p>
		<p>—Because the church is cruel like all old sinners, Temple 
			said. </p>
		<p>—Are you quite orthodox on that point, Temple? Dixon 
			said suavely. </p>
		<p>—Saint Augustine says that about unbaptised children 
			going to hell, Temple answered, because he was a cruel old 
			sinner too. </p>
		<p>—I bow to you, Dixon said, but I had the impression that 
			limbo existed for such cases. </p>
		<p>—Don't argue with him, Dixon, Cranly said brutally. Don't 
			talk to him or look at him. Lead him home with a sugan the 
			way you'd lead a bleating goat. </p>
		<p>—Limbo! Temple cried. That's a fine invention too. Like 
			hell. </p>
		<p>—But with the unpleasantness left out, Dixon said. </p>
		<p>He turned smiling to the others and said: </p>
		<p>—I think I am voicing the opinions of all present in saying 
			so much. </p>
		<p>—You are, Glynn said in a firm tone. On that point Ireland 
			is united. </p>
		<p>He struck the ferule of his umbrella on the stone floor of the 
			colonnade. </p>
		<p>—Hell, Temple said. I can respect that invention of the 
			grey spouse of Satan. Hell is Roman, like the walls of the 
			Romans, strong and ugly. But what is limbo? </p>
		<p>—Put him back into  the perambulator, Cranly, O'Keeffe 
			called out. </p>
		<p>Cranly made a swift step towards Temple, halted, stamping 
			his foot, crying as if to a fowl: </p>
		<p>—Hoosh! </p>
		<p>Temple moved away nimbly. </p>
		<p>—Do you know what limbo is? he cried. Do you know what 
			we call a notion like that in Roscommon? </p>
		<p>—Hoosh! Blast you! Cranly cried, clapping his hands. </p>
		<p>—Neither my arse nor my elbow! Temple cried out scornfully. 
			And that's what I call limbo. </p>
		<p>—Give us that stick here, Cranly said. </p>
		<p>He snatched the ashplant roughly from Stephen's hand and 
			sprang down the steps: but Temple, hearing him move in 
			pursuit, fled through the dusk like a wild creature, nimble and 
			fleetfooted. Cranly's heavy boots were heard loudly charging 
			across the quadrangle and then returning heavily, foiled and 
			spurning the gravel at each step. </p>
		<p>His step was angry and with an angry abrupt gesture he 
			thrust the stick back into Stephen's hand. Stephen felt that his 
			anger had another cause but, feigning patience, touched his 
			arm slightly and said quietly: </p>
		<p>—Cranly, I told you I wanted to speak to you. Come away. </p>
		<p>Cranly looked at him for a few moments and asked: </p>
		<p>—Now? </p>
		<p>—Yes, now, Stephen said. We can't speak here. Come 
			away. </p>
		<p>They crossed the quadrangle together without speaking. 
			The birdcall from > whistled softly followed them from 
			the steps of the porch. Cranly turned: and Dixon, who had 
			whistled, called out: </p>
		<p>—Where are you fellows off to? What about that  game, 
			Cranly? </p>
		<p>They parleyed in shouts across the still air about a game of 
			billiards to be played in the Adelphi hotel. Stephen walked on 
			alone and out into the quiet of Kildare Street. Opposite Maple's 
			hotel he stood to wait, patient again. The name of the 
			hotel, a colourless polished wood, and its colourless quiet 
			front stung him like a glance of polite disdain. He stared 
			angrily back at the softly lit drawingroom of the hotel in which 
			he imagined the sleek lives of the patricians of Ireland housed 
			in calm. They thought of army commissions and land agents: 
			peasants greeted them along the roads  in the country: they 
			knew the names of certain French dishes and gave orders to 
			jarvies in highpitched provincial voices which pierced through 
			their skintight accents. </p>
		<p>How could he hit their conscience or how cast his shadow 
			over the imaginations of their daughters, before their squires 
			begat upon them, that they might breed a race less ignoble 
			than their own? And under the deepened dusk he felt the 
			thoughts and desires of the race to which he belonged flitting 
			like bats, across the dark country lanes,  under trees by the 
			edges of streams and near the poolmottled bogs. A woman had 
			waited in the doorway as Davin had passed by at night and, 
			offering him a cup of milk, had all but wooed him to her bed; 
			for Davin had the mild eyes of one who could be secret. But 
			him no woman's eyes had wooed. </p>
		<p>His arm was taken in a strong grip and Cranly's voice said: </p>
		<p>—Let us eke go. </p>
		<p>They walked southward in silence. Then Cranly said: </p>
		<p>—That blithering idiot Temple! I swear to Moses, do you 
			know, that I'll be the death of that fellow one time. </p>
		<p>But his voice was no longer angry and Stephen wondered 
			was he thinking of her greeting to him under the porch. </p>
		<p>They turned to the left and walked on as before. When they 
			had gone on so for some time Stephen said: </p>
		<p>—Cranly, I had an unpleasant quarrel this evening. </p>
		<p>—With your people? Cranly asked. </p>
		<p>—With my mother. </p>
		<p>—About religion? </p>
		<p>—Yes, Stephen answered. </p>
		<p>After a pause Cranly asked: </p>
		<p>—What age is your mother? </p>
		<p>—Not old, Stephen said. She wishes me to make my easter 
			duty. </p>
		<p>—And will you? </p>
		<p>—I will not, Stephen said. </p>
		<p>—Why not? Cranly said. </p>
		<p>—I will not serve, answered Stephen. </p>
		<p>—That remark was made before, Cranly said calmly. </p>
		<p>—It is made behind now, said Stephen hotly. </p>
		<p>Cranly pressed Stephen's arm, saying: </p>
		<p>—Go easy, my dear man. You're an excitable bloody man, 
			do you know. </p>
		<p>He laughed nervously as he spoke and, looking up into 
			Stephen's face with moved and friendly eyes, said: </p>
		<p>—Do you know that you are an excitable man? </p>
		<p>—I daresay I am, said Stephen, laughing also. </p>
		<p>Their minds, lately estranged, seemed suddenly to have 
			been drawn closer, one to the other. </p>
		<p>—Do you believe in the eucharist? Cranly asked. </p>
		<p>—I do not, Stephen said. </p>
		<p>—Do you disbelieve then? </p>
		<p>—I neither believe in it nor disbelieve in it, Stephen answered. </p>
		<p>—Many persons have doubts, even religious persons, yet 
			they overcome them or put them aside, Cranly said. Are your 
			doubts on that point too strong? </p>
		<p>—I do not wish to overcome them, Stephen answered. </p>
		<p>Cranly, embarrassed for a moment, took another fig from 
			his pocket and was about to eat it when Stephen said: </p>
		<p>—Don't, please. You cannot discuss this question with your 
			mouth full of chewed  fig. </p>
		<p>Cranly examined the fig by the light of a lamp under which 
			he halted. Then he smelt it with both nostrils, bit a tiny piece, 
			spat it out and threw the fig rudely into the gutter. Addressing 
			it as it lay, he said: </p>
		<p>—Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire! </p>
		<p>Taking Stephen's arm, he went on again and said: </p>
		<p>—Do you not fear that those words may be spoken to you 
			on the day of judgment? </p>
		<p>—What is offered me on the other hand? Stephen asked. 
			An eternity of bliss in the company of the dean of studies? </p>
		<p>—Remember, Cranly said, that he would be glorified. </p>
		<p>—Ay, Stephen said somewhat bitterly, bright, agile, impassible 
			and, above all, subtle. </p>
		<p>—It is a curious thing, do you know, Cranly said dispassionately, 
			how your mind is supersaturated with the religion in 
			which you say you disbelieve. Did you believe in it when you 
			were at school? I bet you did. </p>
		<p>—I did, Stephen answered. </p>
		<p>—And were you happier then? Cranly asked softly. Happier 
			than you are now, for instance? </p>
		<p>—Often happy, Stephen said, and often unhappy. I was 
			someone else then. </p>
		<p>—How someone else? What do you mean by that  statement? </p>
		<p>—I mean, said Stephen, that I was not myself as I am now, 
			as I had to become. </p>
		<p>—Not as you are now, not as you had to become, Cranly 
			repeated. Let me ask you a question. Do you love your 
			mother? </p>
		<p>Stephen shook his head slowly. </p>
		<p>—I don't know what your words mean, he said simply. </p>
		<p>—Have you never loved anyone? Cranly asked. </p>
		<p>—Do you mean women? </p>
		<p>—I am not speaking of that, Cranly said in a colder tone. I 
			ask you if you ever felt love towards anyone or anything. </p>
		<p>Stephen walked on beside his friend, staring gloomily at the 
			footpath. </p>
		<p>—I tried to love God, he said at length. It seems now I 
			failed. It is very difficult. I tried to unite my will with the will 
			of God instant by instant. In that I did not always fail. I could 
			perhaps do that still ... </p>
		<p>Cranly cut him short by asking: </p>
		<p>—Has your mother had a happy life? </p>
		<p>—How do I know? Stephen said. </p>
		<p>—How many children had she? </p>
		<p>—Nine or ten, Stephen answered. Some died. </p>
		<p>—Was your father .... Cranly interrupted himself for an 
			instant: and then said: I don't want to pry  into your family 
			affairs. But was your father what is called  well-to-do? I mean 
			when you were growing up? </p>
		<p>—Yes, Stephen said. </p>
		<p>—What was he? Cranly asked after a pause. </p>
		<p>Stephen began to enumerate glibly his father's attributes. </p>
		<p>—A medical student, an oarsman, a tenor, an amateur 
			actor, a shouting politician, a small landlord, a small investor, 
			a drinker, a good fellow, a storyteller, somebody's secretary, 
			something in a distillery, a taxgatherer, a bankrupt and at 
			present a praiser of his own past. </p>
		<p>Cranly laughed, tightening  his grip on Stephen's arm, and 
			said: </p>
		<p>—The distillery is damn good. </p>
		<p>—Is there anything else you want to know? Stephen asked. </p>
		<p>—Are you in good circumstances at present? </p>
		<p>—Do I look it? Stephen asked bluntly. </p>
		<p>—So then, Cranly went on musingly, you were born in the 
			lap of luxury. </p>
		<p>He used the phrase broadly and loudly as he often used 
			technical expressions as if he wished his hearer to understand 
			that they were used by him without conviction. </p>
		<p>—Your mother must have gone through a good deal of 
			suffering, he said then. Would you not try to save her from 
			suffering more even if ... or would you? </p>
		<p>—If I could, Stephen said. That would cost me very little. </p>
		<p>—Then do so, Cranly said. Do as she wishes you to do. 
			What is it for you? You disbelieve in it. It is a form: nothing 
			else. And you will set her mind at rest. </p>
		<p>He ceased and, as Stephen did not reply, remained silent. 
			Then, as if giving utterance to the process of his own thought, 
			he said: </p>
		<p>—Whatever else is unsure in this stinking dunghill of a 
			world a mother's love is not. Your mother brings you into the 
			world, carries you first in her body. What do we know about 
			what she feels? But whatever she feels, it, at least, must be 
			real. It must be. What are our ideas or ambitions? Play. Ideas! 
			Why, that bloody bleating goat Temple has ideas. MacCann 
			has ideas too. Every jackass going the  roads thinks he has 
			ideas. </p>
		<p>Stephen, who had been listening to the unspoken speech 
			behind the words, said with  assumed carelessness: </p>
		<p>—Pascal, if I remember rightly, would not suffer his mother 
			to kiss him as he feared the contact of her sex. </p>
		<p>—Pascal was a pig, said Cranly. </p>
		<p>—Aloysius Gonzaga, I think, was of the same mind, Stephen 
			said. </p>
		<p>—And he was another pig then, said Cranly. </p>
		<p>—The church calls him a saint, Stephen objected. </p>
		<p>—I don't care a flaming damn what anyone calls him, 
			Cranly said rudely and flatly. I call him a pig. </p>
		<p>Stephen, preparing the words neatly in his mind, continued: </p>
		<p>—Jesus, too, seems to have treated his mother with scant 
			courtesy in public but Suarez, a jesuit theologian and Spanish 
			gentleman, has apologised for him. </p>
		<p>—Did the idea ever occur to you, Cranly asked, that Jesus 
			was not what he pretended to be? </p>
		<p>—The first person to whom that idea occurred,  Stephen 
			answered, was Jesus himself. </p>
		<p>—I mean, Cranly said,  hardening in his speech, did the 
			idea ever occur to you that he was himself a conscious hypocrite, 
			what he called the jews of his time, a whited sepulchre? 
			Or, to put it more plainly, that he was a blackguard? </p>
		<p>—That idea never occurred  to me, Stephen answered. But I 
			am curious to know are you trying to make a convert of me or 
			a pervert of yourself? </p>
		<p>He turned towards his friend's face and saw there a raw 
			smile which some force of will strove to make finely 
			significant. </p>
		<p>Cranly asked suddenly in a plain sensible tone: </p>
		<p>—Tell me the truth. Were you at all shocked by what I 
			said? </p>
		<p>—Somewhat, Stephen said. </p>
		<p>—And why were you shocked, Cranly pressed on in the 
			same tone, if you feel sure that our religion is false and that 
			Jesus was not the son of God? </p>
		<p>—I am not at all sure of it, Stephen said. He is more like a 
			son of God than a son of Mary. </p>
		<p>—And is that why you will not communicate, Cranly asked, 
			because you are not sure of that too, because you feel that the 
			host too may be the body and blood of the son of God and 
			not a wafer of bread? And because you fear that it may be? </p>
		<p>—Yes, Stephen said quietly. I feel that and I also fear it. </p>
		<p>—I see, Cranly said. </p>
		<p>Stephen, struck by his tone of closure, reopened the discussion 
			at once by saying: </p>
		<p>—I fear many things: dogs, horses, firearms, the sea, 
			thunderstorms, machinery, the country roads at night. </p>
		<p>—But why do you fear a bit of bread? </p>
		<p>—I imagine, Stephen said, that there is a malevolent  reality 
			behind those things I say I fear. </p>
		<p>—Do you fear then, Cranly asked, that the God of the 
			Roman catholics would strike you dead and damn you if you 
			made a sacrilegious communion? </p>
		<p>—The God of the Roman catholics could do that now, 
			Stephen said. I fear more than that the chemical action which 
			would be set up in my soul by a false homage to a symbol 
			behind which are massed twenty centuries of authority and 
			veneration. </p>
		<p>—Would you, Cranly asked, in extreme danger commit 
			that particular sacrilege? For instance, if you lived in the penal 
			days? </p>
		<p>—I cannot answer for the past, Stephen replied. Possibly 
			not. </p>
		<p>—Then, said Cranly, you do not intend to become a protestant? </p>
		<p>—I said that I had lost the faith, Stephen answered, but not 
			that I had lost selfrespect. What kind of liberation would that 
			be to forsake an absurdity which is logical and coherent and to 
			embrace one which is illogical and incoherent? </p>
		<p>They had walked on towards the township of Pembroke 
			and now, as they went on slowly along the avenues, the trees 
			and the scattered lights in the villas soothed their minds. The 
			air of wealth and repose diffused about them seemed to comfort 
			their neediness. Behind a hedge of laurel a light glimmered 
			in the window of a kitchen and the voice of a servant 
			was heard singing as she sharpened knives. She sang, in short 
			broken bars, >. </p>
		<p>Cranly stopped to listen, saying: </p>
		<p>—<i>Mulier cantat.</i> </p>
		<p>The soft beauty of the Latin word touched with an enchanting 
			touch the  dark of the evening, with a touch fainter and 
			more persuading than the touch of music or of a woman's 
			hand. The strife of their minds was quelled. The figure of 
			woman as she appears in the liturgy of the church passed 
			silently through the darkness: a whiterobed figure, small and 
			slender as a boy and with a falling girdle. Her voice, frail and 
			high as a boy's, was heard intoning from a distant choir the 
			first words of a woman which pierce the gloom and clamour of 
			the first chanting of the passion: </p>
		<p>—<i>Et tu cum Jesu Galil#.^ao eras.</i> </p>
		<p>And all  hearts were touched and turned to her voice, shining 
			like a young star, shining clearer as the voice intoned the 
			proparoxyton and more faintly as the cadence died. </p>
		<p>The singing ceased. They went on together, Cranly repeating 
			in strongly stressed rhythm the end of the refrain: </p>
		<lg>
			<l>And when we are married, </l>
			<l>O, how happy we'll be </l>
			<l>For I love sweet Rosie O'Grady </l>
			<l>And Rosie O'Grady loves me. </l>
		</lg>
		<p>—There's  real poetry for you, he said. There's real love. </p>
		<p>He glanced sideways at Stephen with a strange smile and 
			said: </p>
		<p>—Do you consider that poetry? Or do you know what the 
			words mean? </p>
		<p>—I want to see Rosie first, said Stephen. </p>
		<p>—She's easy to find, Cranly said. </p>
		<p>His hat had come down on his forehead. He shoved it back: 
			and in the shadow of the trees Stephen saw his pale face, 
			framed by the dark, and his large dark eyes. Yes. His face was 
			handsome: and his body was strong and hard. He had spoken 
			of a mother's love. He felt then the sufferings of women, the 
			weaknesses of their bodies and souls: and would shield them 
			with a strong  and resolute arm and bow his mind to them. </p>
		<p>Away then: it is time to go. A voice spoke softly to Stephen's 
			lonely heart, bidding him go and telling him that his 
			friendship was coming to an end. Yes; he would go. He could 
			not strive against another. He knew his part. </p>
		<p>—Probably I shall go away, he said. </p>
		<p>—Where? Cranly asked. </p>
		<p>—Where I can, Stephen said. </p>
		<p>—Yes, Cranly said. It might be difficult for you to live here 
			now. But is it that that makes you go? </p>
		<p>—I have to go, Stephen answered. </p>
		<p>—Because, Cranly continued, you need not look upon 
			yourself as driven away if you do not wish to go or as a heretic 
			or an outlaw. There are many good believers who think as you 
			do. Would that surprise you? The church is not the stone 
			building nor even the clergy and their dogmas. It is the whole 
			mass of those born into it. I don't know what you wish to do 
			in life. Is it what you told me the night we were standing 
			outside Harcourt Street station? </p>
		<p>—Yes, Stephen said, smiling in spite of himself at Cranly's 
			way of remembering thoughts in connection with places. The 
			night you spent half an hour wrangling with Doherty about the 
			shortest way from Sallygap to Larras. </p>
		<p>—Pothead! Cranly said with calm contempt. What does he 
			know about the way from Sallygap to Larras? Or what does 
			he know about anything for that matter? And the big slobbering 
			washingpot head of him! </p>
		<p>He broke out into a loud long laugh. </p>
		<p>—Well? Stephen said. Do you remember the rest? </p>
		<p>—What you said, is it? Cranly asked. Yes, I remember it. 
			To discover the mode of life or of art whereby your spirit 
			could express itself in unfettered freedom. </p>
		<p>Stephen raised his hat in acknowledgment. </p>
		<p>—Freedom! Cranly repeated. But you are not free enough 
			yet to commit a sacrilege. Tell me, would you rob? </p>
		<p>—I would beg first, Stephen said. </p>
		<p>—And if you got  nothing, would you rob? </p>
		<p>—You wish me to say, Stephen answered, that the rights of 
			property are provisional and that in certain circumstances it is 
			not unlawful to rob. Everyone would act in that belief. So I 
			will not make you that answer. Apply to the jesuit theologian 
			Juan Mariana de Talavera who will also explain to you in 
			what circumstances you may lawfully kill your king and 
			whether you had better hand him his poison in a goblet or 
			smear it for him upon his robe or his saddlebow. Ask me 
			rather would I suffer others to rob me or, if they did, would I 
			call down upon them what I believe is called the chastisement 
			of the secular arm? </p>
		<p>—And would you? </p>
		<p>—I think, Stephen said, it would pain me as much to do so 
			as to be robbed. </p>
		<p>—I see, Cranly said. </p>
		<p>He produced his match and began to clean the crevice 
			between two teeth. Then he said carelessly: </p>
		<p>—Tell me, for example, would you deflower a virgin? </p>
		<p>—Excuse me, Stephen said politely, is that not the ambition 
			of most young gentlemen? </p>
		<p>—What then is your point of view? Cranly asked. </p>
		<p>His last phrase, soursmelling as the smoke of charcoal and 
			disheartening, excited Stephen's brain, over which its fumes 
			seemed to brood. </p>
		<p>—Look here, Cranly, he said. You have asked me what I 
			would do and what I would not do. I will tell you what I will do 
			and what I will not do. I will not serve that in which I no 
			longer believe whether it call itself my home, my fatherland or 
			my church: and I will try to express myself in some mode of 
			life or art as freely as I can and as wholly as I can, using for 
			my defence the only arms I allow myself to use - silence, exile, 
			and cunning. </p>
		<p>Cranly seized his arm and steered him round so as to head 
			back towards Leeson Park. He laughed almost slily and pressed 
			Stephen's arm with an elder's affection. </p>
		<p>—Cunning indeed! he said. Is it you? You poor poet, you! </p>
		<p>—And you made me confess to you, Stephen said, thrilled 
			by his touch, as I have confessed to you so  many other things, 
			have I not? </p>
		<p>—Yes, my child, Cranly said, still gaily. </p>
		<p>—You made me confess the fears that I have. But I will tell 
			you also what I do not fear. I do not fear to be alone or to be 
			spurned for another or to leave whatever I have to leave. And 
			I am not afraid to make a mistake, even  a great  mistake, a 
			lifelong mistake and perhaps as long as eternity too. </p>
		<p>Cranly, now grave again, slowed his pace and said: </p>
		<p>—Alone, quite alone. You have no fear of that. And you 
			know what that word means? Not only to be separate from all 
			others but to have not even one friend. </p>
		<p>—I will take the risk, said Stephen. </p>
		<p>—And not to have any one person, Cranly said, who would 
			be more than a friend, more even than the noblest and truest 
			friend a man ever had. </p>
		<p>His words seemed to have struck some deep chord in his 
			own nature. Had he spoken of himself, of himself as he was or 
			wished  to be? Stephen watched his face for some moments in 
			silence. A cold sadness was there. He had spoken of himself, 
			of his own loneliness which he feared. </p>
		<p>—Of whom are you speaking? Stephen asked at length. </p>
		<p>Cranly did not answer. </p>

		<p>20 > Long talk with Cranly on the subject of my 
			revolt. He had his grand manner on. I supple and suave. 
			Attacked me on the score of love for one's mother. Tried to 
			imagine his mother: cannot. Told me once, in a moment of 
			thoughtlessness, his father was sixtyone when he was born. 
			Can see him. Strong farmer type. Pepper and salt suit. Square 
			feet. Unkempt grizzled beard. Probably attends coursing 
			matches. Pays his dues regularly but not plentifully to Father 
			Dwyer of Larras. Sometimes talks to girls after nightfall. But 
			his mother? Very young or very old? Hardly the first. If so, 
			Cranly would not have spoken as he did. Old then. Probably, 
			and neglected. Hence Cranly's despair of soul: the child of 
			exhausted loins. </p>
		<p>21 > Thought this in bed last night but was 
			too lazy and free to add it. Free, yes. The exhausted loins are 
			those of Elisabeth and Zachary. Then he is the precursor. 
			Item: he eats chiefly belly bacon and dried figs. Read locusts 
			and wild honey. Also, when thinking of him, saw always a 
			stern severed head or deathmask as if outlined on a grey 
			curtain or veronica. Decollation they call it in the fold. Puzzled 
			for the moment by saint John at the Latin gate. What do I 
			see? A decollated precursor trying to pick the lock. </p>
		<p>21 > Free. Soulfree and fancyfree. Let the 
			dead bury the dead. Ay. And let the dead marry the dead. </p>
		<p>22 > In company with Lynch followed a sizable 
			hospital nurse. Lynch's idea. Dislike it. Two lean hungry 
			greyhounds walking after a heifer. </p>
		<p>23 > Have not seen her since that night. Unwell? Sits 
			at the fire perhaps with mamma's shawl on her shoulders. But 
			not peevish. A nice bowl of gruel? Won't you now? </p>
		<p>24 > Began with a discussion with my mother. Subject: 
			B. V. M. Handicapped by my sex and youth. To escape 
			held up relations between Jesus and Papa against those between 
			Mary and her son. Said religion was not a lying-in 
			hospital. Mother indulgent. Said I have a queer mind and have 
			read too much. Not true. Have read little and understood less. 
			Then she said I would come back to faith because I had a 
			restless mind. This means to leave church by backdoor of sin 
			and reenter through the skylight of repentance. Cannot repent. 
			Told her so and asked for sixpence. Got threepence. </p>
		<p>Then went to college. Other wrangle with little roundhead 
			rogue'seye Ghezzi. This time about Bruno the Nolan. Began in 
			Italian and ended in pidgin English. He said Bruno was a 
			terrible heretic. I said he was terribly burned. He agreed to 
			this with some sorrow. Then gave me recipe for what he calls 
			<i>risotto alla bergamasca</i>. When he pronounces a  soft > he 
			protrudes his full carnal lips as if he kissed the vowel. Has he? 
			And could he repent? Yes, he could: and cry two round 
			rogue's tears, one from each eye. </p>
		<p>Crossing Stephen's, that is, my green, remembered that his 
			countrymen and not mine had invented what Cranly the other 
			night called our religion. A quartet of them, soldiers  of the 
			ninetyseventh infantry regiment, sat at the foot of the cross 
			and tossed up dice for the overcoat of the crucified. </p>

			promise of close embraces and the black arms of tall ships that

			what it feels. Amen. So be it. Welcome, O life! I go to encounter 
			for the millionth time the reality of experience and to forge 
			in the smithy of my soul the uncreated conscience of my race. </p>
		<p>27 > Old father, old artificer, stand me now and ever 
			in good stead. </p>
