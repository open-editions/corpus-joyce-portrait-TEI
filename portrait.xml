            <p> The wide playgrounds were swarming with boys. All were <lb n="42" />
             shouting and the prefects urged them on with strong cries. The <lb n="43" />
             evening air was pale and chilly and after every charge and thud <lb n="44" />
             of the footballers the greasy leather orb flew like a heavy bird <lb n="45" />
             through the grey light. He kept on the fringe of his line, out of <lb n="46" />
             sight of his prefect, out of the reach of the rude feet, feigning to <lb n="47" />
             run now and then. He felt his body small and weak amid the <lb n="48" />
             throng of players and his eyes were weak and watery. <persName> Rody <lb n="49" />
             Kickham</persName> was not like that: he would be captain of the third <lb n="50" />
             line all the fellows said.<lb n="51" /> </p>
            <p> <persName> Rody Kickham</persName> was a decent fellow but <persName> Nasty Roche</persName> was a <lb n="52" />
             stink. <persName> Rody Kickham</persName> had greaves in his number and a hamper <lb n="53" />
             in the refectory. <persName> Nasty Roche</persName> had big hands. He called the <lb n="54" />
             Friday pudding dog-in-the-blanket. And one day he had asked:<lb n="55" /> </p>
            <p> <said who="Nasty Roche">&#8213;What is your name? <lb n="56" /></said> </p>
            <p> Stephen had answered:<lb n="57" /> </p>
            <p> <said who="Stephen">&#8213; <persName> Stephen Dedalus</persName>. <lb n="58" /></said> </p>
            <p> Then <persName> Nasty Roche</persName> had said:<lb n="59" /> </p>
            <p> <said who="Nasty Roche">&#8213;What kind of a name is that? <lb n="60" /></said> </p>
            <p> And when <persName> Stephen</persName> had not been able to answer <persName> Nasty <lb n="61" />
             Roche</persName> had asked:<lb n="62" /> </p>
            <p> <said who="Nasty Roche">&#8213;What is your father? <lb n="63" /></said> </p>
            <p> <persName> Stephen</persName> had answered:<lb n="64" /> </p>
            <p> <said who="Stephen">&#8213;A gentleman. <lb n="65" /></said> </p>
            <p> Then <persName> Nasty Roche</persName> had asked:<lb n="66" /> </p>
            <p> <said who="Nasty Roche">&#8213;Is he a magistrate? <lb n="67" /></said> </p>
            <p> He crept about from point to point on the fringe of his line, <lb n="68" />
             making little runs now and then. But his hands were bluish <lb n="69" />
             with cold. He kept his hands in the sidepockets of his belted <lb n="70" />
             grey suit. That was a belt round his jacket. And belt was also to <lb n="71" />
             give a fellow a belt. One day a fellow had said to <persName> Cantwell</persName>:<lb n="72" /> </p>
            <p> <said who="a fellow">&#8213;I'd give you such a belt in a second. <lb n="73" /></said> </p>
            <p> <persName> Cantwell</persName> had answered:<lb n="74" /> </p>
            <p> <said who="Cantwell">&#8213;Go and fight your match. Give <persName> Cecil Thunder</persName> a belt. I'd like <lb n="75" />
             to see you. He'd give you a toe in the rump for yourself. <lb n="76" /></said> </p>
            <p> That was not a nice expression. His mother had told him <lb n="77" />
             not to speak with the rough boys in the college. Nice mother! <lb n="78" />
             The first day in the hall of the castle when she had said good- <lb n="79" />
             bye she had put up her veil double to her nose to kiss him: and <lb n="80" />
             her nose and eyes were red. But he had pretended not to see <lb n="81" />
             that she was going to cry. She was a nice mother but she was <lb n="82" />
             not so nice when she cried. And his father had given him two <lb n="83" />
             <seg type="neologism"> fiveshilling </seg> pieces for pocket money. And his father had told <lb n="84" />
             him if he wanted anything to write home to him and, whatever <lb n="85" />
             he did, never to peach on a fellow. Then at the door of the <lb n="86" />
             castle the rector had shaken hands with his father and mother, <lb n="87" />
             his soutane fluttering in the breeze, and the car had driven off <lb n="88" />
             with his father and mother on it. They had cried to him from <lb n="89" />
             the car, waving their hands:<lb n="90" /> </p>
            <said who="Mary Dedalus, Simon Dedalus">
              <p>&#8213;Goodbye, <persName> Stephen</persName>, goodbye!<lb n="91" /> </p>
              <p>&#8213;Goodbye, <persName> Stephen</persName>, goodbye!<lb n="92" /> </p>
            </said>
            <p> He was caught in the whirl of a scrimmage and, fearful of <lb n="93" />
             the flashing eyes and muddy boots, bent down to look through <lb n="94" />
             the legs. The fellows were struggling and groaning and their <lb n="95" />
             legs were rubbing and kicking and stamping. Then <persName> Jack <lb n="96" />
             Lawton</persName>'s yellow boots dodged out the ball and all the other <lb n="97" />
             boots and legs ran after. He ran after them a little way and then <lb n="98" />
             stopped. It was useless to run on. Soon they would be going <lb n="99" />
             home for the holidays. After supper in the <seg type="neologism"> studyhall </seg> he would <lb n="100" />
             change the number pasted up inside his desk from <seg type="neologism"> seventyseven </seg> <lb n="101" />
             to <seg type="neologism"> seventysix </seg>.<lb n="102" /> </p>
            <p> It would be better to be in the <seg type="neologism"> studyhall </seg> than out there in the <lb n="103" />
             cold. The sky was pale and cold but there were lights in the <lb n="104" />
             castle. He wondered from which window <persName> Hamilton Rowan</persName> <lb n="105" />
             had thrown his hat on the haha and had there been flowerbeds <lb n="106" />
             at that time under the windows. One day when he had been <lb n="107" />
             called to the castle the butler had shown him the marks of the <lb n="108" />
             soldiers' slugs in the wood of the door and had given him a <lb n="109" />
             piece of shortbread that the community ate. It was nice and <lb n="110" />
             warm to see the lights in the castle. It was like something in a <lb n="111" />
             book. Perhaps <place> <location> <geo> 52.640379 -1.132563 </geo> </location> <placeName> Leicester Abbey </placeName> </place> was like that. And there were <lb n="112" />
             nice sentences in <persName> Doctor Cornwell</persName>'s Spelling Book. They were <lb n="113" />
             like poetry but they were only sentences to learn the spelling <lb n="114" />
             from.<lb n="115" /> </p>
            <lg>
               <l> <emph> <persName> Wolsey</persName> died in <place> <location> <geo> 52.640379 -1.132563 </geo> </location> <placeName> Leicester Abbey </placeName> </place> </emph> </l> <lb n="116" />
               <l> <emph> Where the abbots buried him. </emph> </l> <lb n="117" />
               <l> <emph> Canker is a disease of plants, </emph> </l> <lb n="118" />
               <l> <emph> Cancer one of animals. </emph> </l> <lb n="119" />
            </lg>
            <p> It would be nice to lie on the hearthrug before the fire, <lb n="120" />
             leaning his head upon his hands, and think on those sentences. <lb n="121" />
             He shivered as if he had cold slimy water next his skin. That <lb n="122" />
             was mean of <persName> Wells</persName> to shoulder him into the square ditch be- <lb n="123" />
             cause he would not swop his little <seg type="neologism"> snuffbox </seg> for <persName> Wells </persName>'s sea- <lb n="124" />
             soned hacking chestnut, the conqueror of forty. How cold and <lb n="125" />
             slimy the water had been! A fellow had once seen a big rat <lb n="126" />
             jump plop into the scum. He shivered and longed to cry. It <lb n="127" />
             would be so nice to be at home. Mother was sitting at the fire <lb n="128" />
             with <persName> Dante </persName> waiting for <persName> Brigid </persName> to bring in the tea. She had her <lb n="129" />
             feet on the fender and her jewelly slippers were so hot and they <lb n="130" />
             had such a lovely warm smell! <persName> Dante </persName> knew a lot of things. She <lb n="131" />
             had taught him where the <place> <location> <geo> -18.615949 41.280858 </geo> </location> <placeName> Mozambique Channel </placeName> </place> was and what <lb n="132" />
             was <place> <location> <geo> 38.627003 -90.199404 </geo> </location> <placeName> the longest river in America </placeName> </place> and what was the name of the <lb n="133" />
             highest mountain in the moon. <persName> Father Arnall </persName> knew more than <lb n="134" />
             <persName> Dante </persName> because he was a priest but both his father and <persName> uncle <lb n="135" />
             Charles </persName> said that <persName> Dante </persName> was a clever woman and a <seg type="neologism"> wellread </seg> <lb n="136" />
             woman. And when <persName> Dante </persName> made that noise after dinner and <lb n="137" />
             then put up her hand to her mouth: that was heartburn.<lb n="138" /> </p>
            <p> A voice cried far out on the playground:<lb n="139" /> </p>
            <p> <said who="a voice">&#8213;All in! <lb n="140" /></said> </p>
            <p> Then other voices cried from the lower and third lines:<lb n="141" /> </p>
            <p> <said who="other voices from the lower and third lines">&#8213;All in! All in! <lb n="142" /> </said> </p>
            <p> The players closed around, flushed and muddy, and he went <lb n="143" />
             among them, glad to go in. <persName> Rody Kickham </persName> held the ball by its <lb n="144" />
             greasy lace. A fellow asked him to give it one last: but he <lb n="145" />
             walked on without even answering the fellow. <persName> Simon Moonan </persName> <lb n="146" />
             told him not to because the prefect was looking. The fellow <lb n="147" />
             turned to <persName> Simon Moonan </persName> and said:<lb n="148" /> </p>
            <p> <said who="a fellow">&#8213;We all know why you speak. You are <persName> McGlade </persName>'s suck. <lb n="149" /></said> </p>
            <p> Suck was a queer word. The fellow called <persName> Simon Moonan </persName> <lb n="150" />
             that name because <persName> Simon Moonan </persName> used to tie the prefect's false <lb n="151" />
             sleeves behind his back and the prefect used to let on to be <lb n="152" />
             angry. But the sound was ugly. Once he had washed his hands <lb n="153" />
             in the lavatory of the <place> <location> <geo> 53.342872 -6.260651 </geo> </location> <placeName> Wicklow Hotel </placeName> </place> and his father pulled the <lb n="154" />
             stopper up by the chain after and the dirty water went down <lb n="155" />
             through the hole in the basin. And when it had all gone down <lb n="156" />
             slowly the hole in the basin had made a sound like that: suck. <lb n="157" />
             Only louder.<lb n="158" /> </p>
            <p> To remember that and the white look of the lavatory made <lb n="159" />
             him feel cold and then hot. There were two cocks that you <lb n="160" />
             turned and water came out: cold and hot. He felt cold and then <lb n="161" />
             a little hot: and he could see the names printed on the cocks. <lb n="162" />
             That was a very queer thing.<lb n="163" /> </p>
            <p> And the air in the corridor chilled him too. It was queer and <lb n="164" />
             wettish. But soon the gas would be lit and in burning it made a <lb n="165" />
             light noise like a little song. Always the same: and when the <lb n="166" />
             fellows stopped talking in the playroom you could hear it.<lb n="167" /> </p>
            <p> It was the hour for sums. <persName> Father Arnall </persName> wrote a hard sum on <lb n="168" />
             the board and then said:<lb n="169" /> </p>
            <p> <said who="Father Arnall">&#8213;Now then, who will win? Go ahead, York! Go ahead, Lan- <lb n="170" />
             caster! <lb n="171" /></said> </p>
            <p> <persName> Stephen </persName> tried his best but the sum was too hard and he felt <lb n="172" />
             confused. The little silk badge with the white rose on it that <lb n="173" />
             was pinned on the breast of his jacket began to flutter. He was <lb n="174" />
             no good at sums but he tried his best so that York might not <lb n="175" />
             lose. <persName> Father Arnall </persName>'s face looked very black but he was not in a <lb n="176" />
             wax: he was laughing. Then <persName> Jack Lawton </persName> cracked his fingers <lb n="177" />
             and <persName> Father Arnall </persName> looked at his copybook and said:<lb n="178" /> </p>
            <p> <said who="Father Arnall">&#8213;Right. Bravo Lancaster! The red rose wins. Come on now, <lb n="179" />
             York! Forge ahead! <lb n="180" /></said> </p>
            <p> <persName> Jack Lawton </persName> looked over from his side. The little silk badge <lb n="181" />
             with the red rose on it looked very rich because he had a blue <lb n="182" />
             sailor top on. <persName> Stephen </persName> felt his own face red too, thinking of all <lb n="183" />
             the bets about who would get first place in elements, <persName> Jack <lb n="184" />
             Lawton </persName> or he. Some weeks <persName> Jack Lawton </persName> got the card for first <lb n="185" />
             and some weeks he got the card for first. His white silk badge <lb n="186" />
             fluttered and fluttered as he worked at the next sum and heard <lb n="187" />
             <persName> Father Arnall </persName>'s voice. Then all his eagerness passed away and <lb n="188" />
             he felt his face quite cool. He thought his face must be white <lb n="189" />
             because it felt so cool. He could not get out the answer for the <lb n="190" />
             sum but it did not matter. White roses and red roses: those <lb n="191" />
             were beautiful colours to think of. And the cards for first place <lb n="192" />
             and second place and third place were beautiful colours too: <lb n="193" />
             pink and cream and lavender. Lavender and cream and pink <lb n="194" />
             roses were beautiful to think of. Perhaps a wild rose might be <lb n="195" />
             like those colours: and he remembered the song about the wild <lb n="196" />
             rose blossoms on the little green place. But you could not have <lb n="197" />
             a green rose. But perhaps somewhere in the world you could.<lb n="198" /> </p>
            <p> The bell rang and then the classes began to file out of the <lb n="199" />
             rooms and along the corridors towards the refectory. He sat <lb n="200" />
             looking at the two prints of butter on his plate but could not <lb n="201" />
             eat the damp bread. The tablecloth was damp and limp. But he <lb n="202" />
             drank off the hot weak tea which the clumsy scullion, girt with <lb n="203" />
             a white apron, poured into his cup. He wondered whether the <lb n="204" />
             scullion's apron was damp too or whether all white things were <lb n="205" />
             cold and damp. <persName> Nasty Roche </persName> and <persName> Saurin </persName> drank cocoa that their <lb n="206" />
             people sent them in tins. They said they could not drink the tea; <lb n="207" />
             that it was hogwash. Their fathers were magistrates, the fel- <lb n="208" />
             lows said.<lb n="209" /> </p>
            <p> All the boys seemed to him very strange. They had all fa- <lb n="210" />
             thers and mothers and different clothes and voices. He longed <lb n="211" />
             to be at home and lay his head on his mother's lap. But he <lb n="212" />
             could not: and so he longed for the play and study and prayers <lb n="213" />
             to be over and to be in bed.<lb n="214" /> </p>
            <p> He drank another cup of hot tea and <persName> Fleming </persName> said:<lb n="215" /> </p>
            <p> <said who="Fleming">&#8213;What's up? Have you a pain or what's up with you? <lb n="216" /></said> </p>
            <p> <said who="Stephen">&#8213;I don't know, <persName> Stephen </persName> said. <lb n="217" /></said> </p>
            <p> <said who="Fleming">&#8213;Sick in your breadbasket, <persName> Fleming </persName> said, because your face <lb n="218" />
             looks white. It will go away. <lb n="219" /></said> </p>
            <p> <said who="Stephen">&#8213;O yes, <persName> Stephen </persName> said. <lb n="220" /></said> </p>
            <p> But he was not sick there. He thought that he was sick in his <lb n="221" />
             heart if you could be sick in that place. <persName> Fleming </persName> was very <lb n="222" />
             decent to ask him. He wanted to cry. He leaned his elbows on <lb n="223" />
             the table and shut and opened the flaps of his ears. Then he <lb n="224" />
             heard the noise of the refectory every time he opened the flaps <lb n="225" />
             of his ears. It made a roar like a train at night. And when he <lb n="226" />
             closed the flaps the roar was shut off like a train going into a <lb n="227" />
             tunnel. That night at <place> <location> <geo> 53.277911 -6.105844 </geo> </location> <placeName> Dalkey </placeName> </place> the train had roared like that and <lb n="228" />
             then, when it went into the tunnel, the roar stopped. He closed <lb n="229" />
             his eyes and the train went on, roaring and then stopping; <lb n="230" />
             roaring again, stopping. It was nice to hear it roar and stop and <lb n="231" />
             then roar out of the tunnel again and then stop.<lb n="232" /> </p>
            <p> Then the higher line fellows began to come down along the <lb n="233" />
             matting in the middle of the refectory, <persName> Paddy Rath </persName> and <persName> Jimmy <lb n="234" />
             Magee </persName> and the Spaniard who was allowed to smoke cigars and <lb n="235" />
             the little Portuguese who wore the woolly cap. And then the <lb n="236" />
             lower line tables and the tables of the third line. And every <lb n="237" />
             single fellow had a different way of walking.<lb n="238" /> </p>
            <p> He sat in a corner of the playroom pretending to watch a <lb n="239" />
             game of dominos and once or twice he was able to hear for an <lb n="240" />
             instant the little song of the gas. The prefect was at the door <lb n="241" />
             with some boys and <persName> Simon Moonan </persName> was knotting his false <lb n="242" />
             sleeves. He was telling them something about <place> <location> <geo> 52.888640 -8.428450 </geo> </location> <placeName> Tullabeg </placeName> </place>.<lb n="243" /> </p>
            <p> Then he went away from the door and <persName> Wells </persName> came over to <lb n="244" />
             <persName> Stephen </persName> and said:<lb n="245" /> </p>
            <p> <said who="Wells">&#8213;Tell us, <persName> Dedalus </persName>, do you kiss your mother every night before <lb n="246" />
             you go to bed? <lb n="247" /></said> </p>
            <p> <persName> Stephen </persName> answered:<lb n="248" /> </p>
            <p> <said who="Stephen">&#8213;I do. <lb n="249" /></said> </p>
            <p> <persName> Wells </persName> turned to the other fellows and said:<lb n="250" /> </p>
            <p> <said who="Wells">&#8213;O, I say, here's a fellow says he kisses his mother every night <lb n="251" />
             before he goes to bed. <lb n="252" /></said> </p>
            <p> The other fellows stopped their game and turned round, <lb n="253" />
             laughing. <persName> Stephen </persName> blushed under their eyes and said:<lb n="254" /> </p>
            <p> <said who="Stephen">&#8213;I do not. <lb n="255" /></said> </p>
            <p> <persName> Wells </persName> said:<lb n="256" /> </p>
            <p> <said who="Wells">&#8213;O, I say, here's a fellow says he doesn't kiss his mother <lb n="257" />
             before he goes to bed. <lb n="258" /></said> </p>
            <p> They all laughed again. <persName> Stephen </persName> tried to laugh with them. <lb n="259" />
             He felt his whole body hot and confused in a moment. What <lb n="260" />
             was the right answer to the question? He had given two and <lb n="261" />
             still <persName> Wells </persName> laughed. But <persName> Wells </persName> must know the right answer for <lb n="262" />
             he was in third of grammar. He tried to think of <persName> Wells </persName>'s mother <lb n="263" />
             but he did not dare to raise his eyes to <persName> Wells </persName>'s face. He did not <lb n="264" />
             like <persName> Wells </persName>'s face. It was <persName> Wells </persName> who had shouldered him into the <lb n="265" />
             square ditch the day before because he would not swop his <lb n="266" />
             little <seg type="neologism"> snuffbox </seg> for <persName> Wells </persName>'s seasoned hacking chestnut, the con- <lb n="267" />
             queror of forty. It was a mean thing to do; all the fellows said it <lb n="268" />
             was. And how cold and slimy the water had been! And a fellow <lb n="269" />
             had once seen a big rat jump plop into the scum.<lb n="270" /> </p>
            <p> The cold slime of the ditch covered his whole body; and, <lb n="271" />
             when the bell rang for study and the lines filed out of the <lb n="272" />
             playrooms, he felt the cold air of the corridor and staircase <lb n="273" />
             inside his clothes. He still tried to think what was the right <lb n="274" />
             answer. Was it right to kiss his mother or wrong to kiss his <lb n="275" />
             mother? What did that mean, to kiss? You put your face up like <lb n="276" />
             that to say goodnight and then his mother put her face down. <lb n="277" />
             That was to kiss. His mother put her lips on his cheek; her lips <lb n="278" />
             were soft and they wetted his cheek; and they made a tiny little <lb n="279" />
             noise: kiss. Why did people do that with their two faces?<lb n="280" /> </p>
            <p> Sitting in the <seg type="neologism"> studyhall </seg> he opened the lid of his desk and <lb n="281" />
             changed the number pasted up inside from <seg type="neologism"> seventyseven </seg> to <lb n="282" />
             <seg type="neologism"> seventysix </seg>. But the Christmas vacation was very far away: but <lb n="283" />
             one time it would come because the earth moved round always.<lb n="284" /> </p>
            <p> There was a picture of the earth on the first page of his <lb n="285" />
             geography: a big ball in the middle of clouds. <persName> Fleming </persName> had a <lb n="286" />
             box of crayons and one night during free study he had coloured <lb n="287" />
             the earth green and the clouds maroon. That was like the two <lb n="288" />
             brushes in <persName> Dante </persName>'s press, the brush with the green velvet back <lb n="289" />
             for <persName> Parnell </persName> and the brush with the maroon velvet back for <lb n="290" />
             <persName> Michael Davitt </persName>. But he had not told <persName> Fleming </persName> to colour them <lb n="291" />
             those colours. <persName> Fleming </persName> had done it himself.<lb n="292" /> </p>
            <p> He opened the geography to study the lesson; but he could <lb n="293" />
             not learn the names of places in <placeName> America </placeName>. Still they were all <lb n="294" />
             different places that had those different names. They were all in <lb n="295" />
             different countries and the countries were in continents and the <lb n="296" />
             continents were in the world and the world was in the universe.<lb n="297" /> </p>
            <p> He turned to the flyleaf of the geography and read what he <lb n="298" />
             had written there: himself, his name and where he was.<lb n="299" /> </p>

            <p> He read the verses backwards but then they were not poetry. <lb n="315" />
             Then he read the flyleaf from the bottom to the top till he came <lb n="316" />
             to his own name. That was he: and he read down the page <lb n="317" />
             again. What was after <placeName> the universe </placeName>? Nothing. But was there <lb n="318" />
             anything round <placeName> the universe </placeName> to show where it stopped before <lb n="319" />
             the nothing place began? It could not be a wall but there could <lb n="320" />
             be a thin thin line there all round everything. It was very big to <lb n="321" />
             think about everything and everywhere. Only <persName> God </persName> could do <lb n="322" />
             that. He tried to think what a big thought that must be but he <lb n="323" />
             could think only of <persName> God </persName>. <persName> God </persName> was <persName> God </persName>'s name just as his name <lb n="324" />
             was <persName> Stephen </persName>. <persName> <emph> Dieu </emph> </persName> was the French for <persName> God </persName> and that was <persName> God </persName>'s <lb n="325" />
             name too; and when anyone prayed to <persName> God </persName> and said <persName> <emph> Dieu </emph> </persName> then <lb n="326" />
             <persName> God </persName> knew at once that it was a French person that was pray- <lb n="327" />
              ing. But though there were different names for <persName> God </persName> in all the <lb n="328" />
             different languages in the world and <persName> God </persName> understood what all <lb n="329" />
             the people who prayed said in their different languages still <lb n="330" />
             <persName> God </persName> remained always the same <persName> God </persName> and <persName> God </persName>'s real name was <lb n="331" />
             <persName> God </persName>.<lb n="332" /> </p>
            <p> It made him very tired to think that way. It made him feel <lb n="333" />
             his head very big. He turned over the flyleaf and looked wearily <lb n="334" />
             at the green round earth in the middle of the maroon clouds. <lb n="335" />
             He wondered which was right, to be for the green or for the <lb n="336" />
             maroon, because <persName> Dante </persName> had ripped the green velvet back off <lb n="337" />
             the brush that was for <persName> Parnell </persName> one day with her scissors and <lb n="338" />
             had told him that <persName> Parnell </persName> was a bad man. He wondered if they <lb n="339" />
             were arguing at home about that. That was called politics. <lb n="340" />
             There were two sides in it: <persName> Dante </persName> was on one side and his <lb n="341" />
             father and <persName> Mr Casey </persName> were on the other side but his mother and <lb n="342" />
             <persName> uncle Charles </persName> were on no side. Every day there was something <lb n="343" />
             in the paper about it.<lb n="344" /> </p>
            <p> It pained him that he did not know well what politics meant <lb n="345" />
             and that he did not know where the universe ended. He felt <lb n="346" />
             small and weak. When would he be like the fellows in poetry <lb n="347" />
             and rhetoric? They had big voices and big boots and they <lb n="348" />
             studied trigonometry. That was very far away. First came the <lb n="349" />
             vacation and then the next term and then vacation again and <lb n="350" />
             then again another term and then again the vacation. It was <lb n="351" />
             like a train going in and out of tunnels and that was like the <lb n="352" />
             noise of the boys eating in the refectory when you opened and <lb n="353" />
             closed the flaps of the ears. Term, vacation; tunnel, out; noise, <lb n="354" />
             stop. How far away it was! It was better to go to bed to sleep. <lb n="355" />
             Only prayers in the chapel and then bed. He shivered and <lb n="356" />
             yawned. It would be lovely in bed after the sheets got a bit hot. <lb n="357" />
             First they were so cold to get into. He shivered to think how <lb n="358" />
             cold they were first. But then they got hot and then he could <lb n="359" />
             sleep. It was lovely to be tired. He yawned again. Night prayers <lb n="360" />
             and then bed: he shivered and wanted to yawn. It would be <lb n="361" />
             lovely in a few minutes. He felt a warm glow creeping up from <lb n="362" />
             the cold shivering sheets, warmer and warmer till he felt warm <lb n="363" />
             all over, ever so warm; ever so warm and yet he shivered a little <lb n="364" />
             and still wanted to yawn.<lb n="365" /> </p>
            <p> The bell rang for night prayers and he filed out of the <seg type="neologism"> study- <lb n="366" />
             hall </seg> after the others and down the staircase and along the <lb n="367" />
             corridors to the chapel. The corridors were darkly lit and the <lb n="368" />
             chapel was darkly lit. Soon all would be dark and sleeping. <lb n="369" />
             There was cold night air in the chapel and the marbles were the <lb n="370" />
             colour the sea was at night. The sea was cold day and night: <lb n="371" />
             but it was colder at night. It was cold and dark under the <lb n="372" />
             seawall beside his father's house. But the kettle would be on the <lb n="373" />
             hob to make punch.<lb n="374" /> </p>
            <p> The prefect of the chapel prayed above his head and his <lb n="375" />
             memory knew the responses:<lb n="376" /> </p>
            <lg type="prayer">
               <l> <emph> O Lord, open our lips </emph> </l> <lb n="377" />
               <l> <emph> And our mouth shall announce Thy praise. </emph> </l> <lb n="378" />
               <l> <emph> Incline unto our aid, O God! </emph> </l> <lb n="379" />
               <l> <emph> O Lord, make haste to help us! </emph> </l> <lb n="380" />
            </lg>
            <p> There was a cold night smell in the chapel. But it was a holy <lb n="381" />
             smell. It was not like the smell of the old peasants who knelt at <lb n="382" />
             the back of the chapel at Sunday mass. That was a smell of air <lb n="383" />
             and rain and turf and corduroy. But they were very holy peas- <lb n="384" />
             ants. They breathed behind him on his neck and sighed as they <lb n="385" />
             prayed. They lived in <place> <location> <geo> 53.293785 -6.687040 </geo> </location> <placeName> Clane </placeName>, </place>, a fellow said: there were little <lb n="386" />
             cottages there and he had seen a woman standing at the <seg type="neologism"> half- <lb n="387" />
             door </seg> of a cottage with a child in her arms, as the cars had come <lb n="388" />
             past from <place> <location> <geo> 53.251067 -6.665231 </geo> </location> <placeName> Sallins </placeName> </place>. It would be lovely to sleep for one night in <lb n="389" />
             that cottage before the fire of smoking turf, in the dark lit by <lb n="390" />
             the fire, in the warm dark, breathing the smell of the peasants, <lb n="391" />
             air and rain and turf and corduroy. But, O, the road there <lb n="392" />
             between the trees was dark! You would be lost in the dark. It <lb n="393" />
             made him afraid to think of how it was.<lb n="394" /> </p>
            <p> He heard the voice of the prefect of the chapel saying the last <lb n="395" />
             prayer. He prayed it too against the dark outside under the <lb n="396" />
             trees.<lb n="397" /> </p>
            <p> <seg type="prayer"> Visit, we beseech Thee, O Lord, this habitation and <lb n="398" />
             drive away from it all the snares of the enemy. May <lb n="399" />
             Thy holy angels dwell herein to preserve us in peace <lb n="400" />
             and may Thy blessing be always upon us through <lb n="401" />
             Christ, Our Lord. Amen. </seg><lb n="402" /> </p>
            <p> His fingers trembled as he undressed himself in the dormi- <lb n="403" />
             tory. He told his fingers to hurry up. He had to undress and <lb n="404" />
             then kneel and say his own prayers and be in bed before the gas <lb n="405" />
             was lowered so that he might not go to hell when he died. He <lb n="406" />
             rolled his stockings off and put on his nightshirt quickly and <lb n="407" />
             knelt trembling at his bedside and repeated his prayers quickly <lb n="408" />
             quickly fearing that the gas would go down. He felt his shoul- <lb n="409" />
            ders shaking as he murmured:<lb n="410" /> </p>
            <lg type="prayer">
               <l> God bless my father and my mother and spare them to <lb n="411" />
               me! </l> <lb n="412" />
               <l> God bless my little brothers and sisters and spare them <lb n="413" />
               to me! </l> <lb n="414" />
               <l> God bless <persName> Dante </persName> and <persName> uncle Charles </persName> and spare them to <lb n="415" />
               me! </l> <lb n="416" />
            </lg>
            <p> He blessed himself and climbed quickly into bed and, tuck- <lb n="417" />
             ing the end of the nightshirt under his feet, curled himself to <lb n="418" />
             gether under the cold white sheets, shaking and trembling. But <lb n="419" />
             he would not go to hell when he died; and the shaking would <lb n="420" />
             stop. A voice bade the boys in the dormitory goodnight. He <lb n="421" />
             peered out for an instant over the coverlet and saw the yellow <lb n="422" />
             curtains round and before his bed that shut him off on all sides. <lb n="423" />
             The light was lowered quietly.<lb n="424" /> </p>
            <p> The prefect's shoes went away. Where? Down the staircase <lb n="425" />
             and along the corridors or to his room at the end? He saw the <lb n="426" />
             dark. Was it true about the black dog that walked there at night <lb n="427" />
             with eyes as big as <seg type="neologism"> carriagelamps </seg>? They said it was the ghost of <lb n="428" />
             a murderer. A long shiver of fear flowed over his body. He saw <lb n="429" />
             the dark entrance hall of the castle. Old servants in old dress <lb n="430" />
             were in the <seg type="neologism"> ironingroom </seg> above the staircase. It was long ago. <lb n="431" />
             The old servants were quiet. There was a fire there but the hall <lb n="432" />
             was still dark. A figure came up the staircase from the hall. He <lb n="433" />
             wore the white cloak of a marshal; his face was pale and <lb n="434" />
             strange; he held his hand pressed to his side. He looked out of <lb n="435" />
             strange eyes at the old servants. They looked at him and saw <lb n="436" />
             their master's face and cloak and knew that he had received his <lb n="437" />
             <seg type="neologism"> deathwound </seg>. But only the dark was where they looked: only <lb n="438" />
             dark silent air. Their master had received his <seg type="neologism"> deathwound </seg> on <lb n="439" />
             the battlefield of <place> <location> <geo> 50.075538 14.437800 </geo> </location> <placeName> Prague </placeName> </place> far away over the sea. He was standing <lb n="440" />
             on the field; his hand was pressed to his side; his face was pale <lb n="441" />
             and strange and he wore the white cloak of a marshal.<lb n="442" /> </p>
            <p> O how cold and strange it was to think of that! All the dark <lb n="443" />
             was cold and strange. There were pale strange faces there, great <lb n="444" />
             eyes like <seg type="neologism"> carriagelamps </seg>. They were the ghosts of murderers, the <lb n="445" />
             figures of marshals who had received their <seg type="neologism"> deathwound </seg> on <lb n="446" />
             battlefields far away over the sea. What did they wish to say <lb n="447" />
             that their faces were so strange?<lb n="448" /> </p>
            <p> <seg type="prayer"> Visit, we beseech Thee, O Lord, this habitation and drive <lb n="449" />
             away from it all.... </seg><lb n="450" /> </p>
            <p> Going home for the holidays! That would be lovely: the <lb n="451" />
             fellows had told him. Getting up on the cars in the early wintry <lb n="452" />
             morning outside the door of the castle. The cars were rolling <lb n="453" />
             on the gravel. Cheers for the rector!<lb n="454" /> </p>
            <p> Hurray! Hurray! Hurray!<lb n="455" /> </p>
            <p> The cars drove past the chapel and all caps were raised. <lb n="456" />
             They drove merrily along the country roads. The drivers <lb n="457" />
             pointed with their whips to <place> <location> <geo> 53.262617 -6.666295 </geo> </location> <placeName> Bodenstown </placeName> </place>. The fellows cheered. <lb n="458" />
             They passed the farmhouse of the Jolly Farmer. Cheer after <lb n="459" />
            The fellows cheered. They passed the farmhouse of the Jolly Farmer. Cheer after
             cheer after cheer. Through <place> <location> <geo> 53.293785 -6.687040 </geo> </location> <placeName> Clane </placeName> </place> they drove, cheering and <lb n="460" />
             cheered. The peasant women stood at the <seg type="neologism"> halfdoors </seg>, the men <lb n="461" />
             stood here and there. The lovely smell there was in the wintry <lb n="462" />
             air: the smell of Clane: rain and wintry air and turf smoul- <lb n="463" />
             dering and corduroy.<lb n="464" /> </p>
            <p> The train was full of fellows: a long long chocolate train <lb n="465" />
             with cream facings. The guards went to and fro opening, <lb n="466" />
             closing, locking, unlocking the doors. They were men in dark <lb n="467" />
             blue and silver; they had silvery whistles and their keys made a <lb n="468" />
             quick music: click, click: click, click.<lb n="469" /> </p>
            <p> And the train raced on over the flat lands and past the <place> <location> <geo> 53.230556 -6.866389 </geo> </location> <placeName> Hill <lb n="470" />
             of Allen </placeName> </place>. The <seg type="neologism"> telegraphpoles </seg> were passing, passing. The train <lb n="471" />
             went on and on. It knew. There were coloured lanterns in the <lb n="472" />
             hall of his father's house and ropes of green branches. There <lb n="473" />
             were holly and ivy round the <seg type="neologism"> pierglass </seg> and holly and ivy, green <lb n="474" />
             and red, twined round the chandeliers. There were red holly <lb n="475" />
             and green ivy round the old portraits on the walls. Holly and <lb n="476" />
             ivy for him and for Christmas.<lb n="477" /> </p>
            <p> Lovely......<lb n="478" /> </p>
            <p> All the people. Welcome home, <persName> Stephen </persName>! Noises of welcome. <lb n="479" />
             His mother kissed him. Was that right? His father was a mar- <lb n="480" />

            <p> Noises...<lb n="482" /> </p>
            <p> There was a noise of <seg type="neologism"> curtainrings </seg> running back along the <lb n="483" />
             rods, of water being splashed in the basins. There was a noise <lb n="484" />
             of rising and dressing and washing in the dormitory: a noise of <lb n="485" />
             clapping of hands as the prefect went up and down telling the <lb n="486" />
             fellows to look sharp. A pale sunlight showed the yellow cur- <lb n="487" />
             tains drawn back, the tossed beds. His bed was very hot and his <lb n="488" />
             face and body were very hot.<lb n="489" /> </p>
            <p> He got up and sat on the side of his bed. He was weak. He <lb n="490" />
             tried to pull on his stocking. It had a horrid rough feel. The <lb n="491" />
             sunlight was queer and cold.<lb n="492" /> </p>

            <p> <said who="Fleming">&#8213;Get back into bed. I'll tell <persName> McGlade </persName> you're not well. <lb n="496" /></said> </p>
            <p> <said who="Fleming">&#8213;He's sick. <lb n="497" /></said> </p>
            <p> <said who="">&#8213;Who is? <lb n="498" /></said> </p>
            <p> <said who="Fleming">&#8213;Tell <persName> McGlade </persName>. <lb n="499" /></said> </p>

            <p> <said who="">&#8213;Is he sick? <lb n="501" /></said> </p>
            <p> A fellow held his arms while he loosened the stocking cling- <lb n="502" />
             ing to his foot and climbed back into the hot bed.<lb n="503" /> </p>
            <p> He crouched down between the sheets, glad of their tepid <lb n="504" />
             glow. He heard the fellows talk among themselves about him <lb n="505" />
             as they dressed for mass. It was a mean thing to do, to shoulder <lb n="506" />
             him into the square ditch, they were saying.<lb n="507" /> </p>
            <p> Then their voices ceased; they had gone. A voice at his bed <lb n="508" />
             said:<lb n="509" /> </p>
            <p> <said who="Wells">&#8213; <persName> Dedalus </persName>, don't spy on us, sure you won't? <lb n="510" /></said> </p>
            <p> <persName> Wells </persName>'s face was there. He looked at it and saw that <persName> Wells </persName> <lb n="511" />
             was afraid.<lb n="512" /> </p>
            <p> <said who="Wells">&#8213;I didn't mean to. Sure you won't? <lb n="513" /></said> </p>
            <p> His father had told him, whatever he did, never to peach on <lb n="514" />
             a fellow. He shook his head and answered no and felt glad. <lb n="515" />
             <persName> Wells </persName> said:<lb n="516" /> </p>
            <p> <said who="Wells">&#8213;I didn't mean to, honour bright. It was only for cod. I'm <lb n="517" />
             sorry. <lb n="518" /></said> </p>
            <p> The face and the voice went away. Sorry because he was <lb n="519" />
             afraid. Afraid that it was some disease. Canker was a disease of <lb n="520" />
             plants and cancer one of animals: or another different. That <lb n="521" />
             was a long time ago then out on the playgrounds in the evening <lb n="522" />
             light, creeping from point to point on the fringe of his line, a <lb n="523" />
             heavy bird flying low through the grey light. <placeName> Leicester Abbey </placeName> lit <lb n="524" />
             up. <persName> Wolsey </persName> died there. The abbots buried him themselves.<lb n="525" /> </p>
            <p> It was not <persName> Wells </persName>'s face, it was the prefect's. He was not <lb n="526" />
             foxing. No, no: he was sick really. He was not foxing. And he <lb n="527" />
             felt the prefect's hand on his forehead; and he felt his forehead <lb n="528" />
             warm and damp against the prefect's cold damp hand. That <lb n="529" />
             was the way a rat felt, slimy and damp and cold. Every rat had <lb n="530" />
             two eyes to look out of. Sleek slimy coats, little little feet <lb n="531" />
             tucked up to jump, black shiny eyes to look out of. They could <lb n="532" />
             understand how to jump. But the minds of rats could not <lb n="533" />
             understand trigonometry. When they were dead they lay on <lb n="534" />
             their sides. Their coats dried then. They were only dead things.<lb n="535" /> </p>
            <p> The prefect was there again and it was his voice that was <lb n="536" />
             saying that he was to get up, that <persName> Father Minister </persName> had said he <lb n="537" />
             was to get up and dress and go to the infirmary. And while he <lb n="538" />
             was dressing himself as quickly as he could the prefect said:<lb n="539" /> </p>
            <p> <said who="the prefect">&#8213;We must pack off to <persName> Brother Michael </persName> because we have the <lb n="540" />
             collywobbles. Terrible thing to have the collywobbles! How we <lb n="541" />
             wobble when we have the collywobbles! <lb n="542" /></said> </p>
            <p> He was very decent to say that. That was all to make him <lb n="543" />
             laugh. But he could not laugh because his cheeks and lips were <lb n="544" />
             all shivery: and then the prefect had to laugh by himself.<lb n="545" /> </p>
            <p> The prefect cried:<lb n="546" /> </p>
            <p> <said who="the prefect">&#8213;Quick march! Hayfoot! Strawfoot! <lb n="547" /></said> </p>
            <p> They went together down the staircase and along the corri- <lb n="548" />
             dor and past the bath. As he passed the door he remembered <lb n="549" />
             with a vague fear the warm <seg type="neologism"> turfcoloured </seg> bogwater, the warm <lb n="550" />
             moist air, the noise of plunges, the smell of the towels, like <lb n="551" />
             medicine.<lb n="552" /> </p>
            <p> <persName> Brother Michael </persName> was standing at the door of the infirmary <lb n="553" />
             and from the door of the dark cabinet on his right came a smell <lb n="554" />
             like medicine. That came from the bottles on the shelves. The <lb n="555" />
             prefect spoke to <persName> Brother Michael </persName> and <persName> Brother Michael </persName> <lb n="556" />
             answered and called the prefect sir. He had reddish hair mixed <lb n="557" />
             with grey and a queer look. It was queer that he would always <lb n="558" />
             be a brother. It was queer too that you could not call him sir <lb n="559" />
             because he was a brother and had a different kind of look. Was <lb n="560" />
             he not holy enough or why could he not catch up on the others?<lb n="561" /> </p>
            <p> There were two beds in the room and in one bed there was a <lb n="562" />
             fellow: and when they went in he called out:<lb n="563" /> </p>
            <p> <said who="Athy">&#8213;Hello! It's young <persName> Dedalus </persName>! What's up? <lb n="564" /></said> </p>
            <p> <said who="Brother Michael">&#8213;The sky is up, <persName> Brother Michael </persName> said. <lb n="565" /></said> </p>
            <p> He was a fellow out of the third of grammar and, while <persName> Stephen </persName> <lb n="566" />
             was undressing, he asked <persName> Brother Michael </persName> to bring him a round <lb n="567" />
             of buttered toast.<lb n="568" /> </p>
            <p> <said who="Athy">&#8213;Ah, do! he said. <lb n="569" /></said> </p>
            <p> <said who="Brother Michael">&#8213;Butter you up! said <persName> Brother Michael </persName>. You'll get your walking <lb n="570" />
             papers in the morning when the doctor comes. <lb n="571" /></said> </p>
            <p> <said who="Athy">&#8213;Will I? the fellow said. I'm not well yet. <lb n="572" /></said> </p>
            <p> <persName> Brother Michael </persName> repeated:<lb n="573" /> </p>
            <p> <said who="Athy">&#8213;You'll get your walking papers, I tell you. <lb n="574" /></said> </p>
            <p> He bent down to rake the fire. He had a long back like the <lb n="575" />
             long back of a <seg type="neologism"> tramhorse </seg>. He shook the poker gravely and <lb n="576" />
             nodded his head at the fellow out of third of grammar.<lb n="577" /> </p>
            <p> Then <persName> Brother Michael </persName> went away and after a while the fel- <lb n="578" />
             low out of third of grammar turned in towards the wall and fell <lb n="579" />
             asleep.<lb n="580" /> </p>
            <p> That was the infirmary. He was sick then. Had they written <lb n="581" />
             home to tell his mother and father? But it would be quicker for <lb n="582" />
             one of the priests to go himself to tell them. Or he would write <lb n="583" />
             a letter for the priest to bring.<lb n="584" /> </p>
            <lg type="letter">
               <l> <emph> Dear Mother </emph> </l> <lb n="585" />
               <l> <emph> I am sick. I want to go home. Please come and take <lb n="586" />
               me home. I am in the infirmary. </emph> </l> <lb n="587" />
               <l> <emph> Your fond son, </emph> </l> <lb n="588" />
               <l> <emph> <persName> Stephen </persName> </emph> </l> <lb n="589" />
            </lg>
            <p> How far away they were! There was cold sunlight outside <lb n="590" />
             the window. He wondered if he would die. You could die just <lb n="591" />
             the same on a sunny day. He might die before his mother came. <lb n="592" />
             Then he would have a dead mass in the chapel like the way the <lb n="593" />
             fellows had told him it was when <persName> Little </persName> had died. All the fellows would be at the mass, dressed in black, all with sad faces. <lb n="594" />
             <persName> Wells </persName> too would be there but no fellow would look at him. The <lb n="596" />
             rector would be there in a cope of black and gold and there <lb n="597" />
             would be tall yellow candles on the altar and round the cata- <lb n="598" />
             falque. And they would carry the coffin out of the chapel <lb n="599" />
             slowly and he would be buried in the little graveyard of the <lb n="600" />
             community off the main avenue of limes. And <persName> Wells </persName> would be <lb n="601" />
             sorry then for what he had done. And the bell would toll <lb n="602" />
             slowly.<lb n="603" /> </p>
            <p> He could hear the tolling. He said over to himself the song <lb n="604" />
             that <persName> Brigid </persName> had taught him.<lb n="605" /> </p>
            <lg type="song">
               <l> <emph> Dingdong! The castle bell! </emph> </l> <lb n="606" />
               <l> <emph> Farewell, my mother! </emph> </l> <lb n="607" />
               <l> <emph> Bury me in the old churchyard </emph> </l> <lb n="608" />
               <l> <emph> Beside my eldest brother. </emph> </l> <lb n="609" />
               <l> <emph> My coffin shall be black, </emph> </l> <lb n="610" />
               <l> <emph> Six angels at my back, </emph> </l> <lb n="611" />
               <l> <emph> Two to sing and two to pray </emph> </l> <lb n="612" />
               <l> <emph> And two to carry my soul away. </emph> </l> <lb n="613" />
            </lg>
            <p> How beautiful and sad that was! How beautiful the words <lb n="614" />
             were where they said <emph> Bury me in the old churchyard </emph>! A tremor <lb n="615" />
             passed over his body. How sad and how beautiful! He wanted <lb n="616" />
             to cry quietly but not for himself: for the words, so beautiful <lb n="617" />
             and sad, like music. The bell! The bell! Farewell! O farewell!<lb n="618" /> </p>
            <p> The cold sunlight was weaker and <persName> Brother Michael </persName> was <lb n="619" />
             standing at his bedside with a bowl of <seg type="neologism"> beeftea </seg>. He was glad for <lb n="620" />
             his mouth was hot and dry. He could hear them playing on the <lb n="621" />
             playgrounds. It was after lunchtime. And the day was going on <lb n="622" />
             in the college just as if he were there.<lb n="623" /> </p>
            <p> Then <persName> Brother Michael </persName> was going away and the fellow out of <lb n="624" />
             third of grammar told him to be sure and come back and tell <lb n="625" />
             him all the news in the paper. He told <persName> Stephen </persName> that his name <lb n="626" />
             was <persName> Athy </persName> and that his father kept a lot of racehorses that were <lb n="627" />
             spiffing jumpers and that his father would give a good tip to <lb n="628" />
             <persName> Brother Mi- <lb n="629" />
             chael </persName> any time he wanted it because <persName> Brother Michael </persName> was very decent and always told him the news out of the <lb n="630" />
             paper they got every day up in the castle. There was every kind <lb n="631" />
             of news in the paper: accidents, shipwrecks, sports and politics.<lb n="632" /> </p>
            <p> <said who="Athy">&#8213;Now it is all about politics in the paper, he said. Do your <lb n="633" />
             people talk about that too? <lb n="634" /></said> </p>
            <p> <said who="Stephen">&#8213;Yes, <persName> Stephen </persName> said. <lb n="635" /></said> </p>
            <p> <said who="Athy">&#8213;Mine too, he said. <lb n="636" /></said> </p>
            <p> Then he thought for a moment and said:<lb n="637" /> </p>
            <p> <said who="Athy">&#8213;You have a queer name, <persName> Dedalus </persName>, and I have a queer name <lb n="638" />
             too, <place> <location> <geo> 52.991834 -6.985728 </geo> </location> <placeName> <persName> Athy </persName> </placeName> </place>. My name is the name of a town. Your name is like <lb n="639" />
             Latin. <lb n="640" /></said> </p>
            <p> Then he asked:<lb n="641" /> </p>
            <p> <said who="Athy">&#8213;Are you good at riddles? <lb n="642" /></said> </p>
            <p> <persName> Stephen </persName> answered:<lb n="643" /> </p>
            <p> <said who="Stephen">&#8213;Not very good. <lb n="644" /></said> </p>
            <p> Then he said:<lb n="645" /> </p>
            <p> <said who="Athy">&#8213;Can you answer me this one? Why is the county <placeName> Kildare </placeName> like <lb n="646" />
             the leg of a fellow's breeches? <lb n="647" /></said> </p>
            <p> <persName> Stephen </persName> thought what could be the answer and then said:<lb n="648" /> </p>
            <p> <said who="Stephen">&#8213;I give it up. <lb n="649" /></said> </p>
            <p> <said who="Athy">&#8213;Because there is a thigh in it, he said. Do you see the joke? <lb n="650" />
             <placeName> <persName> Athy </persName> </placeName> is the town in the county <placeName> Kildare </placeName> and a thigh is the other <lb n="651" />
             thigh. <lb n="652" /></said> </p>
            <p> <said who="Stephen">&#8213;O, I see, <persName> Stephen </persName> said. <lb n="653" /></said> </p>
            <p> <said who="Athy">&#8213;That's an old riddle, he said. <lb n="654" /></said> </p>
            <p> After a moment he said:<lb n="655" /> </p>
            <p> <said who="Athy">&#8213;I say! <lb n="656" /></said> </p>
            <p> <said who="Stephen">&#8213;What? asked <persName> Stephen </persName>. <lb n="657" /></said> </p>
            <p> <said who="Athy">&#8213;You know, he said, you can ask that riddle another way? <lb n="658" /></said> </p>
            <p> <said who="Stephen">&#8213;Can you? said <persName> Stephen </persName>. <lb n="659" /></said> </p>
            <p> <said who="Athy">&#8213;The same riddle, he said. Do you know the other way to ask <lb n="660" />
             it?<lb n="661" /></said> </p>
            <p> <said who="Stephen">&#8213;No, said <persName> Stephen </persName>. <lb n="662" /></said> </p>
            <p> <said who="Athy">&#8213;Can you not think of the other way? he said. <lb n="663" /></said> </p>
            <p> He looked at <persName> Stephen </persName> over the bedclothes as he spoke. Then <lb n="664" />
             he lay back on the pillow and said:<lb n="665" /> </p>
            <p> <said who="Athy">&#8213;There is another way but I won't tell you what it is. <lb n="666" /></said> </p>
            <p> Why did he not tell it? His father, who kept the racehorses, <lb n="667" />
             must be a magistrate too like <persName> Saurin </persName>'s father and <persName> Nasty Roche </persName>'s <lb n="668" />
             father. He thought of his own father, of how he sang songs <lb n="669" />
             while his mother played and of how he always gave him a <lb n="670" />
             shilling when he asked for sixpence and he felt sorry for him <lb n="671" />
             that he was not a magistrate like the other boys' fathers. Then <lb n="672" />
             why was he sent to that place with them? But his father had <lb n="673" />
             told him that he would be no stranger there because his grand- <lb n="674" />
             uncle had presented an address to the liberator there fifty years <lb n="675" />
             before. You could know the people of that time by their old <lb n="676" />
             dress. It seemed to him a solemn time: and he wondered if that <lb n="677" />
             was the time when the fellows in <placeName> Clongowes </placeName> wore blue coats <lb n="678" />
             with brass buttons and yellow waistcoats and caps of <seg type="neologism"> rabbit- <lb n="679" />
            skin </seg> and drank beer like grownup people and kept greyhounds <lb n="680" />
             of their own to course the hares with.<lb n="681" /> </p>
            <p> He looked at the window and saw that the daylight had <lb n="682" />
             grown weaker. There would be cloudy grey light over the play- <lb n="683" />
             grounds. There was no noise on the playgrounds. The class <lb n="684" />
             must be doing the themes or perhaps <persName> Father Arnall </persName> was reading <lb n="685" />
             a legend out of the book.<lb n="686" /> </p>
            <p> It was queer that they had not given him any medicine. <lb n="687" />
             Perhaps <persName> Brother Michael </persName> would bring it back when he came. <lb n="688" />
             They said you got stinking stuff to drink when you were in the <lb n="689" />
             infirmary. But he felt better now than before. It would be nice <lb n="690" />
             getting better slowly. You could get a book then. There was a <lb n="691" />
             book in the library about <placeName> Holland </placeName>. There were lovely foreign <lb n="692" />
             names in it and pictures of <seg type="neologism"> strangelooking </seg> cities and ships. It <lb n="693" />
             made you feel so happy.<lb n="694" /> </p>
            <p> How pale the light was at the window! But that was nice. <lb n="695" />
             The fire rose and fell on the wall. It was like waves. Someone <lb n="696" />
             had put coal on and he heard voices. They were talking. It was <lb n="697" />
             the noise of the waves. Or the waves were talking among them- <lb n="698" />
            selves as they rose and fell.<lb n="699" /> </p>
            <p> He saw the sea of waves, long dark waves rising and falling, <lb n="700" />
             dark under the moonless night. A tiny light twinkled at the <lb n="701" />
             pierhead where the ship was entering: and he saw a multitude <lb n="702" />
             of people gathered by the waters' edge to see the ship that was <lb n="703" />
             entering their harbour. A tall man stood on the deck, looking <lb n="704" />
             out towards the flat dark land: and by the light at the pierhead <lb n="705" />
             he saw his face, the sorrowful face of <persName> Brother Michael </persName>.<lb n="706" /> </p>
            <p> He saw him lift his hand towards the people and heard him <lb n="707" />
             say in a loud voice of sorrow over the waters:<lb n="708" /> </p>
            <p> <said who="Brother Michael">&#8213;He is dead. We saw him lying upon the catafalque. <lb n="709" /></said> </p>
            <p> A wail of sorrow went up from the people.<lb n="710" /> </p>
            <p> <said who="the people">&#8213;<persName>Parnell</persName>! <persName> Parnell </persName>! He is dead! <lb n="711" /></said> </p>
            <p> They fell upon their knees, moaning in sorrow.<lb n="712" /> </p>
            <p> And he saw <persName> Dante </persName> in a maroon velvet dress and with a green <lb n="713" />
             velvet mantle hanging from her shoulders walking proudly and <lb n="714" />
             silently past the people who knelt by the waters' edge.<lb n="715" /> </p>

            <p>  All were waiting: <persName>uncle Charles</persName>, who sat far away in the <lb n="723" />
             shadow of the window, <persName>Dante</persName> and <persName>Mr Casey</persName>, who sat in the <lb n="724" />
             <seg type="neologism">easychairs</seg> at either side of the hearth, <persName>Stephen</persName>, seated on a <lb n="725" />
             chair between them, his feet resting on the toasted boss. <persName>Mr <lb n="726" />
             Dedalus</persName> looked at himself in the <seg type="neologism">pierglass</seg> above the mantel- <lb n="727" />
             piece, waxed out his moustache ends and then, parting his <lb n="728" />
             coattails, stood with his back to the glowing fire: and still, from <lb n="729" />
             time to time, he withdrew a hand from his coattail to wax out <lb n="730" />
             one of his moustache ends. <persName>Mr Casey</persName> leaned his head to one <lb n="731" />
             side and, smiling, tapped the gland of his neck with his fingers. <lb n="732" />
             And <persName>Stephen</persName> smiled too for he knew now that it was not true <lb n="733" />
             that <persName>Mr Casey</persName> had a purse of silver in his throat. He smiled to <lb n="734" />
             think how the silvery noise which <persName>Mr Casey</persName> used to make had <lb n="735" />
             deceived him. And when he had tried to open <persName>Mr Casey</persName>'s hand <lb n="736" />
             to see if the purse of silver was hidden there he had seen that <lb n="737" />
             the fingers could not be straightened out: and <persName>Mr Casey</persName> had <lb n="738" />
             told him that he had got those three cramped fingers making a <lb n="739" />
             birthday present for <persName>Queen Victoria</persName>.<lb n="740" /> </p>
            <p>  <persName>Mr Casey</persName> tapped the gland of his neck and smiled at <persName>Stephen</persName>Ste- <lb n="741" />
             phen with sleepy eyes: and <persName>Mr Dedalus</persName> said to him: <lb n="742" />
             <said who="Simon Dedalus">&#8213;Yes. Well now, that's all right. O, we had a good walk, <lb n="743" />
             hadn't we, <persName>John</persName>? Yes ...... I wonder if there's any likelihood of <lb n="744" />
             dinner this evening. Yes ..... O, well now, we got a good breath <lb n="745" />
             of ozone round <place><location><geo>53.190760 -6.089490</geo></location><placeName>the Head</placeName></place> today. Ay, bedad. <lb n="746" /></said> </p>
            <p>  He turned to <persName>Dante</persName> and said: <lb n="747" />
             <said who="John Casey">&#8213;You didn't stir out at all, <persName>Mrs Riordan</persName>? <lb n="748" /></said> </p>
            <p>  <persName>Dante</persName> frowned and said shortly: <lb n="749" />
             <said who="Dante">&#8213;No. <lb n="750" /></said> </p>
            <p>  <persName>Mr Dedalus</persName> dropped his coattails and went over to the side- <lb n="751" />
             sideboard. He brought forth a great stone jar of whisky from the <lb n="752" />
             locker and filled the decanter slowly, bending now and then to <lb n="753" />
             see how much he had poured in. Then replacing the jar in the <lb n="754" />
             locker he poured out a little of the whisky into two glasses, <lb n="755" />
             added a little water and came with them back to the fireplace. <lb n="756" />
             <said who="Simon Dedalus">&#8213;A thimbleful, <persName>John</persName>, he said. Just to whet your appetite. <lb n="757" /></said> </p>
            <p>  <persName>Mr Casey</persName> took the glass, drank, and placed it near him on <lb n="758" />
             the mantelpiece. Then he said: <lb n="759" />
             <said who="John Casey">&#8213;Well, I can't help thinking of our friend <persName>Christopher</persName> manu- <lb n="760" />
             facturing .... <lb n="761" /></said> </p>
            <p>  He broke into a fit of laughter and coughing and added: <lb n="762" />
             <said who="John Casey">&#8213;... manufacturing that champagne for those fellows. <lb n="763" /></said> </p>
            <p>  <persName>Mr Dedalus</persName> laughed loudly. <lb n="764" />
             <said who="Simon Dedalus">&#8213;Is it <persName>Christy</persName>? he said. There's more cunning in one of those <lb n="765" />
             warts on his bald head than in a pack of jack foxes. <lb n="766" /></said> </p>
            <p>  He inclined his head, closed his eyes, and, licking his lips <lb n="767" />
             profusely, began to speak with the voice of the hotel keeper. <lb n="768" />
             <said who="Simon Dedalus">&#8213;And he has such a soft mouth when he's speaking to you, <lb n="769" />
             don't you know. He's very moist and watery about the dew- <lb n="770" />
             dewlaps, God bless him. <lb n="771" /></said> </p>
            <p>  <persName>Mr Casey</persName> was still struggling through his fit of coughing and <lb n="772" />
             laughter. <persName>Stephen</persName>, seeing and hearing the hotel keeper through <lb n="773" />
             his father's face and voice, laughed.<lb n="774" /> </p>
            <p>  <persName>Mr Dedalus</persName> put up his eyeglass and, staring down at him, <lb n="775" />
             said quietly and kindly: <lb n="776" />
             <said who="Simon Dedalus">&#8213;What are you laughing at, you little puppy, you? <lb n="777" /></said> </p>
            <p>  The servants entered and placed the dishes on the table. <persName>Mrs <lb n="778" />
             Dedalus</persName> followed and the places were arranged. <lb n="779" />
             <said who="Mary Dedalus">&#8213;Sit over, she said. <lb n="780" /></said> </p>
            <p>  <persName>Mr Dedalus</persName> went to the end of the table and said: <lb n="781" />
             <said who="Simon Dedalus">&#8213;Now, <persName>Mrs Riordan</persName>, sit over. <persName>John</persName>, sit you down, my hearty. <lb n="782" /></said> </p>
            <p>  He looked round to where <persName>uncle Charles</persName> sat and said: <lb n="783" />
             <said who="Simon Dedalus">&#8213;Now then, sir, there's a bird here waiting for you. <lb n="784" /></said> </p>
            <p>  When all had taken their seats he laid his hand on the cover <lb n="785" />
             and then said quickly, withdrawing it: <lb n="786" />
             <said who="Simon Dedalus">&#8213;Now, <persName>Stephen</persName>. <lb n="787" /></said> </p>
            <p>  <persName>Stephen</persName> stood up in his place to say the grace before meals:<lb n="788" /> </p>
            <p>  <seg type="prayer"> <said who="Stephen"> <lg> <l>Bless us, O Lord, and these Thy gifts which through</l> <lb n="789" />
             <l>Thy bounty we are about to receive through Christ</l> <lb n="790" />
             <l>Our Lord. Amen. </l> </lg> <lb n="791" /> </said> </seg> </p>
            <p>  All blessed themselves and <persName>Mr Dedalus</persName> with a sigh of pleas- <lb n="792" />
             ure lifted from the dish the heavy cover pearled around the <lb n="793" />
             edge with glistening drops.<lb n="794" /> </p>
            <p>  <persName>Stephen</persName> looked at the plump turkey which had lain, trussed <lb n="795" />
             and skewered, on the kitchen table. He knew that his father <lb n="796" />
             had paid a guinea for it in <place><location><geo>53.346308 -6.257925</geo></location><placeName>Dunn's of D'Olier Street</placeName></place> and that the <lb n="797" />
             man had prodded it often at the breastbone to show how good <lb n="798" />
             it was: and he remembered the man's voice when he had said: <lb n="799" />
             <said who="the butcher">&#8213;Take that one, sir. That's the real Ally Daly. <lb n="800" /></said> </p>
            <p>  Why did <persName>Mr Barrett</persName> in Clongowes call his pandybat a tur- <lb n="801" />
             key? It was not like a turkey. But Clongowes was far away: and <lb n="802" />
             the warm heavy smell of turkey and ham and celery rose from <lb n="803" />
             the plates and dishes and the great fire was banked high and <lb n="804" />
             red in the grate and the green ivy and red holly made you feel <lb n="805" />
             so happy and when dinner was ended the big plumpudding <lb n="806" />
             would be carried in, studded with peeled almonds and sprigs of <lb n="807" />
             holly, with bluish fire running around it and a little green flag <lb n="808" />
             flying from the top.<lb n="809" /> </p>
            <p>  It was his first Christmas dinner and he thought of his little <lb n="810" />
             brothers and sisters who were waiting in the nursery, as he had <lb n="811" />
             often waited, till the pudding came. The deep low collar and <lb n="812" />
             the <place><location><geo>51.487402 -0.607942</geo></location><placeName>Eton</placeName></place> jacket made him feel queer and oldish: and that morn- <lb n="813" />
             ing when his mother had brought him down to the parlour, <lb n="814" />
             dressed for mass, his father had cried. That was because he was <lb n="815" />
             thinking of his own father. And <persName>uncle Charles</persName> had said so too.<lb n="816" /> </p>
            <p>  <persName>Mr Dedalus</persName> covered the dish and began to eat hungrily. <lb n="817" />
             Then he said: <lb n="818" />
             <said who="Simon Dedalus">&#8213;Poor old Christy, he's nearly lopsided now with roguery. <lb n="819" /> </said>
             <said who="Mary Dedalus">&#8213;<persName>Simon</persName>, said <persName>Mrs Dedalus</persName>, you haven't given <persName>Mrs Riordan</persName> <lb n="820" />
             any sauce. <lb n="821" /></said> </p>
            <p>  <persName>Mr Dedalus</persName> seized the sauceboat. <lb n="822" />
             <said who="Simon Dedalus">&#8213;Haven't I?  he cried. <persName>Mrs Riordan</persName>, pity the poor blind. <lb n="823" /></said> </p>
            <p>  <persName>Dante</persName> covered her plate with her hands and said: <lb n="824" />
             <said who="Dante">&#8213;No, thanks. <lb n="825" /></said> </p>
            <p>  <persName>Mr Dedalus</persName> turned to <persName>uncle Charles</persName>. <lb n="826" />
             <said who="Simon Dedalus">&#8213;How are you off, sir? <lb n="827" /> </said>
             <said who="Uncle Charles">&#8213;Right as the mail, <persName>Simon</persName>. <lb n="828" /> </said>
             <said who="Simon Dedalus">&#8213;You, <persName>John</persName>? <lb n="829" /> </said>
             <said who="John Casey">&#8213;I'm all right. Go on yourself. <lb n="830" /> </said>
             <said who="Simon Dedalus">&#8213;Mary? Here, <persName>Stephen</persName>, here's something to make your hair <lb n="831" />
             curl. <lb n="832" /></said> </p>
            <p>  He poured sauce freely over <persName>Stephen</persName>'s plate and set the boat <lb n="833" />
             again on the table. Then he asked <persName>uncle Charles</persName> was it tender. <lb n="834" />
             <persName>Uncle Charles</persName> could not speak because his mouth was full but <lb n="835" />
             he nodded that it was. <lb n="836" />
             <said who="Simon Dedalus">&#8213;That was a good answer our friend made to the canon. <lb n="837" />
             What? said <persName>Mr Dedalus</persName>. <lb n="838" /> </said>
             <said who="John Casey">&#8213;I didn't think he had that much in him, said <persName>Mr Casey</persName>. <lb n="839" /> </said>
             <said who="Simon Dedalus">&#8213;<quote>I'll pay you your dues, father, when you cease turning the <lb n="840" />

             <said who="Dante">&#8213;A nice answer, said <persName>Dante</persName>, for any man calling himself a <lb n="842" />

             <said who="Simon Dedalus">&#8213;They have only themselves to blame, said <persName>Mr Dedalus</persName> <lb n="844" />
             suavely. If they took a fool's advice they would confine their <lb n="845" />
             attention to religion. <lb n="846" /> </said>
             <said who="Dante">&#8213;It is religion, Dante said. They are doing their duty in warn- <lb n="847" />

             <said who="Dante">&#8213;It is religion, <persName>Dante</persName> said again. They are right. They must <lb n="851" />

             <said who="Simon Dedalus">&#8213;And preach politics from the altar, is it? asked <persName>Mr Dedalus</persName>. <lb n="853" /> </said>
             <said who="Dante">&#8213;Certainly, said <persName>Dante</persName>. It is a question of public morality. A <lb n="854" />
             priest would not be a priest if he did not tell his flock what is <lb n="855" />
             right and what is wrong. <lb n="856" /></said> </p>
            <p>  <persName>Mrs Dedalus</persName> laid down her knife and fork, saying: <lb n="857" />
             <said who="Mary Dedalus">&#8213;For pity's sake and for pity' sake let us have no political <lb n="858" />
             discussion on this day of all days in the year. <lb n="859" /> </said>
             <said who="Uncle Charles">&#8213;Quite right, ma'am, said <persName>uncle Charles</persName>. Now, <persName>Simon</persName>, that's <lb n="860" />

            <p>  He uncovered the dish boldly and said: <lb n="863" />
             <said who="Simon Dedalus">&#8213;Now then, who's for more turkey? <lb n="864" /></said> </p>
            <p>  Nobody answered. <persName>Dante</persName> said: <lb n="865" />
             <said who="Dante">&#8213;Nice language for any catholic to use! <lb n="866" /> </said>

            <p>  He heaped up the food on Stephen's plate and served uncle <lb n="898" />

             with the carvers at the end of the dish and said: <lb n="902" />
             <said who="Simon Dedalus">&#8213;There's a tasty bit here we call the pope's nose. If any lady <lb n="903" />
             or gentleman .....<lb n="904" /></said> </p>
            <p>  He held a piece of fowl up on the prong of the <seg type="neologism">carvingfork</seg>. <lb n="905" />
             Nobody spoke. He put it on his own plate, saying: <lb n="906" />
             <said who="Simon Dedalus">&#8213;Well, you can't say but you were asked. I think I had better <lb n="907" />
             eat it myself because I'm not well in my health lately. <lb n="908" /></said> </p>
            <p>  He winked at Stephen and, replacing the dishcover, began to <lb n="909" />
             eat again.<lb n="910" /> </p>
            <p>  There was a silence while he ate. Then he said: <lb n="911" />
             <said who="Simon Dedalus">&#8213;Well now, the day kept up fine after all. There were plenty <lb n="912" />
             of strangers down too. <lb n="913" /></said> </p>
            <p>  Nobody spoke. He said again: <lb n="914" />
             <said who="Simon Dedalus">&#8213;I think there were more strangers down than last Christmas. <lb n="915" /></said> </p>
            <p>  He looked round at the others whose faces were bent to- <lb n="916" />
             towards their plates and, receiving no reply, waited for a moment <lb n="917" />
             and said bitterly: <lb n="918" />
             <said who="Simon Dedalus">&#8213;Well, my Christmas dinner has been spoiled anyhow. <lb n="919" /> </said>
             <said who="Dante">&#8213;There could be neither luck nor grace, Dante said, in a house <lb n="920" />
             where there is no respect for the pastors of the church. <lb n="921" /></said> </p>
            <p>  Mr Dedalus threw his knife and fork noisily on his plate. <lb n="922" />
             <said who="Simon Dedalus">&#8213;Respect! he said. Is it for Billy with the lip or for the tub of <lb n="923" />
             guts up in <place><location><geo>54.350280 -6.652792</geo></location><placeName>Armagh</placeName></place>? Respect! <lb n="924" /> </said>
             <said who="John Casey">&#8213;Princes of the church, said Mr Casey with slow scorn. <lb n="925" /> </said>
             <said who="Simon Dedalus">&#8213;Lord Leitrim's coachman, yes, said Mr Dedalus. <lb n="926" /> </said>
             <said who="Dante">&#8213;They are the Lord's anointed, Dante said. They are an hon- <lb n="927" />
             our to their country. <lb n="928" /> </said>
             <said who="Simon Dedalus">&#8213;Tub of guts, said Mr Dedalus coarsely. He has a handsome <lb n="929" />
             face, mind you, in repose. You should see that fellow lapping <lb n="930" />
             up his bacon and cabbage of a cold winter's day. O Johnny! <lb n="931" /></said> </p>
            <p>  He twisted his features into a grimace of heavy bestiality and <lb n="932" />
             made a lapping noise with his lips. <lb n="933" />
             <said who="Mary Dedalus">&#8213;Really, Simon, said Mrs Dedalus, you should not speak that <lb n="934" />
             way before Stephen. It's not right. <lb n="935" /> </said>
             <said who="Dante">&#8213;O, he'll remember all this when he grows up, said Dante <lb n="936" />
             hotly, - the language he heard against God and religion and <lb n="937" />
             priests in his own home. <lb n="938" /> </said>
             <said who="John Casey">&#8213;Let him remember too, cried Mr Casey to her from across <lb n="939" />
             the table, the language with which the priests and the priests' <lb n="940" />
             pawns broke Parnell's heart and hounded him into his grave. <lb n="941" />
             Let him remember that too when he grows up. <lb n="942" /> </said>
             <said who="Simon Dedalus">&#8213;Sons of bitches! cried Mr Dedalus. When he was down they <lb n="943" />
             turned on him to betray him and rend him like rats in a sewer. <lb n="944" />
             <seg type="neologism">Lowlived</seg> dogs! And they look it! By Christ, they look it! <lb n="945" /> </said>
             <said who="Dante">&#8213;They behaved rightly, cried Dante. They obeyed their <lb n="946" />
             bishops and their priests. Honour to them! <lb n="947" /> </said>
             <said who="Mary Dedalus">&#8213;Well, it is perfectly dreadful to say that not even for one day <lb n="948" />
             of the year, said Mrs Dedalus, can we be free from these dread- <lb n="949" />
             ful disputes! <lb n="950" /></said> </p>
            <p>  Uncle Charles raised his hands mildly and said: <lb n="951" />
             <said who="Uncle Charles">&#8213;Come now, come now, come now! Can we not have our <lb n="952" />
             opinions whatever they are without this bad temper and this <lb n="953" />
             bad language? It is too bad surely. <lb n="954" /></said> </p>
            <p>  Mrs Dedalus spoke to Dante in a low voice but Dante said <lb n="955" />
             loudly: <lb n="956" />
             <said who="Dante">&#8213;I will not say nothing. I will defend my church and my <lb n="957" />
             religion when it is insulted and spit on by renegade catholics. <lb n="958" /></said> </p>
            <p>  Mr Casey pushed his plate rudely into the middle of the <lb n="959" />
             table and, resting his elbows before him, said in a harsh voice <lb n="960" />
             to his host: <lb n="961" />
             <said who="John Casey">&#8213;Tell me, did I tell you that story about a very famous spit? <lb n="962" /> </said>
             <said who="Simon Dedalus">&#8213;You did not, John, said Mr Dedalus. <lb n="963" /> </said>
             <said who="John Casey">&#8213;Why then, said Mr Casey, it is a most instructive story. It <lb n="964" />
             happened not long ago in the <place><location><geo> 52.986231 -6.367254</geo></location><placeName>county Wicklow</placeName></place> where we are <lb n="965" />
             now. <lb n="966" /></said> </p>
            <p>  He broke off and, turning towards Dante, said with quiet <lb n="967" />
             indignation: <lb n="968" />
             <said who="John Casey">&#8213;And I may tell you, ma'am, that I, if you mean me, am no <lb n="969" />
             renegade catholic. I am a catholic as my father was and his <lb n="970" />
             father before him and his father before him again when we <lb n="971" />
             gave up our lives rather than sell our faith. <lb n="972" /> </said>
             <said who="Dante">&#8213;The more shame to you now, Dante said, to speak as you <lb n="973" />
             do. <lb n="974" /> </said>
             <said who="Simon Dedalus">&#8213;The story, John, said Mr Dedalus smiling. Let us have the <lb n="975" />
             story anyhow. <lb n="976" /> </said>
             <said who="Dante">&#8213;Catholic indeed! repeated Dante ironically. The blackest <lb n="977" />
             protestant in the land would not speak the language I have <lb n="978" />
             heard this evening. <lb n="979" /></said> </p>
            <p>  Mr Dedalus began to sway his head to and fro, crooning like <lb n="980" />
             a country singer. <lb n="981" />
             <said who="John Casey">&#8213;I am no protestant, I tell you again, said Mr Casey flushing. <lb n="982" /></said> </p>
            <p>  Mr Dedalus, still crooning and swaying his head, began to <lb n="983" />
             sing in a grunting nasal tone: <lb n="984" />
            <said who="Simon Dedalus"> <seg type="song">
              <lg>
                 <l>O, come all you Roman catholics</l> <lb n="985" />
                 <l>That never went to mass.</l> <lb n="986" />
              </lg>
            </seg> </said></p>
            <p>  He took up his knife and fork again in good humour and set <lb n="987" />
             to eating, saying to Mr Casey: <lb n="988" />
             <said who="Simon Dedalus">&#8213;Let us have the story, John. It will help us to digest. <lb n="989" /></said> </p>
            <p>  Stephen looked with affection at Mr Casey's face which <lb n="990" />
             stared across the table over his joined hands. He liked to sit <lb n="991" />
             near him at the fire, looking up at his dark fierce face. But his <lb n="992" />
             dark eyes were never fierce and his slow voice was good to <lb n="993" />
             listen to. But why was he then against the priests? Because <lb n="994" />
             Dante must be right then. But he had heard his father say that <lb n="995" />
             she was a spoiled nun and that she had come out of the convent <lb n="996" />
             in the Alleghanies when her brothers had got the money from <lb n="997" />
             the savages for the trinkets and  <seg type="neologism">chainies</seg>. Perhaps that made her <lb n="998" />
             severe against Parnell. And she did not like him to play with <lb n="999" />
             Eileen because Eileen was a protestant and when she was <lb n="1000" />
             young she knew children that used to play with protestants and <lb n="1001" />
             the protestants used to make fun of the litany of the Blessed <lb n="1002" />
             Virgin. <emph>Tower of Ivory</emph>, they used to say, <emph>House of Gold!</emph> How <lb n="1003" />
             could a woman be a tower of ivory or a house of gold? Who <lb n="1004" />
             was right then? And he remembered the evening in the infirm- <lb n="1005" />
             ary in Clongowes, the dark waters, the light at the pierhead <lb n="1006" />
             and the moan of sorrow from the people when they had heard.<lb n="1007" /> </p>
            <p>  Eileen had long white hands. One evening when playing tig <lb n="1008" />
             she had put her hands over his eyes: long and white and thin <lb n="1009" />
             and cold and soft. That was ivory: a cold white thing. That <lb n="1010" />
             was the meaning of <emph>Tower of Ivory</emph>. <lb n="1011" />
             <said who="John Casey">&#8213;The story is very short and sweet, Mr Casey said. It was one <lb n="1012" />
             day down in <place><location><geo>52.797693 -6.159929</geo></location><placeName>Arklow</placeName></place>, a cold bitter day, not long before the <lb n="1013" />
             chief died. May God have mercy on him! <lb n="1014" /></said> </p>
            <p>  He closed his eyes wearily and paused. Mr Dedalus took a <lb n="1015" />
             bone from his plate and tore some meat from it with his teeth, <lb n="1016" />
             saying: <lb n="1017" />
             <said who="Simon Dedalus">&#8213;Before he was killed, you mean. <lb n="1018" /></said> </p>
            <p>  Mr Casey opened his eyes, sighed and went on: <lb n="1019" />
             <said who="John Casey">&#8213;It was down in Arklow one day. We were down there at a <lb n="1020" />
             meeting and after the meeting was over we had to make our <lb n="1021" />
             way to the railway station through the crowd. Such booing and <lb n="1022" />
             baaing, man, you never heard. They called us all the names in <lb n="1023" />
             the world. Well there was one old lady, and a drunken old <lb n="1024" />
             harridan she was surely, that paid all her attention to me. She <lb n="1025" />
             kept dancing along beside me in the mud bawling and scream- <lb n="1026" />
             ing into my face: <emph>Priesthunter! The <place><location><geo>48.856614 2.352222</geo></location><placeName>Paris</placeName></place> Funds! Mr Fox! Kitty <lb n="1027" />
             O'Shea!</emph> <lb n="1028" /> </said>
             <said who="Simon Dedalus">&#8213;And what did you do, John? asked Mr Dedalus. <lb n="1029" /> </said>
             <said who="John Casey">&#8213;I let her bawl away, said Mr Casey. It was a cold day and to <lb n="1030" />
             keep up my heart I had (saving your presence, ma'am) a quid of <lb n="1031" />
             <place><location><geo>53.275526 -7.493385</geo></location><placeName>Tullamore</placeName></place> in my mouth and sure I couldn't say a word in any <lb n="1032" />
             case because my mouth was full of tobacco juice. <lb n="1033" /> </said>
             <said who="Simon Dedalus">&#8213;Well, John? <lb n="1034" /> </said>
             <said who="John Casey">&#8213;Well. I let her bawl away to her heart's content <emph>Kitty O'Shea</emph> <lb n="1035" />
             and the rest of it till at last she called that lady a name that I <lb n="1036" />
             won't sully this Christmas board nor your ears, ma'am, nor my <lb n="1037" />
             own lips by repeating. <lb n="1038" /></said> </p>
            <p>  He paused. Mr Dedalus, lifting his head from the bone, <lb n="1039" />
             asked: <lb n="1040" />
             <said who="Simon Dedalus">&#8213;And what did you do, John? <lb n="1041" /> </said>
             <said who="John Casey">&#8213;Do! said Mr Casey. She stuck her ugly old face up at me <lb n="1042" />
             when she said it and I had my mouth full of tobacco juice. I <lb n="1043" />
             bent down to her and <emph>Phth!</emph> says I to her like that. <lb n="1044" /></said> </p>
            <p>  He turned aside and made the act of spitting. <lb n="1045" />
             <said who="John Casey">&#8213;<emph>Phth!</emph> says I to her like that, right into her eye. <lb n="1046" /></said> </p>
            <p>  He clapped a hand to his eye and gave a hoarse scream of <lb n="1047" />
             pain. <lb n="1048" />
             <said who="John Casey">&#8213;<emph>O Jesus, Mary and Joseph!</emph> says she. <emph>I'm blinded! I'm <lb n="1049" />
             blinded and drownded!</emph> <lb n="1050" /></said> </p>
            <p>  He stopped in a fit of coughing and laughter, repeating: <lb n="1051" />
             <said who="John Casey">&#8213;<emph>I'm blinded entirely!</emph><lb n="1052" /></said> </p>
            <p>  Mr Dedalus laughed loudly and lay back in his chair while <lb n="1053" />
             uncle Charles swayed his head to and fro.<lb n="1054" /> </p>
            <p>  Dante looked terribly angry and repeated while they <lb n="1055" />
             laughed: <lb n="1056" />
             <said who="Dante">&#8213;Very nice! Ha! Very nice! <lb n="1057" /></said> </p>
            <p>  It was not nice about the spit in the woman's eye. But what <lb n="1058" />
             was the name the woman had called Kitty O'Shea that Mr <lb n="1059" />
             Casey would not repeat? He thought of Mr Casey walking <lb n="1060" />
             through the crowds of people and making speeches from a <lb n="1061" />
             wagonette. That was what he had been in prison for and he <lb n="1062" />
             remembered that one night Sergeant O'Neill had come to the <lb n="1063" />
             house and had stood in the hall, talking in a low voice with his <lb n="1064" />
             father and chewing nervously at the chinstrap of his cap. And <lb n="1065" />
             that night Mr Casey had not gone to <place><location><geo>53.349805 -6.260310 </geo></location><placeName>Dublin</placeName></place> by train but a car <lb n="1066" />
             had come to the door and he had heard his father say some- <lb n="1067" />
             something about <place><location><geo>53.265647 -6.156109</geo></location><placeName>the Cabinteely road</placeName></place>.<lb n="1068" /> </p>
            <p>  He was for Ireland and Parnell and so was his father: and so <lb n="1069" />
             was Dante too for one night at the band on the esplanade she <lb n="1070" />
             had hit a gentleman on the head with her umbrella because he <lb n="1071" />
             had taken off his hat when the band played <emph>God save the <lb n="1072" />
             Queen</emph> at the end.<lb n="1073" /> </p>
            <p>  Mr Dedalus gave a snort of contempt. <lb n="1074" />
             <said who="Simon Dedalus">&#8213;Ah, John, he said. It is true for them. We are an unfortunate <lb n="1075" />
             <seg type="neologism">priestridden</seg> race and always were and always will be till the <lb n="1076" />
             end of the chapter. <lb n="1077" /></said> </p>
            <p>  Uncle Charles shook his head, saying: <lb n="1078" />
             <said who="Uncle Charles">&#8213;A bad business! A bad business! <lb n="1079" /></said> </p>
            <p>  Mr Dedalus repeated: <lb n="1080" />
             <said who="Simon Dedalus">&#8213;A <seg type="neologism">priestridden</seg> Godforsaken race! <lb n="1081" /></said> </p>
            <p>  He pointed to the portrait of his grandfather on the wall to <lb n="1082" />
             his right. <lb n="1083" />
             <said who="Simon Dedalus">&#8213;Do you see that old chap up there, John? he said. He was a <lb n="1084" />
             good Irishman when there was no money in the job. He was <lb n="1085" />
             condemned to death as a whiteboy. But he had a saying about <lb n="1086" />
             our clerical friends, that he would never let one of them put his <lb n="1087" />
             two feet under his mahogany. <lb n="1088" /></said> </p>
            <p>  Dante broke in angrily: <lb n="1089" />
             <said who="Dante">&#8213;If we are a <seg type="neologism">priestridden</seg> race we ought to be proud of it! <lb n="1090" />

             we not to follow the man that was born to lead us? <lb n="1094" /> </said>
             <said who="Dante">&#8213;A traitor to his country! replied Dante. A traitor, an adul- <lb n="1095" />
             adulterer! The priests were right to abandon him. The priests were <lb n="1096" />
             always the true friends of Ireland. <lb n="1097" /> </said>
             <said who="John Casey">&#8213;Were they, faith? said Mr Casey. <lb n="1098" /></said> </p>
            <p>  He threw his fist on the table and, frowning angrily, pro- <lb n="1099" />
             protruded one finger after another. <lb n="1100" />
             <said who="John Casey">&#8213;Didn't the bishops of Ireland betray us in the time of the <lb n="1101" />
             union when bishop Lanigan presented an address of loyalty to <lb n="1102" />
             the marquess Cornwallis? Didn't the bishops and priests sell <lb n="1103" />
             the aspirations of this country in 1829 in return for catholic <lb n="1104" />
             emancipation? Didn't they denounce the fenian movement <lb n="1105" />
             from the pulpit and in the <seg type="neologism">confession box</seg>? And didn't they <lb n="1106" />
             dishonour the ashes of Terence Bellew MacManus? <lb n="1107" /></said> </p>
            <p>  His face was glowing with anger and Stephen felt the glow <lb n="1108" />
             rise to his own cheek as the spoken words thrilled him. Mr <lb n="1109" />
             Dedalus uttered a guffaw of coarse scorn. <lb n="1110" />
             <said who="John Casey">&#8213;O, by God, he cried, I forgot little old Paul Cullen! Another <lb n="1111" />
             apple of God's eye! <lb n="1112" /></said> </p>
            <p>  Dante bent across the table and cried to Mr Casey: <lb n="1113" />
             <said who="Dante">&#8213;Right! Right! They were always right! God and morality and <lb n="1114" />
             religion come first. <lb n="1115" /></said> </p>
            <p>  Mrs Dedalus, seeing her excitement, said to her: <lb n="1116" />
             <said who="Mary Dedalus">&#8213;Mrs Riordan, don't excite yourself answering them. <lb n="1117" /> </said>
             <said who="Dante">&#8213;God and religion before everything! Dante cried. God and <lb n="1118" />
             religion before the world! <lb n="1119" /></said> </p>
            <p>  Mr Casey raised his clenched fist and brought it down on <lb n="1120" />
             the table with a crash. <lb n="1121" />
             <said who="John Casey">&#8213;Very well, then, he shouted hoarsely, if it comes to that, no <lb n="1122" />
             God for Ireland! <lb n="1123" /> </said>
             <said who="Simon Dedalus">&#8213;John! John! cried Mr Dedalus, seizing his guest by the coat <lb n="1124" />
             <seg type="neologism">coatsleeve</seg>. <lb n="1125" /></said> </p>
            <p>  Dante stared across the table, her cheeks shaking. Mr Casey <lb n="1126" />
             struggled up from his chair and bent across the table towards <lb n="1127" />
             her, scraping the air from before his eyes with one hand as <lb n="1128" />
             though he were tearing aside a cobweb. <lb n="1129" />
             <said who="John Casey">&#8213;No God for Ireland! he cried. We have had too much God in <lb n="1130" />
             Ireland. Away with God! <lb n="1131" /> </said>
             <said who="Dante">&#8213;Blasphemer! Devil! screamed Dante, starting to her feet and <lb n="1132" />
             almost spitting in his face. <lb n="1133" /></said> </p>
            <p>  Uncle Charles and Mr Dedalus pulled Mr Casey back into <lb n="1134" />
             his chair again, talking to him from both sides reasonably. He <lb n="1135" />
             stared before him out of his dark flaming eyes, repeating: <lb n="1136" />
             <said who="John Casey">&#8213;Away with God, I say! <lb n="1137" /></said> </p>
            <p>  Dante shoved her chair violently aside and left the table, <lb n="1138" />
             upsetting her <seg type="neologism">napkinring</seg> which rolled slowly along the carpet <lb n="1139" />
             and came to rest against the foot of an easychair. Mrs Dedalus <lb n="1140" />
             rose quickly and followed her towards the door. At the door <lb n="1141" />
             Dante turned round violently and shouted down the room, her <lb n="1142" />
             cheeks flushed and quivering with rage: <lb n="1143" />
             <said who="Dante">&#8213;Devil out of hell! We won! We crushed him to death! Fiend! <lb n="1144" /></said> </p>
            <p>  The door slammed behind her.<lb n="1145" /> </p>
            <p>  Mr Casey, freeing his arms from his holders, suddenly <lb n="1146" />
             bowed his head on his hands with a sob of pain. <lb n="1147" />
             <said who="John Casey">&#8213;Poor Parnell! he cried loudly. My dead king! <lb n="1148" /></said> </p>
            <p>  He sobbed loudly and bitterly.<lb n="1149" /> </p>
            <p>  Stephen, raising his <seg type="neologism">terrorstricken</seg> face, saw that his father's <lb n="1150" />

            <p>  The fellows talked together in little groups.<lb n="1152" /> </p>

             <said who="Cecil Thunder">&#8213;I know why, Cecil Thunder said. Because they had fecked <lb n="1161" />
             cash out of the rector's room. <lb n="1162" /> </said>
             <said who="a fellow">&#8213;Who fecked it? <lb n="1163" /> </said>
             <said who="John Casey">&#8213;Kickham's brother. And they all went shares in it. <lb n="1164" /></said> </p>
            <p>  But that was stealing. How could they have done that? <lb n="1165" />
             <said who="Wells">&#8213;A fat lot you know about it, Thunder! Wells said. I know <lb n="1166" />
             why they scut. <lb n="1167" /> </said>
             <said who="a fellow">&#8213;Tell us why. <lb n="1168" /> </said>
             <said who="Wells">&#8213;I was told not to, Wells said. <lb n="1169" /> </said>
             <said who="all">&#8213;O, go on, Wells, all said. You might tell us. We won't let it <lb n="1170" />
             out. <lb n="1171" /></said> </p>
            <p>  Stephen bent forward his head to hear. Wells looked round <lb n="1172" />
             to see if anyone was coming. Then he said secretly: <lb n="1173" />
             <said who="Wells">&#8213;You know the altar wine they keep in the press in the sac- <lb n="1174" />
             risty? <lb n="1175" /> </said>
             <said who="all">&#8213;Yes. <lb n="1176" /> </said>
             <said who="Wells">&#8213;Well, they drank that and it was found out who did it by the <lb n="1177" />
             smell. And that's why they ran away, if you want to know. <lb n="1178" /></said> </p>
            <p>  And the fellow who had spoken first said: <lb n="1179" />
             <said who="a fellow">&#8213;Yes, that's what I heard too from the fellow in the higher <lb n="1180" />
             line. <lb n="1181" /></said> </p>
            <p>  The fellows were all silent. Stephen stood among them, <lb n="1182" />
             afraid to speak, listening. A faint sickness of awe made him feel <lb n="1183" />
             weak. How could they have done that? He thought of the dark <lb n="1184" />
             silent sacristy. There were dark wooden presses there where the <lb n="1185" />
             crimped surplices lay quietly folded. It was not the chapel but <lb n="1186" />
             still you had to speak under your breath. It was a holy place. <lb n="1187" />
             He remembered the summer evening he had been there to be <lb n="1188" />
             dressed as <seg type="neologism">boatbearer</seg>, the evening of the procession to the little <lb n="1189" />
             altar in the wood. A strange and holy place. The boy that held <lb n="1190" />
             the censer had swung it gently to and fro near the door with the <lb n="1191" />
             silvery cap lifted by the middle chain to keep the coals lighting. <lb n="1192" />
             That was called charcoal: and it had burned quietly as the <lb n="1193" />
             fellow had swung it gently and had given off a weak sour smell. <lb n="1194" />
             And then when all were vested he had stood holding out the <lb n="1195" />
             boat to the rector and the rector had put a spoonful of incense <lb n="1196" />
             in  and it had hissed on the red coals.<lb n="1197" /> </p>
            <p>  The fellows were talking together in little groups here and <lb n="1198" />
             there on the playground. The fellows seemed to him to have <lb n="1199" />
             grown smaller: that was because a sprinter had knocked him <lb n="1200" />
             down the day before, a fellow out of second of grammar. He <lb n="1201" />
             had been thrown by the fellow's machine lightly on the cinder- <lb n="1202" />
             path and his spectacles had been broken in three pieces and <lb n="1203" />
             some of the grit of the cinders had gone into his mouth.<lb n="1204" /> </p>
            <p>  That was why the fellows seemed to him smaller and farther <lb n="1205" />
             away and the goalposts so thin and far and the soft grey sky so <lb n="1206" />
             high up. But there was no play on the football grounds for <lb n="1207" />
             cricket was coming: and some said that Barnes would be the <lb n="1208" />
             prof and some said it would be Flowers. And all over the play- <lb n="1209" />
             playgrounds they were playing rounders and bowling twisters and <lb n="1210" />
             lobs. And from here and from there came the sounds of the <lb n="1211" />
             <seg type="neologism">cricket bats</seg> through the soft grey air. They said: pick, pack, <lb n="1212" />
             pock, puck: like drops of water in a fountain slowly falling in <lb n="1213" />
             the brimming bowl.<lb n="1214" /> </p>
            <p>  Athy, who had been silent, said quietly: <lb n="1215" />
             <said who="Athy">&#8213;You are all wrong. <lb n="1216" /></said> </p>
            <p>  All turned towards him eagerly. <lb n="1217" />
             <said who="a fellow">&#8213;Why? <lb n="1218" /> </said>
             <said who="a fellow">&#8213;Do you know? <lb n="1219" /> </said>
             <said who="a fellow">&#8213;Who told you? <lb n="1220" /> </said>
             <said who="a fellow">&#8213;Tell us, Athy. <lb n="1221" /></said> </p>
            <p>  Athy pointed across the playground to where Simon <lb n="1222" />
             Moonan was walking by himself kicking a stone before him. <lb n="1223" />
             <said who="Athy">&#8213;Ask him, he said. <lb n="1224" /></said> </p>
            <p>  The fellows looked there and then said: <lb n="1225" />
             <said who="a fellow">&#8213;Why him? <lb n="1226" /> </said>
             <said who="a fellow">&#8213;Is he in it? <lb n="1227" /> </said>
             <said who="a fellow">&#8213;Tell us, Athy. Go on. You might if you know. <lb n="1228" /></said> </p>
            <p>  Athy lowered his voice and said: <lb n="1229" />
             <said who="Athy">&#8213;Do you know why those fellows scut? I will tell you but you <lb n="1230" />
             must not let on you know. <lb n="1231" /></said> </p>
            <p>  He paused for a moment and then said mysteriously: <lb n="1232" />
             <said who="Athy">&#8213;They were caught with Simon Moonan and Tusker Boyle in <lb n="1233" />
             the square one night. <lb n="1234" /></said> </p>
            <p>  The fellows looked at him and asked: <lb n="1235" />
             <said who="a fellow">&#8213;Caught? <lb n="1236" /> </said>
             <said who="a fellow">&#8213;What doing? <lb n="1237" /></said> </p>
            <p>  Athy said: <lb n="1238" />
             <said who="Athy">&#8213;Smugging. <lb n="1239" /></said> </p>
            <p>  All the fellows were silent: and Athy said: <lb n="1240" />
             <said who="Athy">&#8213;And that's why. <lb n="1241" /></said> </p>
            <p>  Stephen looked at the faces of the fellows but they were all <lb n="1242" />
             looking across the playground. He wanted to ask somebody <lb n="1243" />
             about it. What did that mean about the smugging in the <lb n="1244" />
             square? Why did the five fellows out of the higher line run <lb n="1245" />
             away for that? It was a joke, he thought. Simon Moonan had <lb n="1246" />
             nice clothes and one night he had shown him a ball of creamy <lb n="1247" />
             sweets that the fellows of the football fifteen had rolled down <lb n="1248" />
             to him along the carpet in the middle of the refectory when he <lb n="1249" />
             was at the door. It was the night of the match against the <lb n="1250" />
             Bective Rangers and the ball was made just like a red and green <lb n="1251" />
             apple only it opened and it was full of the creamy sweets. And <lb n="1252" />
             one day Boyle had said that an elephant had two tuskers in- <lb n="1253" />
             instead of two tusks and that was why he was called Tusker <lb n="1254" />
             Boyle but some fellows called him Lady Boyle because he was <lb n="1255" />
             always at his nails, paring them.<lb n="1256" /> </p>
            <p>  Eileen had long thin cool white hands too because she was a <lb n="1257" />
             girl. They were like ivory; only soft. That was the meaning of <lb n="1258" />
             <emph>Tower of Ivory</emph> but protestants could not understand it and <lb n="1259" />
             made fun of it. One day he had stood beside her looking into <lb n="1260" />
             the hotel grounds. A waiter was running up a trail of bunting <lb n="1261" />
             on the flagstaff and a fox terrier was scampering to and fro on <lb n="1262" />
             the sunny lawn. She had put her hand into his pocket where his <lb n="1263" />
             hand was and he had felt how cool and thin and soft her hand <lb n="1264" />
             was. She had said that pockets were funny things to have: and <lb n="1265" />
             then all of a sudden she had broken away and had run laughing <lb n="1266" />
             down the sloping curve of the path. Her fair hair had streamed <lb n="1267" />
             out behind her like gold in the sun. <emph>Tower of Ivory. House of <lb n="1268" />
             Gold.</emph> By thinking about things you could understand them.<lb n="1269" /> </p>
            <p>  But why in the square? You went there when you wanted to <lb n="1270" />
             do something. It was all thick slabs of slate and water trickled <lb n="1271" />
             all day out of tiny pinholes and there was a queer smell of stale <lb n="1272" />
             water there. And behind the door of one of the  closets there <lb n="1273" />
             was a drawing in red pencil of a bearded man in a Roman dress <lb n="1274" />
             with a brick in each hand and underneath was the name of the <lb n="1275" />
             drawing:<lb n="1276" /> </p>
            <p>  <l><emph>Balbus was building a wall.</emph> </l> <lb n="1277" /> </p>
            <p>  Some fellow had drawn it there for a cod. It had a funny <lb n="1278" />
             face but it was very like a man with a beard. And on the wall of <lb n="1279" />
             another closet there was written in backhand  in beautiful writ- <lb n="1280" />
             ing:<lb n="1281" /> </p>
            <p>  <l>Julius Caesar wrote The Calico Belly. </l> <lb n="1282" /> </p>
            <p>  Perhaps that was why they were there  because it was a place <lb n="1283" />
             where some fellows wrote things for cod. But all the same it <lb n="1284" />
             was queer what Athy said and the way he said it. It was not a <lb n="1285" />
             cod because they had run away. He looked with the others in <lb n="1286" />
             silence across the playground and began to feel afraid.<lb n="1287" /> </p>
            <p>  At last Fleming said: <lb n="1288" />
             <said who="Fleming">&#8213;And we are all to be punished for what other fellows did? <lb n="1289" /> </said>
             <said who="Cecil Thunder">&#8213;I won't come back, see if I do, Cecil Thunder said. Three <lb n="1290" />
             days' silence in the refectory and sending us up for six and eight <lb n="1291" />
             every minute. <lb n="1292" /> </said>
             <said who="Wells">&#8213;Yes, said Wells. And old Barrett has a new way of twisting <lb n="1293" />
             the note so that you can't open it and fold it again to see how <lb n="1294" />
             many ferul#.&#228;  you are to get. I won't come back too. <lb n="1295" /> </said>
             <said who="Cecil Thunder">&#8213;Yes, said Cecil Thunder, and the prefect of studies was in <lb n="1296" />
             second of grammar this morning. <lb n="1297" /> </said>
             <said who="Fleming">&#8213;Let us get up a rebellion, Fleming said. Will we? <lb n="1298" /></said> </p>
            <p>  All the fellows were silent. The air was very silent and you <lb n="1299" />
             could hear the cricket bats but more slowly than before: pick, <lb n="1300" />
             pock.<lb n="1301" /> </p>
            <p>  Wells asked: <lb n="1302" />
             <said who="Wells">&#8213;What is going to be done to them? <lb n="1303" /> </said>
             <said who="Athy">&#8213;Simon Moonan and Tusker are going to be flogged, Athy <lb n="1304" />
             said, and the fellows in the higher line got their choice of <lb n="1305" />
             flogging or being expelled. <lb n="1306" /> </said>
             <said who="a fellow">&#8213;And which are they taking? asked the fellow who had <lb n="1307" />
             spoken first. <lb n="1308" /> </said>
             <said who="Athy">&#8213;All are taking expulsion except Corrigan, Athy answered. <lb n="1309" />
             He's going to be flogged by Mr Gleeson. <lb n="1310" /> </said>
             <said who="Fleming">&#8213;Is it Corrigan that big fellow? said Fleming. Why, he'd be <lb n="1311" />
             able for two of Gleeson! <lb n="1312" /> </said>
             <said who="Cecil Thunder">&#8213;I know why, Cecil Thunder said. He is right and the other <lb n="1313" />
             fellows are wrong because a flogging wears off after a bit but a <lb n="1314" />
             fellow that has been expelled from college is known all his life <lb n="1315" />
             on  account of it. Besides Gleeson won't flog him hard. <lb n="1316" /> </said>
             <said who="Fleming">&#8213;It's best of his play not to, Fleming said. <lb n="1317" /> </said>
             <said who="Cecil Thunder">&#8213;I wouldn't like to be Simon Moonan and Tusker,  Cecil <lb n="1318" />
             Thunder said. But I don't believe they will be flogged. Perhaps <lb n="1319" />
             they will be sent up for twice nine. <lb n="1320" /> </said>
             <said who="Athy">&#8213;No, no, said Athy. They'll both get it on the vital spot. <lb n="1321" /></said> </p>
            <p>  Wells rubbed himself and said in a crying voice: <lb n="1322" />
             <said who="Wells">&#8213;Please, sir, let me off! <lb n="1323" /></said> </p>
            <p>  Athy grinned and turned up the sleeves of his jacket, saying: <lb n="1324" />
            <said who="Athy"> <seg type="chant">
              <lg>
                 <l>It can't be helped;</l> <lb n="1325" />
                 <l>It must be done.</l> <lb n="1326" />
                 <l>So down with your breeches</l> <lb n="1327" />
                 <l>And out with your bum.</l> <lb n="1328" />
              </lg>
            </seg> </said></p>
            <p>  The fellows laughed; but he felt that they were a little afraid. <lb n="1329" />
             In the silence of the soft grey air he heard the cricket bats from <lb n="1330" />
             here and from there: pock. That was a sound to hear but if you <lb n="1331" />
             were hit then you would feel a pain. The pandybat made a <lb n="1332" />
             sound too but not like that. The fellows said it was made of <lb n="1333" />
             whalebone and leather with lead inside: and he wondered what <lb n="1334" />
             was the pain like. There were different kinds of pains  for all the <lb n="1335" />
             different kinds of sounds. A long thin cane would have a high <lb n="1336" />
             whistling sound and he wondered what was that pain like. It <lb n="1337" />
             made him shivery to think of it and cold: and what Athy said <lb n="1338" />
             too. But what was there to laugh at in it? It made him shivery: <lb n="1339" />
             but that was because you always felt like a shiver when you let <lb n="1340" />
             down your trousers. It was the same in the bath when you <lb n="1341" />
             undressed yourself. He wondered who had to let them down, <lb n="1342" />
             the master or the boy himself. O how could they laugh about it <lb n="1343" />
             that way?<lb n="1344" /> </p>
            <p>  He looked at Athy's <seg type="neologism">rolledup</seg> sleeves and knuckly inky <lb n="1345" />
             hands. He had rolled up his sleeves to show how Mr Gleeson <lb n="1346" />
             would roll up his sleeves. But Mr Gleeson had round shiny <lb n="1347" />
             cuffs and clean white wrists and fattish white hands and the <lb n="1348" />
             nails of them were long and pointed. Perhaps he pared them <lb n="1349" />
             too like Lady Boyle. But they were terribly long and pointed <lb n="1350" />
             nails. So long and cruel they were though the white fattish <lb n="1351" />
             hands were not cruel but gentle. And though he trembled with <lb n="1352" />
             cold and fright to think of the cruel long nails and of the high <lb n="1353" />
             whistling sound of the cane and of the chill you felt at the end <lb n="1354" />
             of your shirt when you undressed yourself yet he felt a feeling <lb n="1355" />
             of queer quiet pleasure inside him to think of the white fattish <lb n="1356" />
             hands, clean and strong  and gentle. And he thought of what <lb n="1357" />
             Cecil Thunder had said; that Mr Gleeson would not flog Cor- <lb n="1358" />
             Corrigan hard. And Fleming had said he would not because it was <lb n="1359" />
             best of his play not to. But that was not why.<lb n="1360" /> </p>
            <p>  A voice from far out on the playgrounds cried: <lb n="1361" />
             <said who="a fellow">&#8213;All in! <lb n="1362" /></said> </p>
            <p>  And other voices cried: <lb n="1363" />
             <said who="other voices">&#8213;All in! All in! <lb n="1364" /></said> </p>
            <p>  During the writing lesson he sat with his arms folded, listen- <lb n="1365" />
             ing to the slow scraping of the pens. Mr Harford went to and <lb n="1366" />
             fro making little signs in red pencil and sometimes sitting <lb n="1367" />
             beside the boy to show him how to hold the pen. He had tried <lb n="1368" />
             to spell out the headline for himself though he knew already <lb n="1369" />
             what it was for it was the last in the book. <emph>Zeal without <lb n="1370" />
             prudence is like a ship adrift.</emph> But the lines of the letters were <lb n="1371" />
             like fine invisible threads and it was only by closing his right <lb n="1372" />
             eye tight tight and staring out of the left eye that he could make <lb n="1373" />
             out the full curves of the capital.<lb n="1374" /> </p>
            <p>  But Mr Harford was very decent and never got into a wax. <lb n="1375" />
             All the other masters got into dreadful waxes. But why were <lb n="1376" />
             they to suffer for what fellows in the higher line did? Wells had <lb n="1377" />
             said that they had drunk some of the altar wine out of the press <lb n="1378" />
             in the sacristy and that it had been found out who had done it <lb n="1379" />
             by the smell. Perhaps they had stolen a monstrance to run away <lb n="1380" />
             with it and sell it somewhere. That must have been a terrible <lb n="1381" />
             sin, to go in  quietly there at night, to open the dark press and <lb n="1382" />
             steal the flashing gold thing into which God was put on the <lb n="1383" />
             altar in the middle of flowers and candles at benediction while <lb n="1384" />
             the incense went up in clouds at both sides as the fellow swung <lb n="1385" />
             the censer and Dominic Kelly sang the first part by himself in <lb n="1386" />
             the choir. But God was not in it of course when they stole it. <lb n="1387" />
             But still it was a strange and a great sin even to touch it. He <lb n="1388" />
             thought of it with deep awe; a terrible and strange sin: it <lb n="1389" />
             thrilled him to think of it in the silence when the pens scraped <lb n="1390" />
             lightly. But to drink the altar wine out of the press and be <lb n="1391" />
             found out by the smell was a sin too: but it was not terrible <lb n="1392" />
             and strange. It only made you feel a little sickish on account <lb n="1393" />
             of the smell of the wine. Because on the day when he had <lb n="1394" />
             made his first holy communion in  the chapel he had shut his <lb n="1395" />
             eyes and opened his mouth and put out his tongue a little: and <lb n="1396" />
             when the rector had stooped down to give him the holy com- <lb n="1397" />
             communion he had smelt a faint winy smell off the rector's breath <lb n="1398" />
             after the wine of the mass. The word was beautiful: wine. It <lb n="1399" />
             made you think of dark purple because the grapes were dark <lb n="1400" />
             purple that grew in Greece outside houses like white temples. <lb n="1401" />
             But the faint smell off the rector's breath had made him feel <lb n="1402" />
             a sick feeling on the morning of his first communion. The day <lb n="1403" />
             of your first communion was the happiest day of your life. <lb n="1404" />
             And once a lot of generals had asked Napoleon what was the <lb n="1405" />
             happiest day of his life. They thought he would say the day <lb n="1406" />
             he won some great battle or the day he was made an emperor. <lb n="1407" />
             But he said: <lb n="1408" />
             <said who="Napoleon">&#8213;Gentlemen, the happiest day of my life was the day on which <lb n="1409" />
             I made my first holy communion. <lb n="1410" /></said> </p>
            <p>  Father Arnall came in and the Latin lesson began and he <lb n="1411" />
             remained still, leaning on the desk with his arms folded. Father <lb n="1412" />
             Arnall gave out the <seg type="neologism">themebooks</seg> and he said that they were <lb n="1413" />
             scandalous and that they were all to be written out again with <lb n="1414" />
             the corrections at once. But the worst of all was Fleming's <lb n="1415" />
             theme because the pages were stuck together by a blot: and <lb n="1416" />
             Father Arnall held it up by a corner and said it was an insult to <lb n="1417" />
             any master to send him up such a theme. Then he asked Jack <lb n="1418" />
             Lawton to decline the noun <emph>mare</emph> and Jack Lawton stopped at <lb n="1419" />
             the ablative singular and could not go on with the plural. <lb n="1420" />
             <said who="Father Arnall">&#8213;You should be ashamed of yourself, said Father Arnall <lb n="1421" />
             sternly. You, the leader of the class! <lb n="1422" /></said> </p>
            <p>  Then he asked the next boy and the next and the next. <lb n="1423" />
             Nobody knew. Father Arnall became very quiet, more and <lb n="1424" />
             more quiet as each boy tried to answer and could not. But his <lb n="1425" />
             face was <seg type="neologism">blacklooking</seg> and his eyes were staring though his <lb n="1426" />
             voice was so quiet. Then he asked Fleming and Fleming said <lb n="1427" />
             that that word had no plural. Father Arnall suddenly shut the <lb n="1428" />
             book and shouted at him: <lb n="1429" />
             <said who="Father Arnall">&#8213;Kneel out there in the middle of the class. You are one of the <lb n="1430" />
             idlest boys I ever met. Copy out your themes again the rest of <lb n="1431" />
             you. <lb n="1432" /></said> </p>
            <p>  Fleming moved heavily out of his place and knelt between <lb n="1433" />
             the two last benches. The other boys bent over their theme- <lb n="1434" />
             books and began to write. A silence filled the classroom and <lb n="1435" />
             Stephen, glancing timidly at Father Arnall's dark face, saw that <lb n="1436" />
             it was a little red from the wax he was in.<lb n="1437" /> </p>
            <p>  Was that a sin for Father Arnall to be in a wax or was he <lb n="1438" />
             allowed to get into a wax when the boys were idle because that <lb n="1439" />
             made them study better or was he only letting on to be in a <lb n="1440" />
             wax? It was because he was allowed because a priest would <lb n="1441" />
             know what a sin was and would not do it. But if he did it one <lb n="1442" />
             time by mistake what would he do to go to confession? Perhaps <lb n="1443" />
             he would go to confession to the minister. And if the minister <lb n="1444" />
             did it he would go to the rector: and the rector to the provin- <lb n="1445" />
             cial: and the provincial to the general of the jesuits. That was <lb n="1446" />
             called the order: and he had heard his father say that they were <lb n="1447" />
             all clever men. They could all have become <seg type="neologism">highup</seg> people in <lb n="1448" />
             the world if they had not become jesuits. And he wondered <lb n="1449" />
             what Father Arnall and Paddy Barrett would have become and <lb n="1450" />
             what Mr McGlade and Mr Gleeson would have become if they <lb n="1451" />
             had not become jesuits. It was hard to think what because you <lb n="1452" />
             would have to think of them in a different way with different <lb n="1453" />
             coloured coats and trousers and with beards and moustaches <lb n="1454" />
             and different kinds of hats.<lb n="1455" /> </p>
            <p>  The door opened quietly and closed. A quick whisper ran <lb n="1456" />
             through the class: the prefect of studies. There was an instant <lb n="1457" />
             of dead silence and then the loud crack of a pandybat on the <lb n="1458" />
             last desk. Stephen's heart leapt up in fear. <lb n="1459" />
             <said who="Father Dolan">&#8213;Any boys want flogging here, Father Arnall? cried the pre- <lb n="1460" />
             fect of studies. Any lazy idle loafers that want flogging in this <lb n="1461" />
             class? <lb n="1462" /></said> </p>
            <p>  He came to the middle of the class and saw Fleming on his <lb n="1463" />
             knees. <lb n="1464" />
             <said who="Father Dolan">&#8213;Hoho! he cried. Who is this boy? Why is he on his knees? <lb n="1465" />
             What is your name, boy? <lb n="1466" /> </said>
             <said who="Fleming">&#8213;Fleming, sir. <lb n="1467" /> </said>
             <said who="Father Dolan">&#8213;Hoho, Fleming! An idler of course. I can see it in your eye. <lb n="1468" />
             Why is he on his knees, Father Arnall? <lb n="1469" /> </said>
             <said who="Father Arnall">&#8213;He wrote a bad Latin theme, Father Arnall said, and he <lb n="1470" />
             missed all the questions in grammar. <lb n="1471" /> </said>
             <said who="Father Dolan">&#8213;Of course he did! cried the prefect of studies. Of course he <lb n="1472" />
             did! A born idler! I can see it in the corner of his eye. <lb n="1473" /></said> </p>
            <p>  He banged his pandybat down on the desk and cried: <lb n="1474" />
             <said who="Father Dolan">&#8213;Up, Fleming! Up, my boy! <lb n="1475" /></said> </p>
            <p>  Fleming stood up slowly. <lb n="1476" />
             <said who="Father Dolan">&#8213;Hold out! cried the prefect of studies. <lb n="1477" /></said> </p>
            <p>  Fleming held out his hand. The pandybat came down on it <lb n="1478" />
             with a loud smacking sound: one, two, three, four, five, six. <lb n="1479" />
             <said who="Father Dolan">&#8213;Other hand! <lb n="1480" /></said> </p>
            <p>  The pandybat came down again in six loud quick smacks. <lb n="1481" />
             <said who="Father Dolan">&#8213;Kneel down! cried the prefect of studies. <lb n="1482" /></said> </p>
            <p>  Fleming knelt down squeezing his hands under his armpits, <lb n="1483" />
             his face contorted with pain, but Stephen knew how hard his <lb n="1484" />
             hands were because Fleming was always rubbing rosin into <lb n="1485" />
             them. But perhaps he was in great pain for the noise of the <lb n="1486" />
             pandies was terrible. Stephen's heart was beating and flutter- <lb n="1487" />
             ing. <lb n="1488" />
             <said who="Father Dolan">&#8213;At your work, all of you! shouted the prefect of studies. We <lb n="1489" />
             want no lazy idle loafers here, lazy idle little schemers. At your <lb n="1490" />
             work, I tell you. Father Dolan will be in to see you every day. <lb n="1491" />
             Father Dolan will be in tomorrow. <lb n="1492" /></said> </p>
            <p>  He poked one of the boys in the side with the pandybat, <lb n="1493" />
             saying: <lb n="1494" />
             <said who="Father Dolan">&#8213;You, boy! When will Father Dolan be in again? <lb n="1495" /> </said>
             <said who="Tom Furlong">&#8213;Tomorrow, sir, said Tom Furlong's voice. <lb n="1496" /> </said>
             <said who="Father Dolan">&#8213;Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow, said the prefect of <lb n="1497" />
             studies. Make up your minds for that. Every day Father Dolan. <lb n="1498" />
             Write away. You, boy, who are you? <lb n="1499" /></said> </p>
            <p>  Stephen's heart jumped suddenly. <lb n="1500" />
             <said who="Stephen">&#8213;Dedalus, sir. <lb n="1501" /> </said>
             <said who="Father Dolan">&#8213;Why are you not writing like the others? <lb n="1502" /> </said>
             <said who="Stephen">&#8213;I ..... my ... <lb n="1503" /></said> </p>
            <p>  He could not speak with fright. <lb n="1504" />
             <said who="Father Dolan">&#8213;Why is he not writing, Father Arnall? <lb n="1505" /> </said>
             <said who="Father Arnall">&#8213;He broke his glasses, said Father Arnall, and I exempted him <lb n="1506" />
             from work. <lb n="1507" /> </said>
             <said who="Father Dolan">&#8213;Broke? What is this I hear? What is this your name is? said <lb n="1508" />
             the prefect of studies. <lb n="1509" /> </said>
             <said who="Stephen">&#8213;Dedalus, sir. <lb n="1510" /> </said>
             <said who="Father Dolan">&#8213;Out here, Dedalus. Lazy little schemer. I see schemer in your <lb n="1511" />
             face. Where did you break your glasses? <lb n="1512" /></said> </p>
            <p>  Stephen stumbled into the middle of the class, blinded by <lb n="1513" />
             fear and haste. <lb n="1514" />
             <said who="Father Dolan">&#8213;Where did you break your glasses? repeated the prefect of <lb n="1515" />
             studies. <lb n="1516" /> </said>
             <said who="Stephen">&#8213;The <seg type="neologism">cinderpath</seg>, sir. <lb n="1517" /> </said>
             <said who="Father Dolan">&#8213;Hoho! The <seg type="neologism">cinderpath</seg>! cried the prefect of studies. I know <lb n="1518" />
             that trick. <lb n="1519" /></said> </p>
            <p>  Stephen lifted his eyes in wonder and saw for a moment <lb n="1520" />
             Father Dolan's <seg type="neologism">whitegrey</seg> not young face, his baldy <seg type="neologism">whitegrey</seg> <lb n="1521" />
             head with fluff at the sides of it, the steel rims of his spectacles <lb n="1522" />
             and his <seg type="neologism">nocoloured</seg> eyes looking through the glasses. Why did <lb n="1523" />
             he say that he knew that trick? <lb n="1524" />
             <said who="Father Dolan">&#8213;Lazy idle little loafer! cried the prefect of studies. Broke my <lb n="1525" />
             glasses! An old schoolboy trick! Out with your hand this mo- <lb n="1526" />
             moment! <lb n="1527" /></said> </p>
            <p>  Stephen closed his eyes and held out in the air his trembling <lb n="1528" />
             hand with the palm upwards. He felt the prefect of studies <lb n="1529" />
             touch it for a moment at the fingers to straighten it and then <lb n="1530" />
             the swish of the sleeve of the soutane as the pandybat was lifted <lb n="1531" />
             to strike. A hot burning stinging tingling blow like the loud <lb n="1532" />
             crack of a broken stick made his trembling hand crumple to- <lb n="1533" />
             together like a leaf in the fire: and at the sound and the pain <lb n="1534" />
             scalding tears were driven into his eyes. His whole body was <lb n="1535" />
             shaking with fright, his arm was shaking and his crumpled <lb n="1536" />
             burning livid hand shook like a loose leaf in the air. A cry <lb n="1537" />
             sprang to his lips, a prayer to be let off. But though the tears <lb n="1538" />
             scalded his eyes and his limbs quivered with pain and fright he <lb n="1539" />
             held back the hot tears and the cry that scalded his throat. <lb n="1540" />
             <said who="Father Dolan">&#8213;Other hand! shouted the prefect of studies. <lb n="1541" /></said> </p>
            <p>  Stephen drew back his maimed and quivering right arm and <lb n="1542" />
             held out his left hand. The soutane sleeve swished again as the <lb n="1543" />
             pandybat was lifted and a loud crashing sound and a fierce <lb n="1544" />
             maddening tingling burning pain made his hand shrink to- <lb n="1545" />
             together with the palms and fingers in a livid quivering mass. The <lb n="1546" />
             scalding water burst forth from his eyes and, burning with <lb n="1547" />
             shame and agony and fear, he drew back his shaking arm in <lb n="1548" />
             terror and burst out into a whine of pain. His body shook with <lb n="1549" />
             a palsy of fright and in shame and rage he felt the scalding cry <lb n="1550" />
             come from his throat and the scalding tears falling out of his <lb n="1551" />
             eyes and down his flaming cheeks. <lb n="1552" />
             <said who="Father Dolan">&#8213;Kneel down! cried the prefect of studies. <lb n="1553" /></said> </p>
            <p>  Stephen knelt down quickly pressing his beaten hands to his <lb n="1554" />
             sides. To think of them  beaten and swollen with pain all in a <lb n="1555" />
             moment made him feel so sorry for them as if they were not his <lb n="1556" />
             own but someone else's that he felt so sorry for. And as he <lb n="1557" />
             knelt, calming the last sobs in his throat and feeling the burning <lb n="1558" />
             tingling pain pressed in to his sides, he thought of the hands <lb n="1559" />
             which he had held out in the air with the palms up and of the <lb n="1560" />
             firm touch of the prefect of studies when he had steadied the <lb n="1561" />
             shaking fingers and of the beaten swollen reddened mass of <lb n="1562" />
             palm and fingers that shook helplessly  in the air. <lb n="1563" />
             <said who="Father Dolan">&#8213;Get at your work, all of you, cried the prefect of studies <lb n="1564" />
             from the door. Father Dolan will be in every day to see if any <lb n="1565" />
             boy, any lazy idle little loafer wants flogging. Every day. Every <lb n="1566" />
             day. <lb n="1567" /></said> </p>
            <p>  The door closed behind him.<lb n="1568" /> </p>
            <p>  The hushed class continued to copy out the themes. Father <lb n="1569" />
             Arnall rose from his seat and went among them, helping the <lb n="1570" />
             boys with gentle words and telling them the mistakes they had <lb n="1571" />
             made. His voice was very gentle and soft. Then he returned to <lb n="1572" />
             his seat and said to Fleming and Stephen: <lb n="1573" />
             <said who="Father Arnall">&#8213;You may return to your places, you two. <lb n="1574" /></said> </p>
            <p>  Fleming and Stephen rose and, walking to their seats, sat <lb n="1575" />
             down. Stephen, scarlet with shame, opened a book quickly <lb n="1576" />
             with one weak hand and bent down upon it, his face close to <lb n="1577" />
             the page.<lb n="1578" /> </p>
            <p>  It was unfair and cruel: because the doctor had told him not <lb n="1579" />
             to read without glasses and he had written home to his father <lb n="1580" />
             that morning to send him a new pair. And Father Arnall had <lb n="1581" />
             said that he need not study till the new glasses came. Then to <lb n="1582" />
             be called a schemer before the class and to be pandied when he <lb n="1583" />
             always got the card for first or second and was the leader of the <lb n="1584" />
             Yorkists! How could the prefect of studies know that it was a <lb n="1585" />
             trick? He felt the touch of the prefect's fingers as they had <lb n="1586" />
             steadied his hand and at first he had thought that he was going <lb n="1587" />
             to shake hands with him because the fingers were soft and firm: <lb n="1588" />
             but then in an instant he had heard the swish of the soutane <lb n="1589" />
             sleeve and the crash. It was cruel and unfair to make him kneel <lb n="1590" />
             in the middle of the class then: and Father Arnall had told them <lb n="1591" />
             both that they might return to their places without making any <lb n="1592" />
             difference between them. He listened to Father Arnall's low <lb n="1593" />
             and gentle voice as he corrected the themes. Perhaps he was <lb n="1594" />
             sorry now and wanted to be decent. But it was unfair and cruel. <lb n="1595" />
             The prefect of studies was a priest but that was cruel and <lb n="1596" />
             unfair. And his <seg type="neologism">whitegrey</seg> face and the <seg type="neologism">nocoloured</seg> eyes behind <lb n="1597" />
             the <seg type="neologism">steelrimmed</seg> spectacles were cruel looking because he had <lb n="1598" />
             steadied the hand first with his firm soft fingers and that was to <lb n="1599" />
             hit it better and louder. <lb n="1600" />
             <said who="Fleming">&#8213;It's a stinking mean thing, that's what it is, said Fleming in <lb n="1601" />
             the corridor as the classes were passing out in file to the refec- <lb n="1602" />
             tory, to pandy a fellow for what is not his fault. <lb n="1603" /> </said>
             <said who="Nasty Roche">&#8213;You really broke your glasses by accident, didn't you? Nasty <lb n="1604" />
             Roche asked. <lb n="1605" /></said> </p>
            <p>  Stephen felt his heart filled by Fleming's words and did not <lb n="1606" />
             answer. <lb n="1607" />
             <said who="Fleming">&#8213;Of course he did! said Fleming. I wouldn't stand it. I'd go up <lb n="1608" />
             and tell the rector on him. <lb n="1609" /> </said>
             <said who="Cecil Thunder">&#8213;Yes, said Cecil Thunder eagerly, and I saw him lift the <lb n="1610" />
             pandybat over his shoulder and he's not allowed to do that. <lb n="1611" /> </said>
             <said who="Nasty Roche">&#8213;Did they hurt much? Nasty Roche asked. <lb n="1612" /> </said>
             <said who="Stephen">&#8213;Very much, Stephen said. <lb n="1613" /> </said>
             <said who="Fleming">&#8213;I wouldn't stand it, Fleming repeated, from Baldyhead or <lb n="1614" />
             any other Baldyhead. It's a stinking mean low trick, that's what <lb n="1615" />
             it is. I'd go up straight up to the rector and tell him about it <lb n="1616" />
             after dinner. <lb n="1617" /> </said>
             <said who="Cecil Thunder">&#8213;Yes, do. Yes, do, said Cecil Thunder. <lb n="1618" /> </said>
             <said who="Nasty Roche">&#8213;Yes, do. Yes, go up and tell the rector on him, Dedalus, said <lb n="1619" />
             Nasty Roche, because he said that he'd come in tomorrow <lb n="1620" />
             again to pandy you. <lb n="1621" /> </said>
             <said who="all">&#8213;Yes, yes. Tell the rector, all said. <lb n="1622" /></said> </p>
            <p>  And there were some fellows out of second of grammar lis- <lb n="1623" />
             listening and one of them said: <lb n="1624" />
             <said who="some fellows out of second of grammar">&#8213;The senate and the Roman people declared that Dedalus had <lb n="1625" />
             been wrongly punished. <lb n="1626" /></said> </p>
            <p>  It was wrong; it was unfair and cruel: and, as he sat in the <lb n="1627" />
             refectory, he suffered time after time in memory the same hu- <lb n="1628" />
             humiliation until he began to wonder whether it might not really <lb n="1629" />
             be that there was something in his face which made him look <lb n="1630" />
             like a schemer and he wished he had a little mirror to see. But <lb n="1631" />
             there could not be; and it was unjust and cruel and unfair.<lb n="1632" /> </p>
            <p>  He could not eat the blackish fish fritters they got on <lb n="1633" />
             Wednesdays in lent and one of his potatoes had the mark of the <lb n="1634" />
             spade in it. Yes, he would do what the fellows had told him. He <lb n="1635" />
             would go up and tell the rector that he had been wrongly <lb n="1636" />
             punished. A thing like that had been done before by somebody <lb n="1637" />
             in history, by some great person whose head was in the books <lb n="1638" />
             of history. And the rector would declare that he had been <lb n="1639" />
             wrongly punished because the senate and the Roman people <lb n="1640" />
             always declared that the man who did that had been wrongly <lb n="1641" />
             punished. Those were the great men whose names were in <lb n="1642" />
             Richmal Magnall's Questions. History was all about those men <lb n="1643" />
             and what they did and that was what Peter Parley's Tales about <lb n="1644" />
             Greece and Rome were all about. Peter Parley himself was on <lb n="1645" />
             the first page in a picture. There was a road over a heath with <lb n="1646" />
             grass at the side and little bushes: and Peter Parley had a broad <lb n="1647" />
             hat like a protestant minister and a big stick and he was walk- <lb n="1648" />
             ing fast along the road to <place><location><geo>39.074208 21.824312</geo></location><placeName>Greece</placeName></place> and <lb n="1649" />
            <place><location><geo>41.902783 12.496366</geo></location><placeName>Rome</placeName></place>.</p>
            <p>  It was easy what he had to do. All he had to do  was when <lb n="1650" />
             the dinner was over and he came out in his turn to go on <lb n="1651" />
             walking but not out to the corridor but up the staircase on the <lb n="1652" />
             right that led to the castle. He had nothing to do but that: to <lb n="1653" />
             turn to the right and walk fast up the staircase and in half a <lb n="1654" />
             minute he would be in the low dark narrow corridor that led <lb n="1655" />
             through the castle to the rector's room. And every fellow had <lb n="1656" />
             said that it was unfair, even the fellow out of second of gram- <lb n="1657" />
             mar who had said that about the senate and the Roman people.<lb n="1658" /> </p>
            <p>  What would happen? He heard the fellows of the higher line <lb n="1659" />
             stand up at the top of the refectory and heard their steps as <lb n="1660" />
             they came down the matting: Paddy Rath and Jimmy Magee <lb n="1661" />
             and the Spaniard and the Portuguese and the fifth was big <lb n="1662" />
             Corrigan who was going to be flogged by Mr Gleeson. That <lb n="1663" />
             was why the prefect of studies had called him a schemer and <lb n="1664" />
             pandied him for nothing: and, straining his weak eyes, tired <lb n="1665" />
             with the tears, he watched big Corrigan's broad shoulders and <lb n="1666" />
             big hanging black head passing in the file. But he had done <lb n="1667" />
             something and besides Mr Gleeson would not flog him hard: <lb n="1668" />
             and he remembered how big Corrigan looked in the bath. He <lb n="1669" />
             had skin the same colour as the <seg type="neologism">turfcoloured</seg> bogwater in the <lb n="1670" />
             shallow end of the bath and when he walked along the side his <lb n="1671" />
             feet slapped loudly on the wet tiles and at every step his thighs <lb n="1672" />
             shook a little because he was fat.<lb n="1673" /> </p>
            <p>  The refectory was half empty and the fellows were still <lb n="1674" />
             passing out in file. He could go up the staircase because there <lb n="1675" />
             was never a priest or a prefect outside the refectory door. But <lb n="1676" />
             he could not go. The rector would side with the prefect of <lb n="1677" />
             studies and think it was a schoolboy trick and then the prefect <lb n="1678" />
             of studies would come in every day the same only it would be <lb n="1679" />
             worse because he would be dreadfully waxy at any fellow <lb n="1680" />
             going up to the rector about him. The fellows had told him to <lb n="1681" />
             go but they would not go themselves. They had forgotten all <lb n="1682" />
             about it. No, it was best to forget all about it: and perhaps the <lb n="1683" />
             prefect of studies had only said he would come in. No, it was <lb n="1684" />
             best to hide out of the way because when you were small and <lb n="1685" />
             young you could often escape that way.<lb n="1686" /> </p>
            <p>  The fellows at his table stood up. He stood up and passed <lb n="1687" />
             out among them in the file. He had to decide. He was coming <lb n="1688" />
             near the door. If he went on with the fellows he could never go <lb n="1689" />
             up to the rector because he could not leave the playground for <lb n="1690" />
             that. And if he went and was pandied all the same all the <lb n="1691" />
             fellows would make fun and talk about young Dedalus going <lb n="1692" />
             up to the rector to tell on the prefect of studies.<lb n="1693" /> </p>
            <p>  He was walking down along the matting and he saw the <lb n="1694" />
             door before him. It was impossible: he could not. He thought <lb n="1695" />
             of the baldy head of the prefect of studies with the cruel no- <lb n="1696" />
             <seg type="neologism">nocoloured</seg> eyes looking at him and he heard the voice of the <lb n="1697" />
             prefect of studies asking him twice what his name was. Why <lb n="1698" />
             could he not remember the name when he was told the first <lb n="1699" />
             time? Was he not listening the first time or was it to make fun <lb n="1700" />
             out of the name? The great men in the history had names like <lb n="1701" />
             that and nobody made fun of them. It was his own name that <lb n="1702" />
             he should have made fun of if he wanted to make fun. Dolan: it <lb n="1703" />
             was like the name of a woman that washed clothes.<lb n="1704" /> </p>
            <p>  He had reached the door and, turning quickly  to the right, <lb n="1705" />
             walked up the stairs: and, before he could make up his mind to <lb n="1706" />
             come back, he had entered the low dark narrow corridor that <lb n="1707" />
             led to the castle. And as he crossed the threshold of the door of <lb n="1708" />
             the corridor  he saw, without turning his head to look, that all <lb n="1709" />
             the fellows were looking after him as they went filing by.<lb n="1710" /> </p>
            <p>  He passed along the narrow dark corridor, passing little <lb n="1711" />
             doors that were the doors of the rooms of the community. He <lb n="1712" />
             peered in front of him and right and left through the gloom and <lb n="1713" />
             thought that those must be portraits. It was dark and silent and <lb n="1714" />
             his eyes were weak and tired with tears so that he could not <lb n="1715" />
             see. But he thought they were the portraits of the saints and <lb n="1716" />
             great men of the order who were looking down on him silently <lb n="1717" />
             as he passed: saint Ignatius Loyola holding an open book and <lb n="1718" />
             pointing to the words <seg xml:lang="la">Ad Majorem Dei Gloriam</seg> in it, saint <lb n="1719" />
             Francis Xavier pointing to his chest, Lorenzo Ricci with his <lb n="1720" />
             berretta on his head like one of the prefects of the lines, the <lb n="1721" />
             three patrons of holy youth, saint Stanislaus Kostka, saint <lb n="1722" />
             Aloysius Gonzaga and blessed John Berchmans, all with young <lb n="1723" />
             faces because they died when they were young, and Father <lb n="1724" />
             Peter Kenny sitting in a chair wrapped in a big cloak.<lb n="1725" /> </p>
            <p>  He came out on the landing above the entrance hall and <lb n="1726" />
             looked about him. That was where Hamilton Rowan had <lb n="1727" />
             passed and the marks of the soldiers' slugs were there. And it <lb n="1728" />
             was there that the old servants had seen the ghost in the white <lb n="1729" />
             cloak of a marshal.<lb n="1730" /> </p>
            <p>  An old servant was sweeping at the end of the landing. He <lb n="1731" />
             asked him where was the rector's room and the old servant <lb n="1732" />
             pointed to the door at the far end and looked after him as he <lb n="1733" />
             went on to it and knocked.<lb n="1734" /> </p>
            <p>  There was no answer. He knocked again more loudly and <lb n="1735" />
             his heart jumped when he heard a muffled voice say: <lb n="1736" />
             <said who="the rector">&#8213;Come in! <lb n="1737" /></said> </p>
            <p>  He turned the handle and opened the door and fumbled for <lb n="1738" />
             the handle of the green baize door inside. He found it and <lb n="1739" />
             pushed it open and went in.<lb n="1740" /> </p>
            <p>  He saw the rector sitting at a desk writing. There was a skull <lb n="1741" />
             on the desk and a strange solemn smell in the room like the old <lb n="1742" />
             leather of chairs.<lb n="1743" /> </p>
            <p>  His heart was beating fast on account of the solemn place he <lb n="1744" />
             was in and the silence of the room:  and he looked at the skull <lb n="1745" />
             and at the rector's <seg type="neologism">kindlooking</seg> face. <lb n="1746" />
             <said who="the rector">&#8213;Well, my little man, said the rector. What is it? <lb n="1747" /></said> </p>
            <p>  Stephen swallowed down the thing in his throat and said: <lb n="1748" />
             <said who="Stephen">&#8213;I broke my glasses, sir. <lb n="1749" /></said> </p>
            <p>  The rector opened his mouth and said: <lb n="1750" />
             <said who="the rector">&#8213;O! <lb n="1751" /></said> </p>
            <p>  Then he smiled and said: <lb n="1752" />
             <said who="the rector">&#8213;Well, if we broke our glasses we must write home for a new <lb n="1753" />
             pair. <lb n="1754" /> </said>
             <said who="Stephen">&#8213;I wrote home, sir, said Stephen, and Father Arnall said I am <lb n="1755" />
             not to study till they come. <lb n="1756" /> </said>
             <said who="the rector">&#8213;Quite right! said the rector. <lb n="1757" /></said> </p>
            <p>  Stephen swallowed down the thing again  and tried to keep <lb n="1758" />
             his legs and his voice from shaking. <lb n="1759" />
             <said who="Stephen">&#8213;But, sir .... <lb n="1760" /> </said>
             <said who="the rector">&#8213;Yes? <lb n="1761" /> </said>
             <said who="Stephen">&#8213;Father Dolan came in today and pandied me because I was <lb n="1762" />
             not writing my theme. <lb n="1763" /></said> </p>
            <p>  The rector looked at him in silence and he could feel the <lb n="1764" />
             blood rising to his face and the tears about to rise to his eyes.<lb n="1765" /> </p>
            <p>  The rector said: <lb n="1766" />
             <said who="the rector">&#8213;Your name is Dedalus, isn't it? <lb n="1767" /> </said>
             <said who="Stephen">&#8213;Yes, sir. <lb n="1768" /> </said>
             <said who="the rector">&#8213;And where did you break your glasses? <lb n="1769" /> </said>
             <said who="Stephen">&#8213;On the <seg type="neologism">cinderpath</seg>, sir. A fellow was coming out of the <lb n="1770" />
             bicycle house and I fell and they got broken. I don't know the <lb n="1771" />
             fellow's name. <lb n="1772" /></said> </p>
            <p>  The rector looked at him again in silence. Then he smiled <lb n="1773" />
             and said: <lb n="1774" />
             <said who="the rector">&#8213;O, well, it was a mistake. I am sure Father Dolan did not <lb n="1775" />
             know. <lb n="1776" /> </said>
             <said who="Stephen">&#8213;But I told him I broke them, sir, and he pandied me. <lb n="1777" /> </said>
             <said who="the rector">&#8213;Did you tell him that you had written home for a new pair? <lb n="1778" />
             the rector asked. <lb n="1779" /> </said>
             <said who="Stephen">&#8213;No, sir. <lb n="1780" /> </said>
             <said who="the rector">&#8213;O well then, said the rector, Father Dolan did not under- <lb n="1781" />
             stand. You can say that I excuse you from your lessons for a <lb n="1782" />
             few days. <lb n="1783" /></said> </p>
            <p>  Stephen said quickly for fear his trembling would prevent <lb n="1784" />
             him: <lb n="1785" />
             <said who="Stephen">&#8213;Yes, sir, but Father Dolan said he will come in tomorrow to <lb n="1786" />
             pandy me again for it. <lb n="1787" /> </said>
             <said who="the rector">&#8213;Very well, the rector said. It is a mistake and I shall speak to <lb n="1788" />
             Father Dolan myself. Will that do now? <lb n="1789" /></said> </p>
            <p>  Stephen felt the tears wetting his eyes and murmured: <lb n="1790" />
             <said who="Stephen">&#8213;O yes, sir, thanks. <lb n="1791" /></said> </p>
            <p>  The rector held his hand across the side of the desk where <lb n="1792" />
             the skull was and Stephen, placing his hand in it for a moment, <lb n="1793" />
             felt a cool moist palm. <lb n="1794" />
             <said who="the rector">&#8213;Good day now, said the rector, withdrawing his hand and <lb n="1795" />
             bowing. <lb n="1796" /> </said>
             <said who="Stephen">&#8213;Good day, sir, said Stephen. <lb n="1797" /></said> </p>
            <p>  He bowed and walked quietly out of the room, closing the <lb n="1798" />
             doors carefully and slowly.<lb n="1799" /> </p>
            <p>  But when he had passed the old servant on the landing and <lb n="1800" />
             was again in the low narrow dark corridor he began to walk <lb n="1801" />
             faster and faster. Faster and faster he hurried on through the <lb n="1802" />
             gloom, excitedly. He bumped his elbow against the door at the <lb n="1803" />
             end and, hurrying down the staircase, walked quickly through <lb n="1804" />
             the two corridors and out into the air.<lb n="1805" /> </p>
            <p>  He could hear the cries of the fellows on the playgrounds. <lb n="1806" />
             He broke into a run and, running quicker and quicker, ran <lb n="1807" />
             across the <seg type="neologism">cinderpath</seg> and reached the third line playground, <lb n="1808" />
             panting.<lb n="1809" /> </p>
            <p>  The fellows had seen him running. They closed round him in <lb n="1810" />
             a ring, pushing one against another to hear. <lb n="1811" />
             <said who="the fellows">&#8213;Tell us! Tell us! <lb n="1812" /> </said>
             <said who="the fellows">&#8213;What did he say? <lb n="1813" /> </said>
             <said who="the fellows">&#8213;Did you go in? <lb n="1814" /> </said>
             <said who="the fellows">&#8213;What did he say? <lb n="1815" /> </said>
             <said who="the fellows">&#8213;Tell us! Tell us! <lb n="1816" /></said> </p>
            <p>  He told them what he had said and what the rector had said <lb n="1817" />
             and, when he had told them, all the fellows flung their caps <lb n="1818" />
             spinning up into the air and cried: <lb n="1819" />
             <said who="the fellows">&#8213;Hurroo! <lb n="1820" /></said> </p>
            <p>  They caught their caps and sent them up again spinning <lb n="1821" />
             <seg type="neologism">skyhigh</seg> and cried again: <lb n="1822" />
             <said who="the fellows">&#8213;Hurroo! Hurroo! <lb n="1823" /></said> </p>
            <p>  They made a cradle of their locked hands and hoisted him <lb n="1824" />
             up among them and carried him along till he struggled to get <lb n="1825" />
             free. And when he had escaped from them they broke away in <lb n="1826" />
             all directions, flinging their caps again into the air and whis- <lb n="1827" />
             tling as they went spinning up and crying: <lb n="1828" />
             <said who="the fellows">&#8213;Hurroo! <lb n="1829" /></said> </p>
            <p>  And they gave three groans for Baldyhead Dolan and three <lb n="1830" />
             cheers for Conmee and they said he was the decentest rector <lb n="1831" />
             that was ever in Clongowes.<lb n="1832" /> </p>
            <p>  The cheers died away in the soft grey air. He was alone. He <lb n="1833" />
             was happy and free: but he would not be anyway proud with <lb n="1834" />
             Father Dolan. He would be very quiet and obedient: and he <lb n="1835" />
             wished that he could do something kind for him to show him <lb n="1836" />
             that he was not proud.<lb n="1837" /> </p>
            <p>  The air was soft and grey and mild and evening was coming. <lb n="1838" />
             There was the smell of evening in the air, the smell of the fields <lb n="1839" />
             in the country where they digged up turnips to peel them and <lb n="1840" />
             eat them when they went out for a walk to <place><location><geo>53.257926 -6.585225</geo></location><placeName>Major Barton's</placeName></place>, the <lb n="1841" />
             smell there was in the little wood beyond the pavilion where <lb n="1842" />
             the gallnuts were.<lb n="1843" /> </p>
            <p>  The fellows were practising long shies and bowling lobs and <lb n="1844" />
             slow twisters. In the soft grey silence he could hear the bump of <lb n="1845" />
             the balls: and from here and from there through the quiet air <lb n="1846" />
             the sound of the cricket bats: pick, pack, pock, puck: like drops <lb n="1847" />
             of water in a fountain falling softly in the brimming bowl.<lb n="1848" /> </p>

          <p>  Uncle Charles smoked such black twist that at last his out- <lb n="1" />
          spoken nephew suggested to him to enjoy his morning smoke <lb n="2" />
          in a little outhouse at the end of the garden. <lb n="3" />
           <said who="Uncle Charles">&#8213;Very good, Simon. All serene, Simon, said the old man tran- <lb n="4" />
          quilly. Anywhere you like. The outhouse will do me nicely: it <lb n="5" />
          will be more salubrious.<lb n="6" /> </said>
           <said who="Simon Dedalus">&#8213;Damn me, said Mr Dedalus frankly, if I know how you can <lb n="7" />
          smoke such villainous awful tobacco. It's like gunpowder, by <lb n="8" />
          God.<lb n="9" /> </said>
           <said who="Uncle Charles">&#8213;It's very nice, Simon, replied the old man. Very cool and <lb n="10" />
          mollifying.<lb n="11" /></said> </p>
          <p>  Every morning, therefore, uncle Charles repaired to his out- <lb n="12" />
          house but not before he had creased and brushed scrupulously <lb n="13" />
          his back hair and brushed and put on his tall hat. While he <lb n="14" />
          smoked the brim of his tall hat and the bowl of his pipe were <lb n="15" />
          just visible beyond the jambs of the outhouse door. His arbour, <lb n="16" />
          as he called the reeking outhouse which he shared with the cat <lb n="17" />
          and the garden tools, served him also as a soundingbox: and <lb n="18" />
          every morning he hummed contentedly one of his favourite <lb n="19" />
          songs: <emph>O, twine me a bower</emph> or <emph>Blue eyes and golden hair</emph> or <lb n="20" />
          <emph>The Groves of Blarney</emph> while the grey and blue coils of smoke <lb n="21" />
          rose slowly from his pipe and vanished in the pure air.<lb n="22" /> </p>
          <p>  During the first part of the summer in Blackrock uncle <lb n="23" />
          Charles was Stephen's constant companion. Uncle Charles was <lb n="24" />
          a hale old man with a well tanned skin, rugged features and <lb n="25" />
          white side whiskers. On week days he did messages between <lb n="26" />
          the house in <place><location><geo>53.293248, -6.180109</geo></location><placeName>Carysfort Avenue</placeName></place> and those shops in the main <lb n="27" />
          street of the town with which the family dealt. Stephen was <lb n="28" />
          glad to go with him on these errands for uncle Charles helped <lb n="29" />
          him very liberally to handfuls of whatever was exposed in open <lb n="30" />
          boxes and barrels outside the counter. He would seize a hand- <lb n="31" />
          ful of grapes and sawdust or three or four American apples and <lb n="32" />
          thrust them generously into his grandnephew's hand while the <lb n="33" />
          shopman smiled uneasily; and on Stephen's feigning reluctance <lb n="34" />
          to take them, he would frown and say: <lb n="35" />
           <said who="Uncle Charles">&#8213;Take them, sir. Do you hear me, sir? They're good for your <lb n="36" />
          bowels.<lb n="37" /></said> </p>
          <p>  When the order list had been booked the two would go on <lb n="38" />
          to the park where an old friend of Stephen's father, Mike <lb n="39" />
          Flynn, would be found seated on a bench, waiting for them. <lb n="40" />
          Then would begin Stephen's run round the park. Mike Flynn <lb n="41" />
          would stand at the gate near the railway station, watch in <lb n="42" />
          hand, while Stephen ran round the track in the style Mike <lb n="43" />
          Flynn favoured, his head high lifted, his knees well lifted and <lb n="44" />
          his hands held straight down by his sides. When the morning <lb n="45" />
          practice was over the trainer would make his comments and <lb n="46" />
          sometimes illustrate them by shuffling along for a yard or so <lb n="47" />
          comically in an old pair of blue canvas shoes. A small ring of <lb n="48" />
          wonderstruck children and nursemaids would gather to watch <lb n="49" />
          him and linger even when he and uncle Charles had sat down <lb n="50" />
          again and were talking athletics and politics. Though he had <lb n="51" />
          heard his father say that Mike Flynn had put some of the best <lb n="52" />
          runners of modern times through his hands Stephen often <lb n="53" />
          glanced with mistrust at his trainer's flabby stubblecovered <lb n="54" />
          face, as it bent over the long stained fingers through which he <lb n="55" />
          rolled his cigarette, and with pity at the mild lustreless blue <lb n="56" />
          eyes which would look up suddenly from the task and gaze <lb n="57" />
          vaguely into the bluer distance while the long swollen fingers <lb n="58" />
          ceased their rolling and grains and fibres of tobacco fell back <lb n="59" />
          into the pouch.<lb n="60" /> </p>
          <p>  On the way home uncle Charles would often pay a visit to <lb n="61" />
          the chapel and, as the font was above Stephen's reach, the old <lb n="62" />
          man would dip his hand and then sprinkle the water briskly <lb n="63" />
          about Stephen's clothes and on the floor of the porch. While he <lb n="64" />
          prayed he knelt on his red handkerchief and read above his <lb n="65" />
          breath from a thumbblackened prayerbook wherein catch- <lb n="66" />
          words were printed at the foot of every page. Stephen knelt at <lb n="67" />
          his side respecting, though he did not share, his piety. He often <lb n="68" />
          wondered what his granduncle prayed for so seriously. Perhaps <lb n="69" />
          he prayed for the souls in purgatory or for the grace of a happy <lb n="70" />
          death: or perhaps he prayed that God might send him back a <lb n="71" />
          part of the big fortune he had squandered in Cork.<lb n="72" /> </p>
          <p>  On Sundays Stephen with his father and his granduncle took <lb n="73" />
          their constitutional. The old man was a nimble walker in spite <lb n="74" />
          of his corns and often ten or twelve miles of the road were <lb n="75" />
          covered. The little village of <place><location><geo>53.287857, -6.203573</geo></location><placeName>Stillorgan</placeName></place> was the parting of the <lb n="76" />
          ways. Either they went to the left towards the Dublin moun- <lb n="77" />
          tains or along the <place><location><geo>53.297702, -6.233964</geo></location><placeName>Goatstown road</placeName></place> and thence <lb n="78" />
          into <place><location><geo>53.289154, -6.243264</geo></location><placeName>Dundrum</placeName></place>,
          coming home by  <place><location><geo>53.269979, -6.224923</geo></location><placeName>Sandyford</placeName></place>. Trudging along the road or <lb n="79" />
          standing in some grimy wayside publichouse his elders spoke <lb n="80" />
          constantly of the subjects nearest their hearts, of Irish politics, <lb n="81" />
          of Munster and of the legends of their own family, to all of <lb n="82" />
          which Stephen lent an avid ear. Words which he did not under- <lb n="83" />
          stand he said over and over to himself till he had learned them <lb n="84" />
          by heart: and through them he had glimpses of the real world <lb n="85" />
          about him. The hour when he too would take his part in the <lb n="86" />
          life of that world seemed drawing near and in secret he began <lb n="87" />
          to make ready for the great part which he felt awaited him the <lb n="88" />
          nature of which he only dimly apprehended.<lb n="89" /> </p>
          <p>  His evenings were his own; and he pored over a ragged <lb n="90" />
          translation of <emph>The Count of Monte Cristo</emph>. The figure of that <lb n="91" />
          dark avenger stood forth in his mind for whatever he had heard <lb n="92" />
          or divined in childhood of the strange and terrible. At night he <lb n="93" />
          built up on the parlour table an image of the wonderful island <lb n="94" />
          cave out of transfers and paper flowers and coloured tissue <lb n="95" />
          paper and strips of the silver and golden paper in which choc- <lb n="96" />
          olate is wrapped. When he had broken up this scenery, weary <lb n="97" />
          of its tinsel, there would come to his mind the bright picture of <lb n="98" />
           <place><location><geo>43.295207, <lb n="99" />
          5.364077</geo></location><placeName>Marseilles</placeName></place>, of sunny trellisses and of Mercedes. Outside <place><location><geo>53.300907,
          -6.177049</geo></location><placeName>Black-
           rock</placeName></place>, on the road that led to the mountains, stood a small <lb n="100" />
          whitewashed house in the garden of which grew many rose- <lb n="101" />
          bushes: and in this house, he told himself, another Mercedes <lb n="102" />
          lived. Both on the outward and on the homeward journey he <lb n="103" />
          measured distance by this landmark: and in his imagination he <lb n="104" />
          lived through a long train of adventures, marvellous as those in <lb n="105" />
          the book itself, towards the close of which there appeared an <lb n="106" />
          image of himself, grown older and sadder, standing in a <lb n="107" />
          moonlit garden with Mercedes who had so many years before <lb n="108" />
          slighted his love, and with a sadly proud gesture of refusal, <lb n="109" />
          saying: <lb n="110" />
           <said who="Count of Monte Cristo">&#8213;Madam, I never eat muscatel grapes.<lb n="111" /></said> </p>
          <p>  He became the ally of a boy named Aubrey Mills and <lb n="112" />
          founded with him a gang of adventurers in the avenue. Aubrey <lb n="113" />
          carried a whistle dangling from his buttonhole and a bicycle <lb n="114" />
          lamp attached to his belt while the others had short sticks <lb n="115" />
          thrust daggerwise through theirs. Stephen, who had read of <lb n="116" />
          Napoleon's plain style of dress, chose to remain unadorned and <lb n="117" />
          thereby heightened for himself the pleasure of taking counsel <lb n="118" />
          with his lieutenant before giving orders. The gang made forays <lb n="119" />
          into the gardens of old maids or went down to the castle and <lb n="120" />
          fought a battle on the shaggy weedgrown rocks, coming home <lb n="121" />
          after it weary stragglers with the stale odours of the foreshore <lb n="122" />
          in their nostrils and the rank oils of the seawrack upon their <lb n="123" />
          hands and in their hair.<lb n="124" /> </p>
          <p>  Aubrey and Stephen had a common milkman and often they <lb n="125" />
          drove out in the milkcar to <place><location><geo>53.250224, -6.179926</geo></location><placeName>Carrickmines</placeName></place> where the cows were <lb n="126" />
          at grass. While the men were milking the boys would take turns <lb n="127" />
          in riding the tractable mare round the field. But when autumn <lb n="128" />
          came the cows were driven home from the grass: and the first <lb n="129" />
          sight of the filthy cowyard at <place><location><geo>53.300791 -6.177067</geo></location><placeName>Stradbrook</placeName></place> with its foul green <lb n="130" />
          puddles and clots of liquid dung and steaming brantroughs <lb n="131" />
          sickened Stephen's heart. The cattle which had seemed so beau- <lb n="132" />
          tiful in the country on sunny days revolted him and he could <lb n="133" />
          not even look at the milk they yielded.<lb n="134" /> </p>
          <p>  The coming of September did not trouble him this year for <lb n="135" />
          he knew he was not to be sent back to <place><location><geo>53.310770, -6.684719</geo></location><placeName>Clongowes</placeName></place>. The practice <lb n="136" />
          in the park came to an end when Mike Flynn went into hospi- <lb n="137" />
          tal. Aubrey was at school and had only an hour or two free in <lb n="138" />
          the evening. The gang fell asunder and there were no more <lb n="139" />
          nightly forays or battles on the rocks. Stephen sometimes went <lb n="140" />
          round with the car which delivered the evening milk: and these <lb n="141" />
          chilly drives blew away his memory of the filth of the cowyard <lb n="142" />
          and he felt no repugnance at seeing the cowhairs and hayseeds <lb n="143" />
          on the milkman's coat. Whenever the car drew up before a <lb n="144" />
          house he waited to catch a glimpse of a well scrubbed kitchen <lb n="145" />
          or of a softly lighted hall and to see how the servant would <lb n="146" />
          hold the jug and how she would close the door. He thought it <lb n="147" />
          should be a pleasant life enough, driving along the roads every <lb n="148" />
          evening to deliver milk, if he had warm gloves and a fat bag of <lb n="149" />
          gingernuts in his pocket to eat from. But the same foreknowl- <lb n="150" />
          edge which had sickened his heart and made his limbs sag <lb n="151" />
          suddenly as he raced round the park, the same intuition which <lb n="152" />
          had made him glance with mistrust at his trainer's flabby <lb n="153" />
          stubblecovered face as it bent heavily over his long stained <lb n="154" />
          fingers, dissipated any vision of the future. In a vague way he <lb n="155" />
          understood that his father was in trouble and that this was the <lb n="156" />
          reason why he himself had not been sent back to <place><location><geo>53.310770, -6.684719</geo></location><placeName>Clongowes</placeName></place>. <lb n="157" />
          For some time he had felt the slight changes in his house; and <lb n="158" />
          these changes in what he had deemed unchangeable were so <lb n="159" />
          many slight shocks to his boyish conception of the world. The <lb n="160" />
          ambition which he felt astir at times in the darkness of his soul <lb n="161" />
          sought no outlet. A dusk like that of the outer world obscured <lb n="162" />
          his mind as he heard the mare's hoofs clattering along the <lb n="163" />
          tramtrack on the Rock Road and the great can swaying and <lb n="164" />
          rattling behind him.<lb n="165" /> </p>
          <p>  He returned to Mercedes and, as he brooded upon her im- <lb n="166" />
          age, a strange unrest crept into his blood. Sometimes a fever <lb n="167" />
          gathered within him and led him to rove alone in the evening <lb n="168" />
          along the quiet avenues. The peace of the gardens and the <lb n="169" />
          kindly lights in the windows poured a tender influence into his <lb n="170" />
          restless heart. The noise of children at play annoyed him and <lb n="171" />
          their silly voices made him feel, even more keenly than he had <lb n="172" />
          felt at <place><location><geo>53.310770, -6.684719</geo></location><placeName>Clongowes</placeName></place>, that he was different from others. He did <lb n="173" />
          not want to play. He wanted to meet in the real world the <lb n="174" />
          unsubstantial image which his soul so constantly beheld. He <lb n="175" />
          did not know where to seek it or how: but a premonition which <lb n="176" />
          led him on told him that this image would, without any overt <lb n="177" />
          act of his, encounter him. They would meet quietly as if they <lb n="178" />
          had known each other and had made their tryst, perhaps at one <lb n="179" />
          of the gates or in some more secret place. They would be alone, <lb n="180" />
          surrounded by darkness and silence: and in that moment of <lb n="181" />
          supreme tenderness he would be transfigured. He would fade <lb n="182" />
          into something impalpable under her eyes and then, in a mo- <lb n="183" />
          ment, he would be transfigured. Weakness and timidity and <lb n="184" />
          inexperience would fall from him in that magic moment.<lb n="185" /> </p>

        <div n="2.2" type="section">
          <p>   Two great yellow caravans had halted one morning before <lb n="186" />
          the door and men had come tramping into the house to dis- <lb n="187" />
          mantle it. The furniture had been hustled out through the front <lb n="188" />
          garden which was strewn with wisps of straw and rope ends <lb n="189" />
          and into the huge vans at the gate. When all had been safely <lb n="190" />
          stowed the vans had set off noisily down the avenue: and from <lb n="191" />
          the window of the railway carriage, in which he had sat with <lb n="192" />
          his redeyed mother, Stephen had seen them lumbering heavily <lb n="193" />
          along the Merrion Road.<lb n="194" /> </p>
          <p>  The parlour fire would not draw that evening and Mr Deda- <lb n="195" />
          lus rested the poker against the bars of the grate to attract the <lb n="196" />
          flame. Uncle Charles dozed in a corner of the half furnished <lb n="197" />
          uncarpeted room and near him the family portraits leaned <lb n="198" />
          against the wall. The lamp on the table shed a weak light over <lb n="199" />
          the boarded floor, muddied by the feet of the vanmen. Stephen <lb n="200" />
          sat on a footstool beside his father listening to a long and <lb n="201" />
          incoherent monologue. He understood little or nothing of it at <lb n="202" />
          first but he became slowly aware that his father had enemies <lb n="203" />
          and that some fight was going to take place. He felt, too, that <lb n="204" />
          he was being enlisted for the fight, that some duty was being <lb n="205" />
          laid upon his shoulders. The sudden flight from the comfort <lb n="206" />
          and revery of <place><location><geo>53.300907, -6.177049</geo></location><placeName>Blackrock</placeName></place>, the passage through the gloomy foggy <lb n="207" />
          city, the thought of the bare cheerless house in which they were <lb n="208" />
          now to live made his heart heavy: and again an intuition or <lb n="209" />
          foreknowledge of the future came to him. He understood also <lb n="210" />
          why the servants had often whispered together in the hall and <lb n="211" />
          why his father had often stood on the hearthrug, with his back <lb n="212" />
          to the fire, talking loudly to uncle Charles who urged him to sit <lb n="213" />
          down and eat his dinner. <lb n="214" />
           <said who="Simon Dedalus">&#8213;There's a crack of the whip left in me yet, Stephen, old chap, <lb n="215" />
          said Mr Dedalus, poking at the dull fire with fierce energy. <lb n="216" />
          We're not dead yet, sonny. No, by the Lord Jesus (God forgive <lb n="217" />
          me) nor half dead. <lb n="218" /></said> </p>
          <p>  <place><location><geo>53.349307, -6.263654</geo></location><placeName>Dublin</placeName></place> was a new and complex sensation. Uncle Charles <lb n="219" />
          had grown so witless that he could no longer be sent out on <lb n="220" />
          errands and the disorder in settling in the new house left Ste- <lb n="221" />
          phen freer than he had been in <place><location><geo>53.300907, -6.177049</geo></location><placeName>Blackrock</placeName></place>. In the beginning he <lb n="222" />
          contented himself with circling timidly round the neighbouring <lb n="223" />
          square or, at most, going half way down one of the side streets: <lb n="224" />
          but when he had made a skeleton map of the city in his mind he <lb n="225" />
          followed boldly one of its central lines until he reached the <lb n="226" />
          customhouse. He passed unchallenged among the docks and <lb n="227" />
          along the quays wondering at the multitude of corks that lay <lb n="228" />
          bobbing on the surface of the water in a thick yellow scum, at <lb n="229" />
          the crowds of quay porters and the rumbling carts and the <lb n="230" />
          illdressed bearded policeman. The vastness and strangeness of <lb n="231" />
          the life suggested to him by the bales of merchandise stacked <lb n="232" />
          along the walls or swung aloft out of the holds of steamers <lb n="233" />
          wakened again in him the unrest which had sent him wan- <lb n="234" />
          dering in the evening from garden to garden in search of <lb n="235" />
          Mercedes. And amid this new bustling life he might have <lb n="236" />
          fancied himself in another <place><location><geo>43.295207, 5.364077</geo></location><placeName>Marseilles</placeName></place> but that he missed the <lb n="237" />
          bright sky and the sunwarmed trellisses of the wineshops. A <lb n="238" />
          vague dissatisfaction grew up within him as he looked on the <lb n="239" />
          quays and on the river and on the lowering skies and yet he <lb n="240" />
          continued to wander up and down day after day as if he really <lb n="241" />
          sought someone that eluded him.<lb n="242" /> </p>
          <p>  He went once or twice with his mother to visit their rela- <lb n="243" />
          tives: and, though they passed a jovial array of shops lit up and <lb n="244" />
          adorned for Christmas, his mood of embittered silence did not <lb n="245" />
          leave him. The causes of his embitterment were many, remote <lb n="246" />
          and near. He was angry with himself for being young and the <lb n="247" />
          prey of restless foolish impulses, angry also with the change of <lb n="248" />
          fortune which was reshaping the world about him into a vision <lb n="249" />
          of squalor and insincerity. Yet his anger lent nothing to the <lb n="250" />
          vision. He chronicled with patience what he saw, detaching <lb n="251" />
          himself from it and tasting its mortifying flavour in secret.<lb n="252" /> </p>
          <p>  He was sitting on the backless chair in his aunt's kitchen. A <lb n="253" />
          lamp with a reflector hung on the japanned wall of the fire- <lb n="254" />
          place and by its light his aunt was reading the evening paper <lb n="255" />
          that lay on her knees. She looked a long time at a smiling <lb n="256" />
          picture that was set in it and said musingly:<lb n="257" /> </p>
           <said who="his aunt">&#8213;The beautiful Mabel Hunter!<lb n="258" /> </said>
          <p>  A ringletted girl stood on tiptoe to peer at the picture and <lb n="259" />
          said softly: <lb n="260" />
           <said who="ringletted girl">&#8213;What is she in, mud? <lb n="261" /> </said>
           <said who="ringletted girl's mother">&#8213;In the pantomime, love. <lb n="262" /></said> </p>
          <p>  The child leaned her ringletted head against her mother's <lb n="263" />
          sleeve, gazing on the picture and murmured, as if fascinated: <lb n="264" />
           <said who="ringletted girl">&#8213;The beautiful Mabel Hunter! <lb n="265" /></said> </p>
          <p>  As if fascinated, her eyes rested long upon those demurely <lb n="266" />
          taunting eyes and she murmured again devotedly: <lb n="267" />
           <said who="ringletted girl">&#8213;Isn't she an exquisite creature? <lb n="268" /></said> </p>
          <p>  And the boy who came in from the street, stamping crook- <lb n="269" />
          edly under his stone of coal, heard her words. He dropped his <lb n="270" />
          load promptly on the floor and hurried to her side to see. But <lb n="271" />
          she did not raise her easeful head to let him see. He mauled the <lb n="272" />
          edges of the paper with his reddened and blackened hands, <lb n="273" />
          shouldering her aside and complaining that he could not see.<lb n="274" /> </p>
          <p>  He was sitting in the narrow breakfast room high up in the <lb n="275" />
          old darkwindowed house. The firelight flickered on the wall <lb n="276" />
          and beyond the window a spectral dusk was gathering upon the <lb n="277" />
          river. Before the fire an old woman was busy making tea and, <lb n="278" />
          as she bustled at her task, she told in a low voice of what the <lb n="279" />
          priest and the doctor had said. She told too of certain changes <lb n="280" />
          that she had seen in her of late and of her odd ways and <lb n="281" />
          sayings. He sat listening to the words and following the ways <lb n="282" />
          of adventure that lay open in the coals, arches and vaults and <lb n="283" />
          winding galleries and jagged caverns.<lb n="284" /> </p>
          <p>  Suddenly he became aware of something in the doorway. A <lb n="285" />
          skull appeared suspended in the gloom of the doorway. A <lb n="286" />
          feeble creature like a monkey was there, drawn thither by the <lb n="287" />
          sound of voices at the fire. A whining voice came from the <lb n="288" />
          door, asking: <lb n="289" />
           <said who="Ellen">&#8213;Is that Josephine? <lb n="290" /></said> </p>
          <p>  The old bustling woman answered cheerily from the fire- <lb n="291" />
          place: <lb n="292" />
           <said who="old woman">&#8213;No, Ellen. It's Stephen. <lb n="293" /> </said>
           <said who="Ellen">&#8213;O .... O, good evening, Stephen. <lb n="294" /></said> </p>
          <p>  He answered the greeting and saw a silly smile break out <lb n="295" />
          over the face in the doorway. <lb n="296" />
           <said who="old woman">&#8213;Do you want anything, Ellen? asked the old woman at the <lb n="297" />
          fire.<lb n="298" /></said> </p>
          <p>  But she did not answer the question and said: <lb n="299" />
           <said who="Ellen">&#8213;I thought it was Josephine. I thought you were Josephine, <lb n="300" />
          Stephen.<lb n="301" /></said> </p>
          <p>  And, repeating this several times, she fell to laughing feebly.<lb n="302" /> </p>
          <p>  He was sitting in the midst of a children's party at <place><location><geo>53.324608, <lb n="303" />
          -6.281580</geo></location><placeName>Harold's
           Cross</placeName></place>. His silent watchful manner had grown upon him and he <lb n="304" />
          took little part in the games. The children, wearing the spoils of <lb n="305" />
          their crackers, danced and romped noisily and, though he tried <lb n="306" />
          to share their merriment, he felt himself a gloomy figure amid <lb n="307" />
          the gay cocked hats and sunbonnets.<lb n="308" /> </p>
          <p>  But when he had sung his song and withdrawn into a snug <lb n="309" />
          corner of the room he began to taste the joy of his loneliness. <lb n="310" />
          The mirth, which in the beginning of the evening had seemed <lb n="311" />
          to him false and trivial, was like a soothing air to him, passing <lb n="312" />
          gaily by his senses, hiding from other eyes the feverish agitation <lb n="313" />
          of his blood while through the circling of the dancers and amid <lb n="314" />
          the music and laughter her glances travelled to his corner, <lb n="315" />
          flattering, taunting, searching, exciting his heart.<lb n="316" /> </p>
          <p>  In the hall the children who had stayed latest were putting <lb n="317" />
          on their things: the party was over. She had thrown a shawl <lb n="318" />
          about her and, as they went together towards the tram, sprays <lb n="319" />
          of her fresh warm breath flew gaily above her cowled head and <lb n="320" />
          her shoes tapped blithely on the glassy road.<lb n="321" /> </p>
          <p>  It was the last tram. The lank brown horses knew it and <lb n="322" />
          shook their bells to the clear night in admonition. The conductor <lb n="323" />
          tor talked with the driver, both nodding often in the green light <lb n="324" />
          of the lamp. On the empty seats of the tram were scattered a <lb n="325" />
          few coloured tickets. No sound of footsteps came up or down <lb n="326" />
          the road. No sound broke the peace of the night save when the <lb n="327" />
          lank brown horses rubbed their noses together and shook their <lb n="328" />
          bells.<lb n="329" /> </p>
          <p>  They seemed to listen, he on the upper step and she on the <lb n="330" />
          lower. She came up to his step many times and went down to <lb n="331" />
          hers again between their phrases and once or twice stood close <lb n="332" />
          beside him for some moments on the upper step, forgetting to <lb n="333" />
          go down, and then went down. His heart danced upon her <lb n="334" />
          movements like a cork upon a tide. He heard what her eyes <lb n="335" />
          said to him from beneath their cowl and knew that in some dim <lb n="336" />
          past, whether in life or in revery, he had heard their tale before. <lb n="337" />
          He saw her urge her vanities, her fine dress and sash and long <lb n="338" />
          black stockings, and knew that he had yielded to them a thou- <lb n="339" />
          sand times. Yet a voice within him spoke above the noise of his <lb n="340" />
          dancing heart, asking him would he take her gift to which he <lb n="341" />
          had only to stretch out his hand. And he remembered the day <lb n="342" />
          when he and Eileen had stood looking into the hotel grounds, <lb n="343" />
          watching the waiters running up a trail of bunting on the <lb n="344" />
          flagstaff and the foxterrier scampering to and fro on the sunny <lb n="345" />
          lawn, and how, all of a sudden, she had broken out into a peal <lb n="346" />
          of laughter and had run down the sloping curve of the path. <lb n="347" />
          Now, as then, he stood listlessly in his place, seemingly a <lb n="348" />
          tranquil watcher of the scene before him.<lb n="349" /> </p>
          <p> &#8213;She too wants me to catch hold of her, he thought. That's <lb n="350" />
          why she came with me to the tram. I could easily catch hold of <lb n="351" />
          her when she comes up to my step: nobody is looking. I could <lb n="352" />
          hold her and kiss her.<lb n="353" /> </p>
          <p>  But he did neither: and, when he was sitting alone in the <lb n="354" />
          deserted tram, he tore his ticket into shreds and stared gloomily <lb n="355" />
          at the corrugated footboard.<lb n="356" /> </p>
          <p>  The next day he sat at his table in the bare upper room for <lb n="357" />
          many hours. Before him lay a new pen, a new bottle of ink and <lb n="358" />
          a new emerald exercise. From force of habit he had written at <lb n="359" />
          the top of the first page the initial letters of the jesuit motto: <lb n="360" />
          A. M. D. G. On the first line of the page appeared the title of <lb n="361" />
          the verses he was trying to write: To E-- C--. He knew it was <lb n="362" />
          right to begin so for he had seen similar titles in the collected <lb n="363" />
          poems of Lord Byron. When he had written this title and <lb n="364" />
          drawn an ornamental line underneath he fell into a daydream <lb n="365" />
          and began to draw diagrams on the cover of the book. He saw <lb n="366" />
          himself sitting at his table in Bray the morning after the dis- <lb n="367" />
          cussion at the Christmas dinnertable, trying to write a poem <lb n="368" />
          about Parnell on the back of one of his father's second moiety <lb n="369" />
          notices. But his brain had then refused to grapple with the <lb n="370" />
          theme and, desisting, he had covered the page with the names <lb n="371" />
          and addresses of certain of his classmates: <lb n="372" />
           Roderick Kickham <lb n="373" />
          John Lawton <lb n="374" />
          Anthony MacSwiney <lb n="375" />
          Simon Moonan<lb n="376" /> </p>
          <p>  Now it seemed as if he would fail again but, by dint of <lb n="377" />
          brooding on the incident, he thought himself into confidence. <lb n="378" />
          During this process all those elements which he deemed com- <lb n="379" />
          mon and insignificant fell out of the scene. There remained no <lb n="380" />
          trace of the tram itself nor of the trammen nor of the horses: <lb n="381" />
          nor did he and she appear vividly. The verses told only of the <lb n="382" />
          night and the balmy breeze and the maiden lustre of the moon. <lb n="383" />
          Some undefined sorrow was hidden in the hearts of the protag- <lb n="384" />
          onists as they stood in silence beneath the leafless trees and <lb n="385" />
          when the moment of farewell had come the kiss, which had <lb n="386" />
          been withheld by one, was given by both. After this the letters <lb n="387" />
          L. D. S. were written at the foot of the page and, having hidden <lb n="388" />
          the book, he went into his mother's bedroom and gazed at his <lb n="389" />
          face for a long time in the mirror of her dressingtable.<lb n="390" /> </p>
          <p>  But his long spell of leisure and liberty was drawing to its <lb n="391" />
          end. One evening his father came home full of news which kept <lb n="392" />
          his tongue busy all through dinner. Stephen had been awaiting <lb n="393" />
          his father's return for there had been mutton hash that day and <lb n="394" />
          he knew that his father would make him dip his bread in the <lb n="395" />
          gravy. But he did not relish the hash for the mention of <lb n="396" />
           <place><location><geo>53.310770, -6.684719</geo></location><placeName>Clongowes</placeName></place> had coated his palate with a scum of disgust. <lb n="397" />
           <said who="Simon Dedalus">&#8213;I walked bang into him, said Mr Dedalus for the fourth <lb n="398" />
          time, just at the corner of the square.<lb n="399" /> </said>
           <said who="Mary Dedalus">&#8213;Then I suppose, said Mrs Dedalus, he will be able to arrange <lb n="400" />
          it. I mean, about Belvedere.<lb n="401" /> </said>
           <said who="Simon Dedalus">&#8213;Of course  he will, said Mr Dedalus. Don't I tell you he's <lb n="402" />
          provincial of the order now? <lb n="403" /> </said>
           <said who="Mary Dedalus">&#8213;I never liked the idea of sending him to the christian brothers <lb n="404" />
          myself, said Mrs Dedalus. <lb n="405" /> </said>
           <said who="Simon Dedalus">&#8213;Christian brothers be damned! said Mr Dedalus. Is it with <lb n="406" />
          Paddy Stink and Mickey Mud? No, let him stick to the jesuits <lb n="407" />
          in God's name since he began with them. They'll be of service <lb n="408" />
          to him in after years. Those are the fellows that can get you a <lb n="409" />
          position.<lb n="410" /> </said>
           <said who="Mary Dedalus">&#8213;And they're a very rich order, aren't they, Simon? <lb n="411" /> </said>
           <said who="Simon Dedalus">&#8213;Rather. They live well, I tell you. You saw their table at <lb n="412" />
           <place><location><geo>53.310770, -6.684719</geo></location><placeName>Clongowes</placeName></place>. Fed up, by God, like gamecocks. <lb n="413" /></said> </p>
          <p>  Mr Dedalus pushed his plate over to Stephen and bade him <lb n="414" />
          finish what was on it. <lb n="415" />
           <said who="Simon Dedalus">&#8213;Now then, Stephen, he said. You must put your shoulder to <lb n="416" />
          the wheel, old chap. You've had a fine long holiday. <lb n="417" /> </said>
           <said who="Mary Dedalus">&#8213;O, I'm sure  he'll work very hard now, said Mrs Dedalus. <lb n="418" />
          Especially when he has Maurice with him. <lb n="419" /> </said>
           <said who="Simon Dedalus">&#8213;O, Holy Paul, I forgot about Maurice, said Mr Dedalus. <lb n="420" />
          Here, Maurice! Come here, you thickheaded ruffian! Do you <lb n="421" />
          know I'm going to send you to a college where they'll teach you <lb n="422" />
          to spell c.a.t: cat. And I'll buy you a nice little penny handker- <lb n="423" />
          chief to keep your nose dry. Won't that be grand fun? <lb n="424" /></said> </p>
          <p>  Maurice grinned at his father and then at his brother. Mr <lb n="425" />
          Dedalus screwed his glass into his eye and stared hard at both <lb n="426" />
          his sons. Stephen mumbled his bread without answering his <lb n="427" />
          father's gaze. <lb n="428" />
           <said who="Simon Dedalus">&#8213;By the bye, said Mr Dedalus at length, the rector, or provin- <lb n="429" />
          cial, rather, was telling me that story about you and Father <lb n="430" />
          Dolan. You're an impudent thief, he said. <lb n="431" /> </said>
           <said who="Mary Dedalus">&#8213;O, he didn't, Simon! <lb n="432" /> </said>
           <said who="Simon Dedalus">&#8213;Not he! said Mr Dedalus. But he gave me a great account of <lb n="433" />
          the whole affair. We were chatting, you know, and one word <lb n="434" />
          borrowed another. And, by the way, who do you think he told <lb n="435" />
          me will get that job in the corporation? But I'll tell you that <lb n="436" />
          after. Well, as I was saying, we were chatting away quite <lb n="437" />
          friendly and he asked me did our friend here wear glasses still <lb n="438" />
          and then he told me the whole story. <lb n="439" /> </said>
           <said who="Mary Dedalus">&#8213;And was he annoyed, Simon? <lb n="440" /> </said>
           <said who="Simon Dedalus">&#8213;Annoyed! Not he! <emph>Manly little chap!</emph> he said. <lb n="441" /></said> </p>
          <p>  Mr Dedalus imitated the mincing nasal tone of the provin- <lb n="442" />
          cial. <lb n="443" />
          <said who="Simon Dedalus">&#8213;Father Dolan and I, when I told them all at dinner about it, <lb n="444" />
          Father Dolan and I had a great laugh over it. <emph>You better mind <lb n="445" />
          yourself, Father Dolan</emph>, said I, <emph>or young Dedalus will send you <lb n="446" />
          up for twice nine</emph>. We had a famous laugh together over it. Ha! <lb n="447" />
          Ha! Ha!<lb n="448" /></said> </p>
          <p>  Mr Dedalus turned to his wife and interjected in his natural <lb n="449" />
          voice: <lb n="450" />
           <said who="Simon Dedalus">&#8213;Shows you the spirit in which they take the boys there. O, a <lb n="451" />
          jesuit for your life, for diplomacy! <lb n="452" /></said> </p>
          <p>  He reassumed the provincial's voice and repeated: <lb n="453" />
           <said who="Simon Dedalus">&#8213;<emph>I told them all at dinner about it and Father Dolan and I and <lb n="454" />
          all of us we all had a hearty laugh together over it. Ha! Ha! Ha!</emph><lb n="455" /></said> </p>

          <p>  The night of the Whitsuntide play had come and Stephen <lb n="456" />
          from the window of the dressingroom looked out on  the small <lb n="457" />
          grassplot across which lines of Chinese lanterns were stretched. <lb n="458" />
          He watched the visitors come down the steps from the house <lb n="459" />
          and pass into the theatre. Stewards in evening dress, old Belve- <lb n="460" />
          dereans, loitered in groups about the entrance to the theatre <lb n="461" />
          and ushered in the visitors with ceremony. Under the sudden <lb n="462" />
          glow of a lantern he could recognise the smiling face of a priest.<lb n="463" /> </p>
          <p>  The Blessed Sacrament had been removed from the taber- <lb n="464" />
          nacle and the first benches had been driven back so as to leave <lb n="465" />
          the dais of the altar and the space before it free. Against the <lb n="466" />
          walls stood companies of barbells and Indian clubs; the dumb- <lb n="467" />
          bells were piled in one corner: and in the midst of countless <lb n="468" />
          hillocks of gymnasium shoes and sweaters and singlets in <lb n="469" />
          untidy brown parcels there stood the stout leatherjacketed <lb n="470" />
          vaulting horse waiting its turn to be carried up on to the stage. <lb n="471" />
          A large bronze shield, tipped with silver, leaned against the <lb n="472" />
          panel of the altar also waiting its turn to be carried up on to the <lb n="473" />
          stage and set in the middle of the winning team at the end of <lb n="474" />
          the gymnastic  display.<lb n="475" /> </p>
          <p>  Stephen, though in deference to his reputation for essay- <lb n="476" />
          writing he had been elected secretary to the gymnasium, had }omit{ no <lb n="477" />
          part in the first section of the programme: but in the play <lb n="478" />
          which formed the second section he had the chief part, that of a <lb n="479" />
          farcical pedagogue. He had been cast for it on account of his <lb n="480" />
          stature and grave manners for he was now at the end of his <lb n="481" />
          second year at Belvedere and in number two.<lb n="482" /> </p>
          <p>  A score of the younger boys in white knickers and singlets <lb n="483" />
          came pattering down from the stage, through the vestry and <lb n="484" />
          into the chapel. The vestry and chapel were peopled with eager <lb n="485" />
          masters and boys. The plump bald sergeantmajor was testing <lb n="486" />
          with his foot the springboard of the vaulting horse. The lean <lb n="487" />
          young man in a long overcoat, who was to give a special <lb n="488" />
          display of intricate club swinging, stood near watching with <lb n="489" />
          interest, his silvercoated clubs peeping out of his deep side- <lb n="490" />
          pockets. The hollow rattle of the wooden dumbbells was heard <lb n="491" />
          as another team made ready to go up on the stage: and in <lb n="492" />
          another moment the excited prefect was hustling the boys <lb n="493" />
          through the vestry like a flock of geese, flapping the wings of <lb n="494" />
          his soutane nervously and crying to the laggards to make haste. <lb n="495" />
          A little troop  of Neapolitan peasants were practising their steps <lb n="496" />
          at the end of the chapel, some arching their arms above their <lb n="497" />
          heads, some swaying their baskets of paper violets and curtsey- <lb n="498" />
          ing. In a dark corner of the chapel at the gospel side of the altar <lb n="499" />
          a stout old lady knelt amid her copious black skirts. When she <lb n="500" />
          stood up a pinkdressed figure, wearing a curly golden wig and <lb n="501" />
          an oldfashioned straw sunbonnet, with black pencilled eye- <lb n="502" />
          brows and cheeks delicately rouged and powdered, was dis- <lb n="503" />
          covered. A low murmur of curiosity ran round the chapel at the <lb n="504" />
          discovery of this girlish figure. One of the prefects, smiling and <lb n="505" />
          nodding his head, approached the dark corner and, having <lb n="506" />
          bowed to the stout old lady, said pleasantly: <lb n="507" />
           <said who="a prefect">&#8213;Is this a beautiful young lady or a doll that you have here, <lb n="508" />
          Mrs Tallon?<lb n="509" /></said> </p>
          <p>  Then, bending down to peer at the smiling painted face un- <lb n="510" />
          der the leaf of the bonnet, he exclaimed: <lb n="511" />
           <said who="a prefect">&#8213;No! Upon my word I believe it's little Bertie Tallon after all! <lb n="512" /></said> </p>
          <p>  Stephen at his post by the window heard the old lady and <lb n="513" />
          the priest laugh together and heard the boys' murmur of ad- <lb n="514" />
          miration behind him as they pressed forward to see the little <lb n="515" />
          boy who had to dance the sunbonnet dance by himself. A <lb n="516" />
          movement of impatience escaped him. He let the edge of the <lb n="517" />
          blind fall and, stepping down from the bench on which he had <lb n="518" />
          been standing, walked out of the chapel.<lb n="519" /> </p>
          <p>  He passed out of the schoolhouse and halted under the shed <lb n="520" />
          that flanked the garden. From the theatre opposite came the <lb n="521" />
          muffled noise of the audience and sudden brazen clashes of the <lb n="522" />
          soldiers' band. The light spread upwards from the glass roof <lb n="523" />
          making the theatre seem a festive ark, anchored amid the hulks <lb n="524" />
          of houses, her frail cables of lanterns looping her to her moor- <lb n="525" />
          ings. A sidedoor of the theatre opened suddenly and a shaft of <lb n="526" />
          light flew across the grassplots. A sudden burst of music issued <lb n="527" />
          from the ark, the prelude of a waltz: and when the sidedoor <lb n="528" />
          closed again the listener could hear the faint rhythm of the <lb n="529" />
          music. The sentiment of the opening bars, their languor and <lb n="530" />
          supple movement, evoked the incommunicable emotion which <lb n="531" />
          had been the cause of all his day's unrest and of his impatient <lb n="532" />
          movement of a moment before. His unrest issued from him like <lb n="533" />
          a wave of sound: and on the tide of flowing music the ark was <lb n="534" />
          journeying, trailing her cables of lanterns in her wake. Then a <lb n="535" />
          noise like dwarf artillery broke the movement. It was the <lb n="536" />
          clapping that greeted the entry of the dumbbell team on the <lb n="537" />
          stage.<lb n="538" /> </p>
          <p>  At the far end of the shed near the street a speck of pink <lb n="539" />
          light showed in the darkness and as he walked towards it he <lb n="540" />
          became aware of a faint aromatic odour. Two boys were <lb n="541" />
          standing in the shelter of the doorway, smoking, and before he <lb n="542" />
          reached them he had recognised Heron by his voice. <lb n="543" />
           <said who="Heron">&#8213;Here comes the noble Dedalus! cried a high throaty voice. <lb n="544" />
          Welcome to our trusty friend! <lb n="545" /></said> </p>
          <p>  This welcome ended in a soft peal of mirthless laughter as <lb n="546" />
          Heron salaamed and then began to poke the ground with his <lb n="547" />
          cane. <lb n="548" />
           <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;Here I am, said Stephen, halting and glancing from Heron to <lb n="549" />
          his friend. <lb n="550" /></said> </p>
          <p>  The latter was a stranger to him but in the darkness, by the <lb n="551" />
          aid of the glowing cigarette tips, he could make out a pale <lb n="552" />
          dandyish face, over which a smile was travelling slowly, a tall <lb n="553" />
          overcoated figure and a hard hat. Heron did not trouble him- <lb n="554" />
          self about an introduction but said instead: <lb n="555" />
           <said who="Heron">&#8213;I was just telling my friend Wallis what a lark it would be <lb n="556" />
          tonight if you took off the rector in the part of the school- <lb n="557" />
          master. It would be a ripping good joke. <lb n="558" /></said> </p>
          <p>  Heron made a poor attempt to imitate for his friend Wallis <lb n="559" />
          the rector's pedantic bass and then, laughing at his failure, <lb n="560" />
          asked Stephen to do it. <lb n="561" />
           <said who="Heron">&#8213;Go on, Dedalus, he urged. You can take him off rippingly. <lb n="562" />
          <lg>
            <l>He that will not hear the churcha let him be to theea as</l> <l>the <lb n="563" />
            heathena and the publicana.</l> <lb n="564" />
          </lg> </said></p>
          <p>  The imitation was prevented by a mild expression of anger <lb n="565" />
          from Wallis in whose mouthpiece the cigarette had become too <lb n="566" />
          tightly wedged. <lb n="567" />
           <said who="Wallis">&#8213;Damn this blankety blank holder, he said, taking it from his <lb n="568" />
          mouth and smiling and frowning upon it tolerantly. It's always <lb n="569" />
          getting stuck like that. Do you use a holder? <lb n="570" /> </said>
           <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;I don't smoke, answered Stephen. <lb n="571" /> </said>
           <said who="Heron">&#8213;No, said Heron, Dedalus is a model youth. He doesn't <lb n="572" />
          smoke and he doesn't go to bazaars and he doesn't flirt and he <lb n="573" />
          doesn't damn anything or damn all. <lb n="574" /></said> </p>
          <p>  Stephen shook his head and smiled in his rival's flushed and <lb n="575" />
          mobile face, beaked like a bird's. He had often thought it <lb n="576" />
          strange that Vincent Heron had a bird's face as well as a bird's <lb n="577" />
          name. A shock of pale hair lay on the forehead like a ruffled <lb n="578" />
          crest: the forehead was narrow and bony and a thin hooked <lb n="579" />
          nose stood out between the closeset prominent eyes which were <lb n="580" />
          light and inexpressive. The rivals were school friends. They sat <lb n="581" />
          together in class, knelt together in the chapel, talked together <lb n="582" />
          after beads over their lunches. As the fellows in number one <lb n="583" />
          were undistinguished dullards Stephen and Heron had been <lb n="584" />
          during the year the virtual heads of the school. It was they who <lb n="585" />
          went up to the rector together to ask for a free day or to get a <lb n="586" />
          fellow off. <lb n="587" />
           <said who="Heron">&#8213;O by the way, said Heron suddenly, I saw your governor <lb n="588" />
          going in. <lb n="589" /></said> </p>
          <p>  The smile waned on Stephen's face. Any allusion made to his <lb n="590" />
          father by a fellow or by a master put his calm to rout in a <lb n="591" />
          moment. He waited in timorous silence to hear what Heron <lb n="592" />
          might say next. Heron, however, nudged him expressively with <lb n="593" />
          his elbow and said: <lb n="594" />
           <said who="Heron">&#8213;You're a sly dog, Dedalus! <lb n="595" /> </said>
           <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;Why so? said Stephen. <lb n="596" /> </said>
           <said who="Heron">&#8213;You'd think butter wouldn't melt in your mouth, said <lb n="597" />
          Heron. But I'm afraid you're a sly dog. <lb n="598" /> </said>
           <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;Might I ask you what you are talking about? said Stephen <lb n="599" />
          urbanely.<lb n="600" /> </said>
           <said who="Heron">&#8213;Indeed  you might, answered Heron. We saw her, Wallis, <lb n="601" />
          didn't we? And deucedly pretty she is too. And so inquisitive! <lb n="602" />
          <emph>And what part does Stephen take, Mr Dedalus? And will <lb n="603" />
          Stephen not sing, Mr Dedalus?</emph> Your governor was staring at <lb n="604" />
          her through that eyeglass of his for all he was worth so that I <lb n="605" />
          think the old man has found you out too. I wouldn't care a bit, <lb n="606" />
          by Jove. She's  ripping, isn't she, Wallis? <lb n="607" /> </said>
           <said who="Wallis">&#8213;Not half bad, answered Wallis quietly as he placed his <lb n="608" />
          holder once more in a corner of his mouth. <lb n="609" /></said> </p>
          <p>  A shaft of momentary anger flew through Stephen's mind at <lb n="610" />
          these indelicate allusions in the hearing of a stranger. For him <lb n="611" />
          there was nothing amusing in a girl's interest and regard. All <lb n="612" />
          day he had thought of nothing but their leavetaking on the <lb n="613" />
          steps of the tram at <place><location><geo>53.324608, -6.281580</geo></location><placeName>Harold's Cross</placeName></place>, the stream of moody <lb n="614" />
          emotions it had made to course through him and the poem he <lb n="615" />
          had written about it. All day he had imagined a new meeting <lb n="616" />
          with her for he knew that she was to come to the play. The old <lb n="617" />
          restless moodiness had again filled his heart as it had done on <lb n="618" />
          the night of the party but had not found  an outlet in verse. The <lb n="619" />
          growth and knowledge of two years of boyhood stood between <lb n="620" />
          then and now, forbidding such an outlet: and all day the stream <lb n="621" />
          of gloomy tenderness within him had started forth and re- <lb n="622" />
          turned upon itself in dark courses and eddies, wearying him in <lb n="623" />
          the end until the pleasantry of the prefect and the painted little <lb n="624" />
          boy had drawn from him a movement of impatience. <lb n="625" />
           <said who="Heron">&#8213;So you may as well admit, Heron went on, that we've fairly <lb n="626" />
          found you out this time. You can't play the saint on me any <lb n="627" />
          more, that's one sure five. <lb n="628" /></said> </p>
          <p>  A soft peal of mirthless laughter escaped from his lips and, <lb n="629" />
          bending down as before, he struck Stephen lightly across the <lb n="630" />
          calf of the leg with his cane, as if in jesting reproof.<lb n="631" /> </p>
          <p>  Stephen's moment of anger had already passed. He was nei- <lb n="632" />
          ther flattered nor confused but simply wished the banter to <lb n="633" />
          end. He scarcely resented what had seemed to him at first a <lb n="634" />
          silly indelicateness for he knew that the adventure in his mind <lb n="635" />
          stood in no danger from their words: and his face mirrored his <lb n="636" />
          rival's false smile. <lb n="637" />
           <said who="Heron">&#8213;Admit! repeated Heron, striking him again with his cane <lb n="638" />
          across the calf of the leg. <lb n="639" /></said> </p>
          <p>  The stroke was playful but not so lightly given as the first <lb n="640" />
          one had been. Stephen felt the skin tingle and glow slightly and <lb n="641" />
          almost painlessly; and bowing submissively, as if to meet his <lb n="642" />
          companion's jesting mood, began to recite the <seg xml:lang="la">Confiteor</seg>. The <lb n="643" />
          episode ended well for both Heron and Wallis laughed indul- <lb n="644" />
          gently at the irreverence.<lb n="645" /> </p>
          <p>  The confession came only from Stephen's lips and, while <lb n="646" />
          they spoke the words, a sudden memory had carried him to <lb n="647" />
          another scene called up, as if by magic, at the moment when he <lb n="648" />
          had noted the faint cruel dimples at the corners of Heron's <lb n="649" />
          smiling lips and had felt the familiar stroke of the cane against <lb n="650" />
          his calf and had heard the familiar word of admonition: <lb n="651" />
          <said who="Heron">&#8213;Admit!<lb n="652" /></said> </p>
          <p>  It was towards the close of his first term in the college when <lb n="653" />
          he was in number six. His sensitive nature was still smarting <lb n="654" />
          under the lashes of an undivined and squalid way of life. His <lb n="655" />
          soul was still disquieted and cast down by the dull phenom- <lb n="656" />
          enon of <place><location><geo>53.349307, -6.263654</geo></location><placeName>Dublin</placeName></place>. He had emerged from a two years' spell of <lb n="657" />
          revery to find himself in the midst of a new scene, every event <lb n="658" />
          and figure of which affected him intimately, disheartened him <lb n="659" />
          or allured him and, whether alluring or disheartening, filled <lb n="660" />
          him always with unrest and bitter thoughts. All the leisure that <lb n="661" />
          his school life left him was passed in the company of subversive <lb n="662" />
          writers whose gibes and violence of speech set up a ferment in <lb n="663" />
          his brain before they passed out of it into his crude writings.<lb n="664" /> </p>
          <p>  The essay was for him the chief labour of his week and every <lb n="665" />
          Tuesday, as he marched from home to the school, he read his <lb n="666" />
          fate in the incidents of the way, pitting himself against some <lb n="667" />
          figure ahead of him and quickening his pace to outstrip it be- <lb n="668" />
          fore a certain goal was reached or planting his steps scrupu- <lb n="669" />
          lously in the spaces of the patchwork of the footpath and <lb n="670" />
          telling himself that he would be first and not first in the weekly <lb n="671" />
          essay.<lb n="672" /> </p>
          <p>  On a certain Tuesday the course of his triumphs was rudely <lb n="673" />
          broken. Mr Tate, the English master, pointed his finger at him <lb n="674" />
          and said bluntly: <lb n="675" />
           <said who="Mr Tate">&#8213;This fellow has heresy in his essay. <lb n="676" /></said> </p>
          <p>  A hush fell on the class. Mr Tate did not break it but dug <lb n="677" />
          with his hand between his crossed thighs while his heavily <lb n="678" />
          starched linen creaked about his neck and wrists. Stephen did <lb n="679" />
          not look up. It was a raw spring morning and his eyes were still <lb n="680" />
          smarting and weak. He was conscious of failure and of detec- <lb n="681" />
          tion, of the squalor of his own mind and home, and felt against <lb n="682" />
          his neck the raw edge of his turned and jagged collar.<lb n="683" /> </p>
          <p>  A short loud laugh from Mr Tate set the class more at ease. <lb n="684" />
           <said who="Mr Tate">&#8213;Perhaps you didn't know that, he said. <lb n="685" /> </said>
           <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;Where? asked Stephen. <lb n="686" /></said> </p>
          <p>  Mr Tate withdrew his delving hand and spread out the es- <lb n="687" />
          say. <lb n="688" />
           <said who="Mr Tate">&#8213;Here. It's about the Creator and the soul. Rrm ... rrm ..... <lb n="689" />
          rrm ...  Ah! <emph>without a possibility of ever approaching nearer</emph>. <lb n="690" />
          That's heresy. <lb n="691" /></said> </p>
          <p>  Stephen murmured: <lb n="692" />
           <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;I meant <emph>without a possibility of ever reaching</emph>. <lb n="693" /></said> </p>
          <p>  It was a submission and Mr Tate, appeased, folded up the <lb n="694" />
          essay and passed it across to him, saying: <lb n="695" />
           <said who="Mr Tate">&#8213;O ... Ah! <emph>ever reaching</emph>. That's another story. <lb n="696" /></said> </p>
          <p>  But the class was not so soon appeased. Though nobody <lb n="697" />
          spoke to him of the affair after class he could feel about him a <lb n="698" />
          vague general malignant joy.<lb n="699" /> </p>
          <p>  A few nights after this public chiding  he was walking with a <lb n="700" />
          letter along the Drumcondra Road when he heard a voice cry: <lb n="701" />
           <said who="Heron">&#8213;Halt! <lb n="702" /></said> </p>
          <p>  He turned and saw three boys of his own class coming to- <lb n="703" />
          wards him in the dusk. It was Heron who had called out and, <lb n="704" />
          as he marched forward between his two attendants, he cleft the <lb n="705" />
          air before him with a thin cane, in time to their steps. Boland, <lb n="706" />
          his friend, marched beside him, a large grin on his face, while <lb n="707" />
          Nash came on a few steps behind, blowing from the pace and <lb n="708" />
          wagging his great red head.<lb n="709" /> </p>
          <p>  As soon as the boys had turned into <place><location><geo>53.362304, -6.249867</geo></location><placeName>Clonliffe Road</placeName></place>together <lb n="710" />
          they began to speak about books and writers, saying what <lb n="711" />
          books they were reading and how many books there were in <lb n="712" />
          their fathers' bookcases at home. Stephen listened to them in <lb n="713" />
          some wonderment for Boland was the dunce and Nash the idler <lb n="714" />
          of the class. In fact after some talk about their favourite writers <lb n="715" />
          Nash declared for Captain Marryat who, he said, was the <lb n="716" />
          greatest writer. <lb n="717" />
           <said who="Heron">&#8213;Fudge! said Heron. Ask Dedalus. Who is the greatest writer, <lb n="718" />
          Dedalus?<lb n="719" /></said> </p>
          <p>  Stephen noted the mockery in the question and said: <lb n="720" />
           <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;Of prose, do you mean? <lb n="721" /> </said>
           <said who="Heron">&#8213;Yes.<lb n="722" /> </said>
           <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;Newman, I think. <lb n="723" /> </said>
           <said who="Boland">&#8213;Is it Cardinal Newman? asked Boland. <lb n="724" /> </said>
           <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;Yes, answered Stephen. <lb n="725" /></said> </p>
          <p>  The grin broadened on Nash's freckled face as he turned to <lb n="726" />
          Stephen and said: <lb n="727" />
           <said who="Nash">&#8213;And do you like Cardinal Newman, Dedalus? <lb n="728" /> </said>
           <said who="Heron">&#8213;O, many people say that Newman has the best prose style, <lb n="729" />
          Heron said to the other two in explanation. Of course, he's not <lb n="730" />
          a poet. <lb n="731" /> </said>
           <said who="Boland">&#8213;And who is the best poet, Heron? asked Boland. <lb n="732" /> </said>
           <said who="Heron">&#8213;Lord Tennyson, of course, answered Heron. <lb n="733" /> </said>
           <said who="Nash">&#8213;O, yes, Lord Tennyson, said Nash. We have all his poetry at <lb n="734" />
          home in a book. <lb n="735" /></said> </p>
          <p>  At this Stephen forgot the silent vows he had been making <lb n="736" />
          and burst out: <lb n="737" />
           <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;Tennyson a poet! Why, he's only a rhymester! <lb n="738" /> </said>
           <said who="Heron">&#8213;O, get out! said Heron. Everyone knows that Tennyson is <lb n="739" />
          the greatest poet. <lb n="740" /> </said>
           <said who="Boland">&#8213;And who do you think is the greatest poet? asked Boland, <lb n="741" />
          nudging his neighbour. <lb n="742" /> </said>
           <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;Byron, of course, answered Stephen. <lb n="743" /></said> </p>
          <p>  Heron gave the lead and all three joined in a scornful laugh. <lb n="744" />
           <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;What are you laughing at? asked Stephen. <lb n="745" /> </said>
           <said who="Heron">&#8213;You, said Heron. Byron the greatest poet! He's only a poet <lb n="746" />
          for uneducated people. <lb n="747" /> </said>
           <said who="Boland">&#8213;He must be a fine poet! said Boland. <lb n="748" /> </said>
           <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;You may keep your mouth shut, said Stephen, turning on <lb n="749" />
          him boldly. All you know about poetry is what you wrote up <lb n="750" />
          on the slates in the yard and were going to be sent to the loft <lb n="751" />
          for.<lb n="752" /></said> </p>
          <p>  Boland, in fact, was said to have written on the slates in the <lb n="753" />
          yard a couplet about a classmate of his who often rode home <lb n="754" />
          from the college on a pony:<lb n="755" /> </p>
          <lg>
             <l>As Tyson was riding into Jerusalem</l> <lb n="756" />
             <l>He fell and hurt his Alec Kafoozelum.</l> <lb n="757" />
          </lg>
          <p>  This thrust put the two lieutenants to silence but Heron <lb n="758" />
          went on: <lb n="759" />
           <said who="Heron">&#8213;In any case Byron was a heretic and immoral too. <lb n="760" /> </said>
           <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;I don't care what he was, cried Stephen hotly. <lb n="761" /> </said>
           <said who="Nash">&#8213;You don't care whether he was a heretic or not? said Nash. <lb n="762" /> </said>
           <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;What do you know about it? shouted Stephen. You never <lb n="763" />
          read a line of anything in your life except a trans or Boland <lb n="764" />
          either.<lb n="765" /> </said>
           <said who="Boland">&#8213;I know that Byron was a bad man, said Boland. <lb n="766" /> </said>
           <said who="Heron">&#8213;Here, Catch hold of this heretic, Heron called out. <lb n="767" /></said> </p>
          <p>  In a moment Stephen was a prisoner. <lb n="768" />
           <said who="Heron">&#8213;Tate made you buck up the other day, Heron went on, about <lb n="769" />
          the heresy in your essay. <lb n="770" /> </said>
           <said who="Boland">&#8213;I'll tell him tomorrow, said Boland. <lb n="771" /> </said>
           <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;Will you? said Stephen. You'd be afraid to open your lips. <lb n="772" /> </said>
           <said who="Boland">&#8213;Afraid?<lb n="773" /> </said>
           <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;Ay. Afraid of your life. <lb n="774" /> </said>
           <said who="Heron">&#8213;Behave yourself! cried Heron, cutting at Stephen's legs with <lb n="775" />
          his cane. <lb n="776" /></said> </p>
          <p>  It was the signal for their  onset. Nash pinioned his arms <lb n="777" />
          behind while Boland seized a long cabbage stump which was <lb n="778" />
          lying in the gutter. Struggling and kicking under the cuts of the <lb n="779" />
          cane and the blows of the knotty stump Stephen was borne <lb n="780" />
          back against a barbed wire fence. <lb n="781" />
           <said who="Heron">&#8213;Admit that Byron was no good. <lb n="782" /> </said>
           <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;No.<lb n="783" /> </said>
           <said who="Heron">&#8213;Admit.<lb n="784" /> </said>
           <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;No.<lb n="785" /> </said>
           <said who="Heron">&#8213;Admit.<lb n="786" /> </said>
           <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;No. No. <lb n="787" /></said> </p>
          <p>  At last after a fury of plunges he wrenched himself free. His <lb n="788" />
          tormentors set off towards <place><location><geo>53.360891, -6.251230</geo></location><placeName>Jones's Road</placeName></place>, laughing and jeering <lb n="789" />
          at him, while he, }omit{ half blinded with tears, stumbled on, clench- <lb n="790" />
          ing his fists madly and sobbing.<lb n="791" /> </p>
          <p>  While he was still repeating the <seg xml:lang="la">Confiteor</seg> amid the indul- <lb n="792" />
          gent laughter of his hearers and while the scenes of that <lb n="793" />
          malignant episode were still passing sharply and swiftly before <lb n="794" />
          his mind he wondered why he bore no malice now to those <lb n="795" />
          who had tormented him. He had not forgotten a whit of their <lb n="796" />
          cowardice and cruelty but the memory of it called forth no <lb n="797" />
          anger from him. All the descriptions of fierce love and hatred <lb n="798" />
          which he had met in books had  seemed to him therefore unreal. <lb n="799" />
          Even that night as he stumbled homewards along <place><location><geo>53.360891, -6.251230</geo></location><placeName>Jones's Road</placeName></place> <lb n="800" />
          he had felt that some power was divesting him of that sudden- <lb n="801" />
          woven anger as easily as a fruit is divested of her soft ripe peel.<lb n="802" /> </p>
          <p>  He remained standing with his two companions at the end <lb n="803" />
          of the shed, listening idly to their talk or to the bursts of <lb n="804" />
          applause in the theatre. She was sitting there among the others, <lb n="805" />
          perhaps waiting for him to appear. He tried to recall her ap- <lb n="806" />
          pearance but could not. He could remember only that she had <lb n="807" />
          worn a shawl about her head like a cowl and that her dark eyes <lb n="808" />
          had invited and unnerved him. He wondered had he been in her <lb n="809" />
          thoughts as she had been in his. Then in the dark and unseen <lb n="810" />
          by the other two he rested the tips of the fingers of one hand <lb n="811" />
          upon the palm of the other hand, scarcely touching it and yet <lb n="812" />
          pressing upon it lightly. But the pressure of her fingers had <lb n="813" />
          been lighter and steadier: and suddenly the memory of their <lb n="814" />
          touch traversed his brain and body like an invisible warm <lb n="815" />
          wave.<lb n="816" /> </p>
          <p>  A boy came towards them, running along under the shed. <lb n="817" />
          He was excited and breathless. <lb n="818" />
           <said who="a boy">&#8213;O, Dedalus, he cried, Doyle is in a great bake about you. <lb n="819" />
          You're to go in at once and get dressed for the play. Hurry up, <lb n="820" />
          you better. <lb n="821" /> </said>
           <said who="Heron">&#8213;He's coming now, said Heron to the messenger with a <lb n="822" />
          haughty drawl, when he wants to. <lb n="823" /></said> </p>
          <p>  The boy turned to Heron and repeated: <lb n="824" />
           <said who="a boy">&#8213;But Doyle is in an awful bake. <lb n="825" /> </said>
           <said who="Heron">&#8213;Will you tell Doyle with my best compliments that I damned <lb n="826" />
          his eyes? answered Heron. <lb n="827" /> </said>
           <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;Well, I must go now, said Stephen who cared little for such <lb n="828" />
          points of honour. <lb n="829" /> </said>
           <said who="Heron">&#8213;I wouldn't, said Heron, damn me if I would. That's no way <lb n="830" />
          to send for one of the senior boys. In a bake, indeed! I think it's <lb n="831" />
          quite enough that you're taking a part in his bally old play. <lb n="832" /></said> </p>
          <p>  This spirit of quarrelsome comradeship which he had ob- <lb n="833" />
          served lately in his rival had not seduced Stephen from his <lb n="834" />
          habits of quiet obedience. He mistrusted the turbulence and <lb n="835" />
          doubted the sincerity of such comradeship which seemed to <lb n="836" />
          him a sorry anticipation of manhood. The question of honour <lb n="837" />
          here raised was, like all such questions, trivial to him. While his <lb n="838" />
          mind had been pursuing its intangible phantoms and turning in <lb n="839" />
          irresolution from such pursuit he had heard about him the <lb n="840" />
          constant voices of his father and of his masters, urging him to <lb n="841" />
          be a gentleman above all things and urging him to be a good <lb n="842" />
          catholic above all things. These voices had now come to be <lb n="843" />
          hollowsounding in his ears. When the gymnasium had been <lb n="844" />
          opened he had heard another voice urging him to be strong and <lb n="845" />
          manly and healthy and when the movement towards national <lb n="846" />
          revival had begun to be felt in the college yet another voice had <lb n="847" />
          bidden him  be true to his country and help to raise up her <lb n="848" />
          fallen language and tradition. In the profane world, as he <lb n="849" />
          foresaw, a worldly voice would bid him raise up his father's <lb n="850" />
          fallen state by his labours and, meanwhile, the voice of his <lb n="851" />
          schoolcomrades urged him to be a decent fellow, to shield <lb n="852" />
          others from blame or to beg them off and to do his best to get <lb n="853" />
          free days for the school. And it was the din of all these hollow- <lb n="854" />
          sounding voices that made him halt irresolutely in the pursuit <lb n="855" />
          of phantoms. He gave them ear only for a time but he was <lb n="856" />
          happy only when he was far from them, beyond their call, <lb n="857" />
          alone or in the company of phantasmal comrades.<lb n="858" /> </p>
          <p>  In the vestry a plump freshfaced jesuit and an elderly man, in <lb n="859" />
          shabby blue clothes, were dabbling in a case of paints and <lb n="860" />
          chalks. The boys who had been painted walked about or stood <lb n="861" />
          still awkwardly, touching their faces in a gingerly fashion with <lb n="862" />
          their furtive fingertips. In the middle of the vestry a young <lb n="863" />
          jesuit, who was then on a visit to the college, stood rocking <lb n="864" />
          himself rhythmically from the tips of his toes to his heels and <lb n="865" />
          back again, his hands thrust well forward into his sidepockets. <lb n="866" />
          His small head set off with glossy red curls and his newly <lb n="867" />
          shaven face agreed well with the spotless decency of his soutane <lb n="868" />
          and with his spotless shoes.<lb n="869" /> </p>
          <p>  As he watched this swaying form and tried to read for him- <lb n="870" />
          self the legend of the priest's mocking smile there came into <lb n="871" />
          Stephen's memory a saying which he had heard from his father <lb n="872" />
          before he had been sent to <place><location><geo>53.310770, -6.684719</geo></location><placeName>Clongowes</placeName></place>, that you could always <lb n="873" />
          tell a jesuit by the style of his clothes. At the same moment he <lb n="874" />
          thought he saw a likeness between his father's mind and that of <lb n="875" />
          this smiling welldressed priest: and he was aware of some des- <lb n="876" />
          ecration of the priest's office or of the vestry itself, whose si- <lb n="877" />
          lence was now routed by loud talk and joking and its air <lb n="878" />
          pungent with the smells of the gasjets and the grease.<lb n="879" /> </p>
          <p>  While his forehead was being wrinkled and his jaws painted <lb n="880" />
          black and blue by the elderly man he listened distractedly to the <lb n="881" />
          voice of the plump young jesuit which bade him speak up and <lb n="882" />
          make his points clearly. He could hear the band playing <emph>The <lb n="883" />
          Lily of Killarney</emph> and knew that in a few moments the curtain <lb n="884" />
          would go up. He felt no stage fright but the thought of the part <lb n="885" />
          he had to play humiliated him. A remembrance  of some of his <lb n="886" />
          lines made a sudden flush rise to his painted cheeks. He saw her <lb n="887" />
          serious alluring eyes watching him from among the audience <lb n="888" />
          and their image at once swept away his scruples, leaving his <lb n="889" />
          will compact. Another nature seemed to have been lent him: <lb n="890" />
          the infection of the excitement and youth about him entered <lb n="891" />
          into and transformed his moody mistrustfulness. For one rare <lb n="892" />
          moment he seemed to be clothed in the real apparel of boy- <lb n="893" />
          hood: and, as he stood in the wings among the other players, he <lb n="894" />
          shared the common mirth amid which the drop scene was <lb n="895" />
          hauled upwards by two ablebodied priests with violent jerks <lb n="896" />
          and all awry.<lb n="897" /> </p>
          <p>  A few moments after he found himself on the stage amid the <lb n="898" />
          garish gas and the dim scenery, acting before the innumerable <lb n="899" />
          faces of the void. It surprised him to see that the play which he <lb n="900" />
          had known at rehearsals for a disjointed lifeless thing had <lb n="901" />
          suddenly assumed a life of its own. It seemed now to play itself, <lb n="902" />
          he and his fellow actors aiding it with their parts. When the <lb n="903" />
          curtain fell on the last scene he heard the void filled with <lb n="904" />
          applause and, through a rift in the side scene, saw the simple <lb n="905" />
          body before which he had acted magically deformed, the void <lb n="906" />
          of faces breaking at all points and falling asunder into busy <lb n="907" />
          groups.<lb n="908" /> </p>
          <p>  He left the stage quickly and rid himself of his mummery <lb n="909" />
          and passed out through the chapel into the college garden. <lb n="910" />
          Now that the play was over his nerves cried for some further <lb n="911" />
          adventure. He hurried onwards as if to overtake it. The doors <lb n="912" />
          of the theatre were all open and the audience had emptied out. <lb n="913" />
          On the lines which he had fancied the moorings of an ark a few <lb n="914" />
          lanterns swung in the night breeze, flickering cheerlessly. He <lb n="915" />
          mounted the steps from the garden in haste, eager that some <lb n="916" />
          prey should not elude him, and forced his way through the <lb n="917" />
          crowd in the hall and past the two jesuits who stood watching <lb n="918" />
          the exodus and bowing and shaking hands with the visitors. He <lb n="919" />
          pushed onward nervously, feigning a still greater haste and <lb n="920" />
          faintly conscious of the smiles and stares and nudges which his <lb n="921" />
          powdered head left in its wake.<lb n="922" /> </p>
          <p>  When he came out on the steps he saw his family waiting for <lb n="923" />
          him at the first lamp. In a glance he noted that every figure of <lb n="924" />
          the group was familiar and ran down the steps angrily. <lb n="925" />
           <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;I have to leave a message down in George's Street, he said to <lb n="926" />
          his father quickly. I'll be home after you. <lb n="927" /></said> </p>
          <p>  Without waiting for his father's questions  he ran across the <lb n="928" />
          road and began to walk at breakneck speed down the hill. He <lb n="929" />
          hardly knew where he was walking. Pride and hope and desire <lb n="930" />
          like crushed herbs in his heart sent up vapours of maddening <lb n="931" />
          incense before the eyes of his mind. He strode down the hill <lb n="932" />
          amid the tumult of suddenrisen vapours of wounded pride and <lb n="933" />
          fallen hope and baffled desire. They streamed upwards before <lb n="934" />
          his anguished eyes in dense and maddening fumes and passed <lb n="935" />
          away above him till at last the air was clear and cold again.<lb n="936" /> </p>
          <p>  A film still veiled his eyes but they burned no longer. A <lb n="937" />
          power, akin to that which had often made anger or resentment <lb n="938" />
          fall from him, brought his steps to rest. He stood still and <lb n="939" />
          gazed up at the sombre porch of the morgue and from that to <lb n="940" />
          the dark cobbled laneway at its side. He saw the word <emph>Lotts</emph> on <lb n="941" />
          the wall of the lane and breathed slowly the rank heavy air.<lb n="942" /> </p>
          <p> &#8213;That is horse piss and rotted straw, he thought. It is a good <lb n="943" />
          odour to breathe. It will calm my heart. My heart is quite calm <lb n="944" />
          now. I will go back.<lb n="945" /> </p>

          <p>  Stephen was once again seated beside his father in the corner <lb n="946" />
          of a railway carriage at Kingsbridge. He was travelling with his <lb n="947" />
          father by the night mail to Cork. As the train steamed out of <lb n="948" />
          the station he recalled his childish wonder of years before and <lb n="949" />
          every event of his first day at <place><location><geo>53.310770, -6.684719</geo></location><placeName>Clongowes</placeName></place>. But he felt no wonder <lb n="950" />
          now. He saw the darkening lands slipping past him, the silent <lb n="951" />
          telegraphpoles passing his window swiftly every four seconds, <lb n="952" />
          the little glimmering stations, manned by a few silent sentries, <lb n="953" />
          flung by the mail behind her and twinkling for a moment in the <lb n="954" />
          darkness like fiery grains flung backwards by a runner.<lb n="955" /> </p>
          <p>  He listened without sympathy to his father's evocation of <lb n="956" />
          Cork and of scenes of his youth, a tale broken by sighs or <lb n="957" />
          draughts from his pocket flask whenever the image of some <lb n="958" />
          dead friend appeared in it or whenever the evoker remembered <lb n="959" />
          suddenly the purpose of his actual visit. Stephen heard but <lb n="960" />
          could feel no pity. The images of the dead were all strange to <lb n="961" />
          him save that of uncle Charles, an image which had lately been <lb n="962" />
          fading out of memory. He knew, however, that his father's <lb n="963" />
          property was going to be sold by auction and in the manner of <lb n="964" />
          his own dispossession he felt the world give the lie rudely to his <lb n="965" />
          phantasy.<lb n="966" /> </p>
          <p>  At Maryborough he fell asleep. When he awoke the train <lb n="967" />
          had passed out of Mallow and his father was stretched asleep <lb n="968" />
          on the other seat. The cold light of the dawn lay over the <lb n="969" />
          country, over the unpeopled fields and the closed cottages. The <lb n="970" />
          terror of sleep fascinated his mind as he watched the silent <lb n="971" />
          country or heard from time to time his father's deep breath or <lb n="972" />
          sudden sleepy movement. The neighbourhood of unseen <lb n="973" />
          sleepers filled him with strange dread as though they could <lb n="974" />
          harm him; and he prayed that the day might come quickly. His <lb n="975" />
          prayer, addressed neither to God nor saint, began with a shiver, <lb n="976" />
          as the chilly morning breeze crept through the chink of the <lb n="977" />
          carriage door to his feet, and ended in a trail of foolish words <lb n="978" />
          which he made to fit the insistent rhythm of the train: and <lb n="979" />
          silently, at intervals of four seconds, the telegraphpoles held the <lb n="980" />
          galloping notes of the music between punctual bars. This furi- <lb n="981" />
          ous music allayed his dread and, leaning against the window- <lb n="982" />
          ledge, he let his eyelids close again.<lb n="983" /> </p>
          <p>  They drove in a jingle across Cork while it was still early <lb n="984" />
          morning and Stephen finished his sleep in a bedroom of the <lb n="985" />
          Victoria Hotel. The bright warm sunlight was streaming <lb n="986" />
          through the window and he could hear the din of traffic. His <lb n="987" />
          father was standing before the dressingtable, examining his <lb n="988" />
          hair and face and moustache with great care, craning his neck <lb n="989" />
          across the waterjug and drawing it back sideways to see the <lb n="990" />
          better. While he did so he sang softly to himself with quaint <lb n="991" />
          accent and phrasing: <lb n="992" />
          <said who="Simon Dedalus">
            <lg>
               <l>'Tis youth and folly </l> <lb n="993" />

              <l>So here, my love, I'll </l> <lb n="995" />

              <l>Must be injured, sure, </l> <lb n="998" />
              <l>So I'll go to </l> <lb n="999" />

              <l>But when 'tis old </l> <lb n="1005" />
              <l>And growing cold </l> <lb n="1006" />
              <l>It fades and dies like </l> <lb n="1007" />
              <l>The mountain dew.</l> <lb n="1008" />
            </lg>
          </said>
          </p>
          <p>  The consciousness of the warm sunny city outside his win- <lb n="1009" />
          dow and the tender tremors with which his father's voice <lb n="1010" />
          festooned the strange sad happy air drove off all the mists of <lb n="1011" />
          the night's ill humour from Stephen's brain. He got up quickly <lb n="1012" />
          to dress and, when the song had ended, said: <lb n="1013" />
           <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;That's much prettier than any of your other <emph>come-all-yous</emph>. <lb n="1014" /> </said>
           <said who="Simon Dedalus">&#8213;Do you think so? asked Mr Dedalus. <lb n="1015" /> </said>
           <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;I like it, said Stephen. <lb n="1016" /> </said>
           <said who="Simon Dedalus">&#8213;It's a pretty old air, said Mr Dedalus, twirling the points of <lb n="1017" />
          his moustache. Ah, but you should have heard Mick Lacy sing <lb n="1018" />
          it! Poor Mick Lacy! He had little turns for it, grace notes he <lb n="1019" />
          used to put in that I haven't got. That was the boy }omit{ could sing a <lb n="1020" />
          <emph>come-all-you</emph>, if you like. <lb n="1021" /></said> </p>
          <p>  Mr Dedalus had ordered drisheens for breakfast and during <lb n="1022" />
          the meal he crossexamined the waiter for local news. For the <lb n="1023" />
          most part they spoke at cross purposes when a name was <lb n="1024" />
          mentioned, the waiter having in mind its present holder and Mr <lb n="1025" />
          Dedalus his father or perhaps his grandfather. <lb n="1026" />
           <said who="Simon Dedalus">&#8213;Well, I hope they haven't moved the Queen's College any- <lb n="1027" />
          how, said Mr Dedalus, for I want to show it to this youngster <lb n="1028" />
          of mine. <lb n="1029" /></said> </p>
          <p>  Along the Mardyke the trees were in bloom. They entered <lb n="1030" />
          the grounds of the college and were led by the garrulous porter <lb n="1031" />
          across the quadrangle. But their progress across the gravel was <lb n="1032" />
          brought to a halt after  every dozen or so paces by some reply of <lb n="1033" />
          the porter's. <lb n="1034" />
           <said who="Simon Dedalus">&#8213;Ah, do you tell me so? And is poor Pottlebelly dead? <lb n="1035" /> </said>
           <said who="porter">&#8213;Yes, sir. Dead, sir. <lb n="1036" /></said> </p>
          <p>  During these halts Stephen stood awkwardly behind the two <lb n="1037" />
          men, weary of the subject and waiting restlessly for the slow <lb n="1038" />
          march to begin again. By the time they had crossed the quad- <lb n="1039" />
          rangle his restlessness had risen to fever. He wondered how his <lb n="1040" />
          father, whom he knew for a shrewd suspicious man, could be <lb n="1041" />
          duped by the servile manners of the porter: and the lively <lb n="1042" />
          southern speech which had entertained him all the morning <lb n="1043" />
          now irritated his ears.<lb n="1044" /> </p>
          <p>  They passed into the anatomy theatre where Mr Dedalus, <lb n="1045" />
          the porter aiding him, searched the desks for his initials. Ste- <lb n="1046" />
          phen remained in the background, depressed more than ever by <lb n="1047" />
          the darkness and silence of the theatre and by the air it wore of <lb n="1048" />
          jaded and formal study. On the desk before him he read the <lb n="1049" />
          word <emph>Foetus</emph>  cut several times in the dark stained wood. The <lb n="1050" />
          sudden legend startled his blood: he seemed to feel the absent <lb n="1051" />
          students of the college about him and to shrink from their <lb n="1052" />
          company. A vision of their life, which his father's words had <lb n="1053" />
          been powerless to evoke, sprang up before him out of the word <lb n="1054" />
          cut in the desk. A broadshouldered student with a moustache <lb n="1055" />
          was cutting in the letters with a jackknife, seriously. Other <lb n="1056" />
          students stood or sat near him laughing at his handiwork. One <lb n="1057" />
          jogged his elbow. The big student turned on him, frowning. He <lb n="1058" />
          was dressed in loose grey clothes and had tan boots.<lb n="1059" /> </p>
          <p>  Stephen's name was called. He hurried down the steps of the <lb n="1060" />
          theatre so as to be as far away from the vision as he could be <lb n="1061" />
          and, peering closely at his father's initials, hid his flushed face.<lb n="1062" /> </p>
          <p>  But the word and the vision capered before his eyes as he <lb n="1063" />
          walked back across the quadrangle and towards the college <lb n="1064" />
          gate. It shocked him to find in the outer world a trace of what <lb n="1065" />
          he had deemed till then a brutish and individual malady of his <lb n="1066" />
          own mind. His recent monstrous reveries came thronging into <lb n="1067" />
          his memory. They too had sprung up before him, suddenly and <lb n="1068" />
          furiously, out of mere words. He had soon given in to them and <lb n="1069" />
          allowed them to sweep across and abase his intellect, wonder- <lb n="1070" />
          ing always where they came from, from what den of monstrous <lb n="1071" />
          images, and always weak and humble towards others, restless <lb n="1072" />
          and sickened of himself when they had swept over him. <lb n="1073" />
           <said who="Simon Dedalus">&#8213;Ay, bedad! And there's the Groceries sure enough! cried Mr <lb n="1074" />
          Dedalus. You often heard me speak of the Groceries, didn't <lb n="1075" />
          you, Stephen. Many's the time we went down there when our <lb n="1076" />
          names had been marked, a crowd of us, Harry Peard and little <lb n="1077" />
          Jack Mountain and Bob Dyas and Maurice Moriarty, the <lb n="1078" />
          Frenchman, and Tom O'Grady and Mick Lacy that I told you <lb n="1079" />
          of this morning and Joey Corbet and poor little goodhearted <lb n="1080" />
          Johnny Keevers of the Tantiles. <lb n="1081" /></said> </p>
          <p>  The leaves of the trees along the Mardyke were astir and <lb n="1082" />
          whispering in the sunlight. A team of cricketers passed, agile <lb n="1083" />
          young men in flannels and blazers, one of them carrying the <lb n="1084" />
          long green wicketbag. In a quiet bystreet a German band of five <lb n="1085" />
          players in faded uniforms and with battered brass instruments <lb n="1086" />
          was playing to an audience of street arabs and leisurely mess- <lb n="1087" />
          enger boys. A maid in a white cap and apron was watering a <lb n="1088" />
          box of plants on a sill which shone like a slab of limestone in <lb n="1089" />
          the warm glare. From another window open to the air came the <lb n="1090" />
          sound of a piano, scale after scale rising into the treble.<lb n="1091" /> </p>
          <p>  Stephen walked on at his father's side, listening to stories he <lb n="1092" />
          had heard before, hearing again the names of the scattered and <lb n="1093" />
          dead revellers who had been the companions of his father's <lb n="1094" />
          youth. And a faint sickness sighed in his heart. He recalled his <lb n="1095" />
          own equivocal position in Belvedere, a free boy, a leader afraid <lb n="1096" />
          of his own authority, proud and sensitive and suspicious, bat- <lb n="1097" />
          tling against the squalor of his life and against the riot of his <lb n="1098" />
          mind. The letters cut in the stained wood of the desk stared <lb n="1099" />
          upon him, mocking his bodily weakness and futile enthusiasms <lb n="1100" />
          and making him loathe himself for his own mad and filthy <lb n="1101" />
          orgies. The spittle in his throat grew bitter and foul to swallow <lb n="1102" />
          and the faint sickness climbed to his brain so that for a moment <lb n="1103" />
          he closed his eyes and walked on in darkness.<lb n="1104" /> </p>
          <p>  He could still hear his father's voice. <lb n="1105" />
           <said who="Simon Dedalus">&#8213;When you kick out for yourself, Stephen, }omit{ (as I daresay you <lb n="1106" />
          will one of those days) }omit{ remember, whatever you do, to mix <lb n="1107" />
          with gentlemen. When I was a young fellow I tell you I enjoyed <lb n="1108" />
          myself. I mixed with fine decent fellows. Everyone of us could <lb n="1109" />
          do something. One fellow had a good voice, another fellow <lb n="1110" />
          was a good actor, another could sing a good comic song, an- <lb n="1111" />
          other was a good oarsman or a good racketplayer, another <lb n="1112" />
          could tell a good story and so on. We kept the ball rolling <lb n="1113" />
          anyhow and enjoyed ourselves and saw a bit of life and we <lb n="1114" />
          were none the worse of it either. But we were all gentlemen, <lb n="1115" />
          Stephen, (at least I hope we were) }omit{ and bloody good honest <lb n="1116" />
          Irishmen too. That's the kind of fellows I want you to associate <lb n="1117" />
          with, fellows of the right kidney. I'm talking to you as a friend, <lb n="1118" />
          Stephen. I don't believe in playing the stern father. I don't <lb n="1119" />
          believe a son should be afraid of his father. No, I treat you as <lb n="1120" />
          your grandfather treated me when I was a young chap. We <lb n="1121" />
          were more like brothers than father and son. I'll never forget <lb n="1122" />
          the first day he caught me smoking. I was standing at the end <lb n="1123" />
          of the South Terrace one day with some maneens like myself <lb n="1124" />
          and sure we thought we were grand fellows because we had <lb n="1125" />
          pipes stuck in the corners of our mouths. Suddenly the gov- <lb n="1126" />
          ernor passed. He didn't say a word or stop even. But the next <lb n="1127" />
          day, Sunday, we were out for a walk together and when we <lb n="1128" />
          were coming home he took out his cigar case and said: <emph>By the <lb n="1129" />
          bye, Simon, I didn't know you smoked:</emph> or something like that. <lb n="1130" />
          &#8211; Of course I tried to carry it off as best I could. <emph>If you want a <lb n="1131" />
          good smoke</emph>, he said, <emph>try one of these cigars. An American <lb n="1132" />
          captain made me a present of them last night in Queenstown</emph>. <lb n="1133" /></said> </p>
          <p>  Stephen heard his father's voice break into a laugh which <lb n="1134" />
          was almost a sob. <lb n="1135" />
           <said who="Simon Dedalus">&#8213;He was the handsomest man in Cork at that time, by God he <lb n="1136" />
          was! The women used to stand to look after him in the street. <lb n="1137" /></said> </p>
          <p>  He heard the sob passing loudly down his father's throat <lb n="1138" />
          and opened his eyes with a nervous impulse. The sunlight <lb n="1139" />
          breaking suddenly on his sight turned the sky and clouds into a <lb n="1140" />
          fantastic world of sombre masses with lakelike spaces of dark <lb n="1141" />
          rosy light. His very brain was sick and powerless. He could <lb n="1142" />
          scarcely interpret the letters of the signboards of the shops. By <lb n="1143" />
          his monstrous way of life he seemed to have put himself be- <lb n="1144" />
          yond the limits of reality. Nothing moved him or spoke to him <lb n="1145" />
          from the real world unless he heard in it an echo of the <lb n="1146" />
          infuriated cries within him. He could respond to no earthly or <lb n="1147" />
          human appeal, dumb and insensible to the call of summer and <lb n="1148" />
          gladness and companionship, wearied and dejected by his fa- <lb n="1149" />
          ther's voice. He could scarcely recognise as his his own <lb n="1150" />
          thoughts, and repeated slowly to himself:<lb n="1151" /> </p>
          <p> &#8213;I am Stephen Dedalus. I am walking beside my father whose <lb n="1152" />
          name is Simon Dedalus. We are in Cork, in Ireland. Cork is a <lb n="1153" />
          city. Our room is in the Victoria Hotel. Victoria and Stephen <lb n="1154" />
          and Simon. Simon and Stephen and Victoria. Names.<lb n="1155" /> </p>
          <p>  The memory of his childhood suddenly grew dim. He tried <lb n="1156" />
          to call forth some of its vivid moments but could not. He <lb n="1157" />
          recalled only names: Dante, Parnell, Clane, <place><location><geo>53.310770, -6.684719</geo></location><placeName>Clongowes</placeName></place>. A little <lb n="1158" />
          boy had been taught geography by an old woman who kept <lb n="1159" />
          two brushes in her wardrobe. Then he had been sent away <lb n="1160" />
          from home to a college. In the college he had made his first <lb n="1161" />
          communion and eaten slim jim out of his cricket cap and <lb n="1162" />
          watched the firelight leaping and dancing on the wall of a little <lb n="1163" />
          bedroom in the infirmary and dreamed of being dead, of mass <lb n="1164" />
          being said for him by the rector in a black and gold cope, of <lb n="1165" />
          being buried then in the little graveyard of the community off <lb n="1166" />
          the main avenue of limes. But he had not died then. Parnell had <lb n="1167" />
          died. There had been no mass for the dead in the chapel and no <lb n="1168" />
          procession. He had not died but he had faded out like a film in <lb n="1169" />
          the sun. He had been lost or had wandered out of existence for <lb n="1170" />
          he no longer existed. How strange to think of him passing out <lb n="1171" />
          of existence in such a way, not by death but by fading out in <lb n="1172" />
          the sun or by being lost and forgotten somewhere in the uni- <lb n="1173" />
          verse! It was strange to see his small body appear again for a <lb n="1174" />
          moment: a little boy in a grey belted suit. His hands were in his <lb n="1175" />
          sidepockets and his trousers were tucked in at the  knees by <lb n="1176" />
          elastic bands.<lb n="1177" /> </p>
          <p>  On the evening of the day on which the property was sold <lb n="1178" />
          Stephen followed his father meekly about the city from bar to <lb n="1179" />
          bar. To the sellers in the market, to the barmen and barmaids, <lb n="1180" />
          to the beggars who importuned him for a lob Mr Dedalus told <lb n="1181" />
          the same tale, that he was an old Corkonian, that he had been <lb n="1182" />
          trying for thirty years to get rid of his Cork accent up in Dublin <lb n="1183" />
          and that Peter Pickackafox beside him was his eldest son but <lb n="1184" />
          that he was only a Dublin jackeen.<lb n="1185" /> </p>
          <p>  They had set out early in the morning from Newcombe's <lb n="1186" />
          coffeehouse where Mr Dedalus' cup had rattled noisily against <lb n="1187" />
          its saucer and Stephen had tried to cover that shameful sign of <lb n="1188" />
          his father's drinkingbout of the night before by moving his <lb n="1189" />
          chair and coughing. One humiliation had succeeded another: <lb n="1190" />
          the false smiles of the market sellers, the curvettings and <lb n="1191" />
          oglings of the barmaids with whom his father flirted, the com- <lb n="1192" />
          pliments and encouraging words of his father's friends. They <lb n="1193" />
          had told him that he had a great look of his grandfather and <lb n="1194" />
          Mr Dedalus had agreed that he was an ugly likeness. They had <lb n="1195" />
          unearthed traces of a Cork accent in his speech and made him <lb n="1196" />
          admit that the Lee was a much finer river than the Liffey. One <lb n="1197" />
          of them in order to put his Latin to the proof had made him <lb n="1198" />
          translate short passages from Dilectus and asked him whether <lb n="1199" />
          it was correct to say: <seg xml:lang="la">Tempora mutantur nos et mutamur in illis</seg> <lb n="1200" />
          or <seg xml:lang="la">Tempora mutantur et nos mutamur in illis</seg>. Another, a brisk <lb n="1201" />
          old man, whom Mr Dedalus called Johnny Cashman, had <lb n="1202" />
          covered him with confusion by asking him to say which were <lb n="1203" />
          prettier, the Dublin girls or the Cork girls. <lb n="1204" />
           <said who="Simon Dedalus">&#8213;He's not that way built, said Mr Dedalus. Leave him alone. <lb n="1205" />
          He's a levelheaded thinking boy who doesn't bother his head <lb n="1206" />
          about that kind of nonsense. <lb n="1207" /> </said>
           <said who="little old man">&#8213;Then he's not his father's son, said the little old man. <lb n="1208" /> </said>
           <said who="Simon Dedalus">&#8213;I don't know, I'm sure, said Mr Dedalus, smiling com- <lb n="1209" />
          placently.<lb n="1210" /> </said>
           <said who="little old man">&#8213;Your father, said the little old man to Stephen, was the <lb n="1211" />
          boldest flirt in the city of Cork in his day. Do you know that? <lb n="1212" /></said> </p>
          <p>  Stephen looked down and studied the tiled floor of the bar <lb n="1213" />
          into which they had drifted. <lb n="1214" />
           <said who="Simon Dedalus">&#8213;Now don't be putting ideas into his head, said Mr Dedalus. <lb n="1215" />
          Leave him to his Maker. <lb n="1216" /> </said>
           <said who="little old man">&#8213;Yerra, sure I wouldn't put any ideas into his head. I'm old <lb n="1217" />
          enough to be his grandfather. And I am a grandfather, said the <lb n="1218" />
          little old man to Stephen. Do you know that? <lb n="1219" /> </said>
           <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;Are you? asked Stephen. <lb n="1220" /> </said>
           <said who="little old man">&#8213;Bedad I am, said the little old man. I have two bouncing <lb n="1221" />
          grandchildren out at Sunday's Well. Now then! What age do <lb n="1222" />
          you think I am? And I remember seeing your grandfather in his <lb n="1223" />
          red coat riding out to hounds. That was before you were born. <lb n="1224" /> </said>
           <said who="Simon Dedalus">&#8213;Ay, or thought of, said Mr Dedalus. <lb n="1225" /> </said>
           <said who="little old man">&#8213;Bedad I did! repeated the little old man. And, more than <lb n="1226" />
          that, I can remember even your greatgrandfather, old John Ste- <lb n="1227" />
          phen Dedalus, and a fierce old fireeater he was. Now then! <lb n="1228" />
          There's a memory for you! <lb n="1229" /> </said>
           <said who="another of the company">&#8213;That's three generations - four generations, said another of <lb n="1230" />
          the company. Why, Johnny Cashman, you must be nearing the <lb n="1231" />
          century.<lb n="1232" /> </said>
           <said who="little old man">&#8213;Well, I'll tell you the truth, said the little old man. I'm just <lb n="1233" />
          twentyseven years of age. <lb n="1234" /> </said>
           <said who="Simon Dedalus">&#8213;We're as old as we feel, Johnny, said Mr Dedalus. And just <lb n="1235" />
          finish what you have there and we'll have another. Here, Tim <lb n="1236" />
          or Tom or whatever your name is, give us the same again here. <lb n="1237" />
          By God, I don't feel more than eighteen myself. There's that <lb n="1238" />
          son of mine there not half my age and I'm a better man than he <lb n="1239" />
          is any day of the week. <lb n="1240" /> </said>
           <said who="another of the company">&#8213;Draw it mild now, Dedalus. I think it's about time for you to <lb n="1241" />
          take a back seat, said the gentleman who had spoken before. <lb n="1242" /> </said>
           <said who="Simon Dedalus">&#8213;No, by God! asserted Mr Dedalus. I'll sing a tenor song <lb n="1243" />
          against him or I'll vault a fivebarred gate against him or I'll run <lb n="1244" />
          with him after the hounds across the country as I did thirty <lb n="1245" />
          years ago along with the Kerry Boy and the best man for it. <lb n="1246" /> </said>
           <said who="little old man">&#8213;But he'll beat you here, said the little old man, tapping his <lb n="1247" />
          forehead and raising his glass to drain it. <lb n="1248" /> </said>
           <said who="Simon Dedalus">&#8213;Well, I hope he'll be as good a man as his father. That's all I <lb n="1249" />
          can say, said Mr Dedalus. <lb n="1250" /> </said>
           <said who="little old man">&#8213;If he is, he'll do, said the little old man. <lb n="1251" /> </said>
           <said who="Simon Dedalus">&#8213;And thanks be to God, Johnny, said Mr Dedalus, that we <lb n="1252" />
          lived so long and did so little harm. <lb n="1253" /> </said>
           <said who="little old man">&#8213;But did so much good, Simon, said the little old man <lb n="1254" />
          gravely. Thanks be to God we lived so long and did so much <lb n="1255" />
          good.<lb n="1256" /></said> </p>
          <p>  Stephen watched the three glasses being raised from the <lb n="1257" />
          counter as his father and his two cronies drank to the memory <lb n="1258" />
          of their past. An abyss of fortune or of temperament sundered <lb n="1259" />
          him from them. His mind seemed older than theirs: it shone <lb n="1260" />
          coldly on their strifes and happiness and regrets like a moon <lb n="1261" />
          upon a younger earth. No life or youth stirred in him as it had <lb n="1262" />
          stirred in them. He had known neither the pleasure of compan- <lb n="1263" />
          ionship with others nor the vigour of rude male health nor filial <lb n="1264" />
          piety. Nothing stirred within his soul but a cold and cruel and <lb n="1265" />
          loveless lust. His childhood was dead or lost and with it his <lb n="1266" />
          soul capable of simple joys: and he was drifting amid life like <lb n="1267" />
          the barren shell of the moon.<lb n="1268" /> </p>
          <lg>
             <l>Art thou pale for weariness </l> <lb n="1269" />
             <l>Of climbing heaven and gazing on the earth </l> <lb n="1270" />
             <l>Wandering companionless ....?</l> <lb n="1271" />
          </lg>
          <p>  He repeated to himself the lines of Shelley's fragment. Its <lb n="1272" />
          alternation of sad human ineffectiveness with vast inhuman <lb n="1273" />
          cycles of activity chilled him: and he forgot his own human and <lb n="1274" />
          ineffectual grieving.<lb n="1275" /> </p>

        <div n="2.5" type="section">
          <p>  Stephen's mother and his brother and one of his cousins <lb n="1276" />
          waited at the corner of quiet Foster Place while he and his <lb n="1277" />
          father went up the steps and along the colonnade where the <lb n="1278" />
          highland sentry was parading. When they had passed into the <lb n="1279" />
          great hall and stood at the counter Stephen drew forth his <lb n="1280" />
          orders on the governor of the bank of Ireland for thirty and <lb n="1281" />
          three pounds; and these sums, the moneys of his exhibition and <lb n="1282" />
          essay prize, were paid over to him rapidly by the teller in notes <lb n="1283" />
          and in coin respectively. He bestowed them in his pockets with <lb n="1284" />
          feigned composure and suffered the friendly teller, to whom his <lb n="1285" />
          father chatted, to take his hand across the broad counter and <lb n="1286" />
          wish him a brilliant career in after life. He was impatient of <lb n="1287" />
          their voices and could not keep his feet at rest. But the teller <lb n="1288" />
          still deferred the serving of others to say that he was living in <lb n="1289" />
          changed times and that there was nothing like giving a boy the <lb n="1290" />
          best education that money could buy. Mr Dedalus lingered in <lb n="1291" />
          the hall gazing about him and up at the roof and telling Ste- <lb n="1292" />
          phen, who urged him to come out, that they were standing in <lb n="1293" />
          the house of commons of the old Irish parliament. <lb n="1294" />
           <said who="Simon Dedalus">&#8213;God help us! he said piously. To think of the men of those <lb n="1295" />
          times, Stephen, Hely Hutchinson and Flood and Henry Grattan <lb n="1296" />
          and Charles Kendal Bushe, and the noblemen we have now, <lb n="1297" />
          leaders of the Irish people at home and abroad. Why, by God, <lb n="1298" />
          they wouldn't be seen dead in a ten acre field with them. No, <lb n="1299" />
          Stephen, old chap, I'm sorry to say that they are only as I roved <lb n="1300" />
          out one fine May morning in the merry month of sweet July. <lb n="1301" /></said> </p>
          <p>  A keen October wind was blowing round the bank. The <lb n="1302" />
          three figures standing at the edge of the muddy path had <lb n="1303" />
          pinched cheeks and watery eyes. Stephen looked at his thinly <lb n="1304" />
          clad mother and remembered that a few days before he had <lb n="1305" />
          seen a mantle priced at twenty guineas in the window of Bar- <lb n="1306" />
          nardo's. <lb n="1307" />
           <said who="Simon Dedalus">&#8213;Well that's done, said Mr Dedalus. <lb n="1398" /> </said>
           <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;We had better go to dinner, said Stephen. Where? <lb n="1309" /> </said>
           <said who="Simon Dedalus">&#8213;Dinner? said Mr Dedalus. Well, I suppose we had better, <lb n="1310" />
          what?<lb n="1311" /> </said>
           <said who="Mary Dedalus">&#8213;Some place that's not too dear, said Mrs Dedalus. <lb n="1312" /> </said>
           <said who="Simon Dedalus">&#8213;Underdone's?<lb n="1313" /> </said>
           <said who="Mary Dedalus">&#8213;Yes. Some quiet place. <lb n="1314" /> </said>
           <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;Come along, said Stephen quickly. It doesn't matter about <lb n="1315" />
          the dearness. <lb n="1316" /></said> </p>
          <p>  He walked on before them with short nervous steps, smiling. <lb n="1317" />
          They tried to keep up with him, smiling also at his eagerness. <lb n="1318" />
           <said who="Simon Dedalus">&#8213;Take it easy like a good young fellow, said his father. We're <lb n="1319" />
          not out for the half mile, are we? <lb n="1320" /></said> </p>
          <p>  For a swift season of merrymaking the money of his prizes <lb n="1321" />
          ran through Stephen's  fingers. Great parcels of groceries and <lb n="1322" />
          delicacies and dried fruits arrived from the city. Every day he <lb n="1323" />
          drew up a bill of fare for the family and every night led a party <lb n="1324" />
          of three or four to the theatre to see <emph>Ingomar</emph> or <emph>The Lady of <lb n="1325" />
          Lyons</emph>. In his coat pockets he carried squares of Vienna choc- <lb n="1326" />
          olate for his guests while his trousers' pockets bulged with <lb n="1327" />
          masses of silver and copper coins. He bought presents for <lb n="1328" />
          everyone, overhauled his room, wrote out resolutions, marshal- <lb n="1329" />
          led his books up and down their shelves, pored upon all kinds <lb n="1330" />
          of price lists, drew up a form of commonwealth for the <lb n="1331" />
          household by which every member of it held some office, <lb n="1332" />
          opened a loan bank for his family and pressed loans on willing <lb n="1333" />
          borrowers so that he might have the pleasure of making out <lb n="1334" />
          receipts and reckoning the interests on the sums lent. When he <lb n="1335" />
          could do no more he drove up and down the city in trams. <lb n="1336" />
          Then the season of pleasure came to an end. The pot of pink <lb n="1337" />
          enamel paint gave out and the wainscot of his bedroom re- <lb n="1338" />
          mained with its unfinished and illplastered coat.<lb n="1339" /> </p>
          <p>  His household returned to its usual way of life. His mother <lb n="1340" />
          had no further occasion to upbraid him for squandering his <lb n="1341" />
          money. He too returned to his old life at school and all his <lb n="1342" />
          novel enterprises fell to pieces. The commonwealth fell, the <lb n="1343" />
          loan bank closed its coffers and its books on a sensible loss, the <lb n="1344" />
          rules of life which he had drawn about himself fell into desue- <lb n="1345" />
          tude.<lb n="1346" /> </p>
          <p>  How foolish his aim had been! He had tried to build a <lb n="1347" />
          breakwater of order and elegance against the sordid tide of life <lb n="1348" />
          without him and to dam up, by rules of conduct and active <lb n="1349" />
          interests and new filial relations, the powerful recurrence of the <lb n="1350" />
          tides within him. Useless. From without as from within the <lb n="1351" />
          waters had flowed over his barriers: their tides began once <lb n="1352" />
          more to jostle fiercely above the crumbled mole.<lb n="1353" /> </p>
          <p>  He saw clearly too his own futile isolation. He had not gone <lb n="1354" />
          one step nearer the lives he had sought to approach nor bridged <lb n="1355" />
          the restless shame and rancour that divided him from father <lb n="1356" />
          and mother and brother and sister. He felt that he was hardly <lb n="1357" />
          of the one blood with them but stood to them rather in the <lb n="1358" />
          mystical kinship of fosterage, fosterchild and fosterbrother.<lb n="1359" /> </p>
          <p>  He burned to appease the fierce longings of his heart before <lb n="1360" />
          which everything else was idle and alien. He cared little that he <lb n="1361" />
          was in mortal sin, that his life had grown to be a tissue of <lb n="1362" />
          subterfuges and falsehood. Beside the savage desire within him <lb n="1363" />
          to realise the enormities which he brooded on nothing was <lb n="1364" />
          sacred. He bore cynically with the shameful details of his secret <lb n="1365" />
          riots in which he exulted to defile with patience whatever im- <lb n="1366" />
          age had attracted his eyes. By day and by night he moved <lb n="1367" />
          among distorted images of the outer world. A figure that had <lb n="1368" />
          seemed to him by day demure and innocent  came towards him <lb n="1369" />
          by night through the winding darkness of sleep, her face trans- <lb n="1370" />
          figured by a lecherous cunning, her eyes bright with brutish <lb n="1371" />
          joy. Only the morning pained him with its dim memory of dark <lb n="1372" />
          orgiastic riot, its keen and humiliating sense of transgression.<lb n="1373" /> </p>
          <p>  He returned to his wanderings. The veiled autumnal even- <lb n="1374" />
          ings led him from street to street as they had led him years <lb n="1375" />
          before along the quiet avenues of Blackrock. But no vision of <lb n="1376" />
          trim front gardens or of kindly lights in the windows poured a <lb n="1377" />
          tender influence upon him now. Only at times, in the pauses of <lb n="1378" />
          his desire, when the luxury that was wasting him gave room to <lb n="1379" />
          a softer languor, the image of Mercedes traversed the back- <lb n="1380" />
          ground of his memory. He saw again the small white house and <lb n="1381" />
          the garden of rosebushes on the road that led to the mountains <lb n="1382" />
          and he remembered the sadly proud gesture of refusal which he <lb n="1383" />
          was to make there, standing with her in the moonlit garden <lb n="1384" />
          after years of estrangement and adventure. At those moments <lb n="1385" />
          the soft speeches of Claude Melnotte rose to his lips and eased <lb n="1386" />
          his unrest. A tender premonition touched him of the tryst he <lb n="1387" />
          had then looked forward to and, in spite of the horrible reality <lb n="1388" />
          which lay between his hope of then and now, of the holy <lb n="1389" />
          encounter he had then imagined at which weakness and timid- <lb n="1390" />
          ity and inexperience were to fall from him.<lb n="1391" /> </p>
          <p>  Such moments passed and the wasting fires of lust sprang up <lb n="1392" />
          again. The verses passed from his lips and the inarticulate cries <lb n="1393" />
          and the unspoken brutal words rushed forth from his brain to <lb n="1394" />
          force a passage. His blood was in revolt. He wandered up and <lb n="1395" />
          down the dark slimy streets peering into the gloom of lanes and <lb n="1396" />
          doorways, listening eagerly for any sound. He moaned to him- <lb n="1397" />
          self like some baffled prowling beast. He wanted to sin with <lb n="1398" />
          another of his kind, to force another being to sin with him and <lb n="1399" />
          to exult with her in sin. He felt some dark presence moving <lb n="1400" />
          irresistibly upon him from the  darkness, a presence subtle and <lb n="1401" />
          murmurous as a flood filling him wholly with itself. Its mur- <lb n="1402" />
          mur besieged his ears like the murmur of some multitude in <lb n="1403" />
          sleep; its subtle streams penetrated his being. His hands <lb n="1404" />
          clenched convulsively and his teeth set together as he suffered <lb n="1405" />
          the agony of its penetration. He stretched out his arms in the <lb n="1406" />
          street to hold fast the frail swooning form that eluded him and <lb n="1407" />
          incited him: and the cry that he had strangled for so long in his <lb n="1408" />
          throat issued from his lips. It broke from him like a wail of <lb n="1409" />
          despair from a hell of sufferers and died in a wail of furious <lb n="1410" />
          entreaty, a cry for an iniquitous abandonment, a cry which was <lb n="1411" />
          but the echo of an obscene scrawl which he had read on the <lb n="1412" />
          oozing wall of a urinal.<lb n="1413" /> </p>
          <p>  He had wandered into a maze of narrow and dirty streets. <lb n="1414" />
          From the foul laneways he heard bursts of hoarse riot and <lb n="1415" />
          wrangling and the drawling of drunken singers. He walked <lb n="1416" />
          onward, undismayed, wondering whether he had strayed into <lb n="1417" />
          the quarter of the jews. Women and girls dressed in long vivid <lb n="1418" />
          gowns traversed the street from house to house. They were <lb n="1419" />
          leisurely and perfumed. A trembling seized him and his eyes <lb n="1420" />
          grew dim. The yellow gasflames arose before his troubled vi- <lb n="1421" />
          sion against the vapoury sky, burning as if before an altar. <lb n="1422" />
          Before the doors and in the lighted halls groups were gathered, <lb n="1423" />
          arrayed as for some rite. He was in another world: he had <lb n="1424" />
          awakened from a slumber of centuries.<lb n="1425" /> </p>
          <p>  He stood still in the middle of the roadway, his heart clam- <lb n="1426" />
          ouring against his bosom in a tumult. A young woman dressed <lb n="1427" />
          in a long pink gown laid her hand on his arm to detain him and <lb n="1428" />
          gazed into his face. She said gaily: <lb n="1429" />
           <said who="prostitute">&#8213;Good night, Willie dear! <lb n="1430" /></said> </p>
          <p>  Her room was warm and lightsome. A huge doll sat with her <lb n="1431" />
          legs apart in the copious easychair beside the bed. He tried to <lb n="1432" />
          bid his tongue speak that he might seem at ease, watching her <lb n="1433" />
          as she undid her gown, noting the proud conscious movements <lb n="1434" />
          of her perfumed head.<lb n="1435" /> </p>
          <p>  As he stood silent in the middle of the room she came over <lb n="1436" />
          to him and embraced him gaily and gravely. Her round arms <lb n="1437" />
          held him firmly to her and he, seeing her face lifted to him in <lb n="1438" />
          serious calm and feeling the warm calm rise and fall of her <lb n="1439" />
          breast, all but burst into hysterical weeping. Tears of joy and <lb n="1440" />
          relief shone in his delighted eyes and his lips parted though they <lb n="1441" />
          would not speak.<lb n="1442" /> </p>
          <p>  She passed her tinkling hand through his hair, calling him a <lb n="1443" />
          little rascal. <lb n="1444" />
           <said who="prostitute">&#8213;Give me a kiss, she said. <lb n="1445" /></said> </p>
          <p>  His lips would not bend to kiss her. He wanted to be held <lb n="1446" />
          firmly in her arms, to be caressed slowly, slowly, slowly. In her <lb n="1447" />
          arms he felt that he had suddenly become strong and fearless <lb n="1448" />
          and sure of himself. But his lips would not bend to kiss her.<lb n="1449" /> </p>
          <p>  With a sudden movement she bowed his head and joined her <lb n="1450" />
          lips to his and he read the meaning of her movements in her <lb n="1451" />
          frank uplifted eyes. It was too much for him. He closed his <lb n="1452" />
          eyes, surrendering himself to her, body and mind, conscious of <lb n="1453" />
          nothing in the world but the dark pressure of her softly parting <lb n="1454" />
          lips. They pressed upon his brain as upon his lips as though <lb n="1455" />
          they were the vehicle of a vague speech; and between them he <lb n="1456" />
          felt an unknown and timid pressure, darker than the swoon of <lb n="1457" />
          sin, softer than sound or odour.<lb n="1458" /> </p>

          <p> The swift December dusk had come tumbling clownishly after <lb n="1" />
          its dull day and as he stared through the dull square of the <lb n="2" />
          window of the schoolroom he felt his belly crave for its food. <lb n="3" />
          He hoped there would be stew for dinner, turnips and carrots <lb n="4" />
          and bruised potatoes and fat mutton pieces to be ladled out in <lb n="5" />
          thick peppered flourfattened sauce. Stuff it into you, his belly <lb n="6" />
          counselled him.<lb n="7" /> </p>
          <p> It would be a gloomy secret night. After early nightfall the <lb n="8" />
          yellow lamps would light up here and there the squalid quarter <lb n="9" />
          of the brothels. He would follow a devious course up and down <lb n="10" />
          the streets, circling always nearer and nearer in a tremor of fear <lb n="11" />
          and joy, until his feet led him suddenly round a dark corner. <lb n="12" />
          The whores would be just coming out of their houses making <lb n="13" />
          ready for the night, yawning lazily after their sleep and settling <lb n="14" />
          the hairpins in their clusters of hair. He would pass by them <lb n="15" />
          calmly waiting for a sudden movement of his own will or a <lb n="16" />
          sudden call to his sinloving soul from their soft perfumed flesh. <lb n="17" />
          Yet as he prowled in quest of that call his senses, stultified only <lb n="18" />
          by his desire, would note keenly all that wounded and shamed <lb n="19" />
          them, his eyes a ring of porter froth on a clothless table or a <lb n="20" />
          photograph of two soldiers standing to attention or a gaudy <lb n="21" />
          playbill, his ears the drawling jargon of greeting: <lb n="22" />
           <said who="a whore">&#8213;Hello, Bertie, any good in your mind?<lb n="23" /> </said>
           <said who="a whore">&#8213;Is that you, pigeon?<lb n="24" /> </said>
           <said who="a whore">&#8213;Number ten. Fresh Nelly is waiting on you.<lb n="25" /> </said>
           <said who="a whore">&#8213;Goodnight, husband! Coming in to have a short time?<lb n="26" /></said> </p>
          <p> The equation on the page of his scribbler began to spread <lb n="27" />
          out a widening tail, eyed and starred like a peacock's: and <lb n="28" />
          when the eyes and stars of its indices had been eliminated be- <lb n="29" />
          gan slowly to fold itself together again. The indices appearing <lb n="30" />
          and disappearing were eyes opening and closing; the eyes <lb n="31" />
          opening and closing were stars being born and being quenched. <lb n="32" />
          The vast cycle of starry life bore his weary  mind outward to its <lb n="33" />
          verge and inward to its centre, a distant music accompanying <lb n="34" />
          him outward and inward. What music? The music came nearer <lb n="35" />
          and he recalled the words, the words of Shelley's fragment <lb n="36" />
          upon the moon wandering companionless, pale for weariness. <lb n="37" />
          The stars began to crumble and a cloud of fine stardust fell <lb n="38" />
          through space.<lb n="39" /> </p>
          <p> The dull light fell more faintly upon the page whereon an- <lb n="40" />
          other equation began to unfold itself slowly and to spread <lb n="41" />
          abroad its widening tail. It was his own soul going forth to <lb n="42" />
          experience, unfolding itself sin by sin, spreading abroad the <lb n="43" />
          balefire of its burning stars and folding back upon itself, fading <lb n="44" />
          slowly, quenching its own lights and fires. They were <lb n="45" />
          quenched: and the cold darkness filled chaos.<lb n="46" /> </p>
          <p> A cold lucid indifference reigned in his soul. At his first <lb n="47" />
          violent sin he had felt a wave of vitality pass out of him and <lb n="48" />
          had feared to find his body or his soul maimed by the excess. <lb n="49" />
          Instead the vital wave had carried him on its bosom out of <lb n="50" />
          himself and back again when it receded: and no part of body or <lb n="51" />
          soul had been maimed but a dark peace had been established <lb n="52" />
          between them. The chaos in which his ardour extinguished <lb n="53" />
          itself was a cold indifferent knowledge of himself. He had <lb n="54" />
          sinned mortally not once but many times and he knew that, <lb n="55" />
          while he stood in danger of eternal damnation for the first sin <lb n="56" />
          alone, by every succeeding sin he multiplied his guilt and his <lb n="57" />
          punishment. His days and works and thoughts could make no <lb n="58" />
          atonement for him, the fountains of sanctifying grace having <lb n="59" />
          ceased to refresh his soul. At most by an alms given to a <lb n="60" />
          beggar, whose blessing he fled from, he might hope wearily to <lb n="61" />
          win for himself some measure of actual grace. Devotion had <lb n="62" />
          gone by the board. What did it avail to pray when he knew that <lb n="63" />
          his soul lusted after its own destruction? A certain pride, a <lb n="64" />
          certain awe, withheld him from offering to God even one <lb n="65" />
          prayer at night though he knew it was in God's power to take <lb n="66" />
          away his life while he slept and hurl his soul hellward ere he <lb n="67" />
          could beg for mercy. His pride in his own sin, his loveless awe <lb n="68" />
          of God told him that his offence was too grievous to be atoned <lb n="69" />
          for in whole or in part by a false homage to the Allseeing and <lb n="70" />
          Allknowing. <said who="a voice">&#8213;Well now, Ennis, I declare you have a head and so has my <lb n="71" />
          stick! Do you mean to say that you are not able to tell me what <lb n="73" />
          a surd is?<lb n="74" /></said> </p>
          <p> The blundering answer stirred the embers of his contempt of <lb n="75" />
          his fellows. Towards others he felt neither shame nor fear. On <lb n="76" />
          Sunday mornings as he passed the churchdoor he glanced <lb n="77" />
          coldly at the worshippers who stood bareheaded, four deep, <lb n="78" />
          outside the church, morally present at the mass which they <lb n="79" />
          could neither see nor hear. Their dull piety and the sickly smell <lb n="80" />
          of the cheap hairoil with which they had anointed their heads <lb n="81" />
          repelled him from the altar they prayed at. He stooped to the <lb n="82" />
          evil of hypocrisy with others, sceptical of their innocence which <lb n="83" />
          he could cajole so easily.<lb n="84" /> </p>
          <p> On the wall of his bedroom hung an illuminated scroll, the <lb n="85" />
          certificate of his prefecture in the college of the sodality of the <lb n="86" />
          Blessed Virgin Mary. On Saturday mornings when the sodality <lb n="87" />
          met in the chapel to recite the little office his place was a <lb n="88" />
          cushioned kneelingdesk at the right of the altar from which he <lb n="89" />
          led his wing of boys through the responses. The falsehood of <lb n="90" />
          his position did not pain him. If at moments he felt an impulse <lb n="91" />
          to rise from his post of honour and, confessing before them all <lb n="92" />
          his unworthiness, to leave the chapel, a glance at their faces <lb n="93" />
          restrained him. The imagery of the psalms of prophecy soothed <lb n="94" />
          his barren pride. The glories of Mary held his soul captive: <lb n="95" />
          spikenard and myrrh and frankincense, symbolising the <lb n="96" />
          preciousness of God's gifts to her soul, rich garments, symbol- <lb n="97" />
          ising her royal lineage, her emblems, the lateflowering plant <lb n="98" />
          and lateblossoming tree, symbolising the agelong gradual <lb n="99" />
          growth of her cultus among men. When it fell to him to read <lb n="100" />
          the lesson towards the close of the office he read it in a veiled <lb n="101" />
          voice, lulling his conscience to its music:<lb n="102" /> </p>
          <lg>
            <p> <emph>Quasi cedrus exaltata sum in Libanon et quasi cu- <lb n="103" />
            pressus in  monte Sion. Quasi palma exaltata sum in <lb n="104" />
            Gades et quasi  plantatio rosae in Jericho. Quasi uliva <lb n="105" />
            speciosa in campis et  quasi platanus exaltata sum juxta <lb n="106" />
            aquam in plateis. Sicut  cinnamomum et balsamum aro- <lb n="107" />
            matizans odorem dedi et quasi  myrrha electa dedi <lb n="108" />
            suavitatem odoris.</emph><lb n="109" /> </p>
          </lg>
          <p> His sin, which had covered him from the sight of God, had <lb n="110" />
          led him nearer to the refuge of sinners. Her eyes seemed to <lb n="111" />
          regard him with mild pity; her holiness, a strange light glowing <lb n="112" />
          faintly upon her frail flesh, did not humiliate the sinner who <lb n="113" />
          approached her. If ever he was impelled to cast sin from him <lb n="114" />
          and to repent the impulse that moved him was the wish to be <lb n="115" />
          her knight. If ever his soul, reentering her dwelling shyly after <lb n="116" />
          the frenzy of his body's lust had spent itself, was turned to- <lb n="117" />
          wards her whose emblem is the morning star, <emph>bright and</emph> <lb n="118" />
          <emph>musical, telling of heaven and infusing peace</emph>, it was when her <lb n="119" />
          names were murmured softly by lips whereon there still lin- <lb n="120" />
          gered foul and shameful words, the savour itself of a lewd kiss.<lb n="121" /> </p>
          <p> That was strange. He tried to think how it could be but the <lb n="122" />
          dusk, deepening in the schoolroom, covered over his thought. <lb n="123" />
          The bell rang. The master marked the sums and cuts to be done <lb n="124" />
          for the next lesson and went out. Heron, beside Stephen, began <lb n="125" />
          to hum tunelessly:<lb n="126" /> </p>
          <p> <emph>My excellent friend Bombados.</emph> <lb n="127" />
          <p> Ennis, who had gone to the yard, came back, saying: <lb n="128" />
           <said who="Ennis">&#8213;The boy from the house is coming up for the rector.<lb n="129" /></said> </p>
          A tall boy behind Stephen rubbed his hands and said: <lb n="130" />
           <said who="a tall boy">&#8213;That's game ball. We can scut the whole hour. He won't be <lb n="131" />
          in till after half two. Then you can ask him questions on the <lb n="132" />
          catechism, Dedalus.<lb n="133" /></said> </p>
          <p> Stephen, leaning back and drawing idly on his scribbler, <lb n="134" />
          listened to the talk about him which Heron checked from time <lb n="135" />
          to time by saying: <lb n="136" />
           <said who="Vincent Heron">&#8213;Shut up, will you. Don't make such a bally racket!<lb n="137" /></said> </p>
          <p>It was strange too that he found an arid pleasure in follow- <lb n="138" />
          ing up to the end the rigid lines of the doctrines of the church <lb n="139" />
          and penetrating into obscure silences  only to hear and feel the <lb n="140" />
          more deeply his own condemnation. The sentence of saint <lb n="141" />
          James which says that he who offends against one command- <lb n="142" />
          ment becomes guilty of all had seemed to him first a swollen <lb n="143" />
          phrase until he had begun to grope in the darkness of his own <lb n="144" />
          state. From the evil seed of lust all other deadly sins had sprung <lb n="145" />
          forth: pride in himself and contempt of others, covetousness in <lb n="146" />
          using money for the purchase of unlawful pleasure, envy of <lb n="147" />
          those whose vices he could not reach to and calumnious <lb n="148" />
          murmuring against the pious, gluttonous  enjoyment of food, <lb n="149" />
          the dull glowering anger amid which he brooded upon his <lb n="150" />
          longing, the swamp of spiritual and bodily sloth in which his <lb n="151" />
          whole being had sunk.<lb n="152" /> </p>
          <p> As he sat in his bench gazing calmly at the rector's shrewd <lb n="153" />
          harsh face his mind wound itself in and out of the curious <lb n="154" />
          questions proposed to it. If a man had stolen a pound in his <lb n="155" />
          youth and had used that pound to amass a huge fortune how <lb n="156" />
          much was he obliged to give back, the pound he had stolen <lb n="157" />
          only or the pound together with the compound interest accru- <lb n="158" />
          ing upon it or all his huge fortune? If a layman in giving <lb n="159" />
          baptism pour the water before saying the words is the child <lb n="160" />
          baptised? Is baptism with a mineral water valid? How comes it <lb n="161" />
          that while the first beatitude promises the kingdom of heaven <lb n="162" />
          to the poor of heart the second beatitude promises also to the <lb n="163" />
          meek that they shall possess the land? Why was the sacrament <lb n="164" />
          of the eucharist instituted under the two species of bread and <lb n="165" />
          wine if Jesus Christ be present body and blood, soul and divin- <lb n="166" />
          ity, in the bread alone and in the wine alone? Does a tiny <lb n="167" />
          particle of the consecrated bread contain all the body and <lb n="168" />
          blood of Jesus Christ or a part only of the body and blood? If <lb n="169" />
          the wine change into vinegar and the host crumble  into cor- <lb n="170" />
          ruption after they have been consecrated is Jesus Christ still <lb n="171" />
          present under their species as God and as man? <lb n="172" />
           <said who="a boy">&#8213;Here he is! Here he is!<lb n="173" /></said> </p>
          <p> A boy from his post at the window had seen the rector come <lb n="174" />
          from the house. All the catechisms were opened and all heads <lb n="175" />
          bent upon them silently. The rector entered and took his seat <lb n="176" />
          on the dais. A gentle kick from the tall boy in the bench behind <lb n="177" />
          urged Stephen to ask a difficult question.<lb n="178" /> </p>
          <p> The rector did not ask for a catechism to hear the lesson <lb n="179" />
          from. He clasped his hands on the desk and said: <lb n="180" />
           <said who="Father Conmee">&#8213;The retreat will begin on Wednesday afternoon in honour of <lb n="181" />
          saint Francis Xavier whose feast day is Saturday. The retreat <lb n="182" />
          will go on from Wednesday to Friday. On Friday confessions <lb n="183" />
          will be heard all the afternoon after beads. If any boys have <lb n="184" />
          special confessors perhaps it will be better for them not to <lb n="185" />
          change. Mass will be on Saturday morning at nine o'clock and <lb n="186" />
          general communion for the whole college. Saturday will be a <lb n="187" />
          free day. Sunday of course. But Saturday and Sunday being free <lb n="188" />
          days some boys might be inclined to think that Monday is a <lb n="189" />
          free day also. Beware of making that mistake. I think you, <lb n="190" />
          Lawless, are likely to make that mistake.<lb n="191" /> </said>
           <said who="Lawless">&#8213;I, sir? Why,  sir?<lb n="192" /></said> </p>
          <p> A little wave of quiet mirth broke forth over the class of <lb n="193" />
          boys from the rector's grim smile. Stephen's heart began slowly <lb n="194" />
          to fold and fade with fear like a withering flower.<lb n="195" /> </p>
          <p> The rector went on gravely: <lb n="196" />
           <said who="Father Conmee">&#8213;You are all familiar with the story of the life of saint Francis <lb n="197" />
          Xavier, I suppose, the patron of your college. He came of an <lb n="198" />
          old and illustrious Spanish family and you remember that he <lb n="199" />
          was one of the first followers of saint Ignatius. They met in <place><location><geo>48.853157 2.343094</geo></location> <lb n="200" />
          <placeName>Paris</placeName></place> where Francis Xavier was professor of philosophy at the <lb n="201" />
          university. This young and brilliant nobleman and man of let- <lb n="202" />
          ters entered heart and soul into the ideas of our glorious <lb n="203" />
          founder and you know that he, at his own desire, was sent by <lb n="204" />
          saint Ignatius to preach to the Indians. He is called, as you <lb n="205" />
          know, the apostle of the Indies. He went from country to <lb n="206" />
          country in the east, from Africa to India, from India to Japan, <lb n="207" />
          baptising the people. He is said to have baptised as many as ten <lb n="208" />
          thousand idolaters in one month. It is said that his right arm <lb n="209" />
          had grown powerless from having been raised so often over the <lb n="210" />
          heads of those whom he baptised. He wished then to go to <lb n="211" />
          China to win still more souls for God but he died of fever on <lb n="212" />
          the <place><location><geo>21.705010 112.791206</geo></location><placeName>island of Sancian</placeName></place>. A great saint, saint Francis Xavier! A <lb n="213" />
          great soldier of God!<lb n="214" /></said> </p>
          <p> The rector paused and then, shaking his clasped hands be- <lb n="215" />
          fore him, went on: <lb n="216" />
           <said who="Father Conmee">&#8213;He had the faith in him that moves mountains. Ten thou- <lb n="217" />
          sand souls won for God in a single month! That is a true <lb n="218" />
          conqueror, true to the motto of our order <seg xml:lang="la">ad majorem Dei <lb n="219" />
          gloriam</seg>! A saint who has great power in heaven, remember: <lb n="220" />
          power to intercede for us in our grief, power to obtain what- <lb n="221" />
          ever we pray for if it be for the good of our souls, power above <lb n="222" />
          all to obtain for us the grace to repent if we be in sin. A great <lb n="223" />
          saint, saint Francis Xavier! A great fisher of souls!<lb n="224" /></said> </p>
          <p> He ceased to shake his clasped hands and, resting them <lb n="225" />
          against his forehead, looked right and left of them keenly at his <lb n="226" />
          listeners out of his dark stern eyes.<lb n="227" /> </p>
          <p> In the silence their dark fire kindled the dusk into a tawny <lb n="228" />
          glow. Stephen's heart had withered up like a flower of the <lb n="229" />
          desert that feels the simoom  coming from afar.<lb n="230" /> </p>

            <emph>ever</emph> &#8211; words taken, my dear little brothers in Christ, from the <lb n="232" />

            <p> Stephen sat in the front bench of the chapel. Father Arnall <lb n="236" />
            sat at a table to the left of the altar. He wore about his shoul- <lb n="237" />
            ders a heavy cloak; his pale face was drawn and his voice <lb n="238" />
            broken with rheum. The figure of his old master, so strangely <lb n="239" />
            rearisen, brought back to Stephen's mind his life at <place><location><geo>53.310624 -6.684096</geo></location><placeName>Clongowes</placeName></place>: <lb n="240" />
            the wide playgrounds, swarming with boys, the square ditch, <lb n="241" />
            the little cemetery off the main avenue of limes where he had <lb n="242" />
            dreamed of being buried, the firelight on the wall of the infirm- <lb n="243" />
            ary where he lay sick, the sorrowful face of Brother Michael. <lb n="244" />
            His soul, as these memories came back to him, became again a <lb n="245" />
            child's soul. <lb n="246" />
             <said who="Father Arnall">&#8213;We are assembled here today, my dear little brothers in <lb n="247" />
            Christ, for one brief moment far away from the busy bustle of <lb n="248" />
            the outer world to celebrate and to honour one of the greatest <lb n="249" />
            of saints, the apostle of the Indies, the patron saint also of your <lb n="250" />
            college, saint Francis Xavier. Year after year for much longer <lb n="251" />
            than any of you, my dear little boys, can remember or than I <lb n="252" />
            can remember the boys of this college have met in this very <lb n="253" />
            chapel to make their annual retreat before the feast day of their <lb n="254" />
            patron saint. Time has gone on and brought with it its changes. <lb n="255" />
            Even in the last few years what changes can most of you not <lb n="256" />
            remember? Many of the boys who sat in those front benches a <lb n="257" />
            few short years ago are perhaps now in distant lands, in the <lb n="258" />
            burning tropics or immersed in professional duties or in sem- <lb n="259" />
            inaries or voyaging over the vast expanse of the deep or, it may <lb n="260" />
            be, already called by the great God to another life and to the <lb n="261" />
            rendering up of their stewardship. And still as the years roll by, <lb n="262" />
            bringing with them changes for good and bad, the memory of <lb n="263" />
            the great saint is honoured by the boys of his college who make <lb n="264" />
            every year their annual retreat on the days preceding the feast <lb n="265" />
            day set apart by our holy mother  the church to transmit to all <lb n="266" />
            the ages the name and fame of one of the greatest sons of <lb n="267" />
            catholic Spain.<lb n="268" /> </said>
             <said who="Father Arnall">&#8213;Now what is the meaning of this word <emph>retreat</emph> and why is it <lb n="269" />
            allowed on all hands to be a most salutary practice for all who <lb n="270" />
            desire to lead before God and in the eyes of men a truly chris- <lb n="271" />
            tian life? A retreat, my dear boys, signifies a withdrawal for a <lb n="272" />
            while from the cares of our life, the cares of this workaday <lb n="273" />
            world, in order to examine the state of our conscience, to <lb n="274" />
            reflect on the mysteries of holy religion and to understand <lb n="275" />
            better why we are here in this world. During these few days I <lb n="276" />
            intend to put before you some thoughts concerning the four <lb n="277" />
            last things. They are, as you know from your catechism, death, <lb n="278" />
            judgment, hell and heaven. We shall try to understand them <lb n="279" />
            fully during these few days so that we may derive from the <lb n="280" />
            understanding of them a lasting benefit to our souls. And re- <lb n="281" />
            member, my dear boys, that we have been sent into this world <lb n="282" />
            for one thing and for one thing alone: to do God's holy will <lb n="283" />
            and to save our immortal souls. All else is worthless. One thing <lb n="284" />
            alone is needful, the salvation of one's soul. What doth it profit <lb n="285" />
            a man to gain the whole world if he suffer the loss of his <lb n="286" />
            immortal soul? Ah, my dear boys, believe me there is nothing in <lb n="287" />
            this wretched world that can make up for such a loss.<lb n="288" /> </said>
             <said who="Father Arnall">&#8213;I will ask you therefore, my dear boys, to put away from <lb n="289" />
            your minds during these few days all worldly thoughts, <lb n="290" />
            whether of study or pleasure or ambition, and to give all your <lb n="291" />
            attention to the state of your souls. I need hardly remind you <lb n="292" />
            that during the days of the retreat all boys are expected to <lb n="293" />
            preserve a quiet and pious demeanour and to shun all loud <lb n="294" />
            unseemly pleasure. The elder boys, of course, will see that this <lb n="295" />
            custom is not infringed and I look especially to the prefects and <lb n="296" />
            officers of the sodality of Our Blessed Lady and of the sodality <lb n="297" />
            of the holy angels to set a good example to their fellowstu- <lb n="298" />
            dents.<lb n="299" /></said> </p>
            <p><said who="Father Arnall">&#8213;Let us try therefore to make this retreat in honour of saint <lb n="300" />
            Francis with our whole heart and our whole mind. God's bless- <lb n="301" />
            ing will then be upon all your year's studies. But, above and <lb n="302" />
            beyond all, let this retreat be one to which you can look back in <lb n="303" />
            after years when maybe you are far from this college and <lb n="304" />
            among very different surroundings, to which you can look back <lb n="305" />
            with joy and thankfulness and give thanks to God for having <lb n="306" />
            granted you this occasion of laying the first foundation of a <lb n="307" />
            pious honourable zealous christian life. And if, as may so <lb n="308" />
            happen, there be at this moment in these benches any poor soul <lb n="309" />
            which has had the unutterable misfortune to lose God's holy <lb n="310" />
            grace and to fall into grievous sin I fervently trust and pray that <lb n="311" />
            this retreat may be the turningpoint in the life of that soul. I <lb n="312" />
            pray to God  through the merits of His zealous servant Francis <lb n="313" />
            Xavier that such a soul may be led to sincere repentance and <lb n="314" />
            that the holy communion on saint Francis' day of this year may <lb n="315" />
            be a lasting covenant between God and that soul. For just and <lb n="316" />
            unjust, for saint and sinner alike, may this retreat be a mem- <lb n="317" />
            orable one.<lb n="318" /> </said>
             <said who="Father Arnall">&#8213;Help me, my dear little brothers in Christ. Help me by your <lb n="319" />
            pious attention, by your own devotion, by your outward de- <lb n="320" />
            meanour. Banish from your minds all worldly thoughts and <lb n="321" />
            think only of the last things, death, judgment, hell and heaven. <lb n="322" />
            He who remembers these things, says Ecclesiastes, shall not sin <lb n="323" />
            for ever. He who remembers the last things will act and think <lb n="324" />
            with them always before his eyes. He will live a good life and <lb n="325" />
            die a good death, believing and knowing that, if he has sacri- <lb n="326" />
            ficed much in this earthly life, it will be given to him a <lb n="327" />
            hundredfold and a thousandfold more in the life to come, in the <lb n="328" />
            kingdom without end &#8211; a blessing, my dear boys, which I wish <lb n="329" />
            you from my heart; one and all, in the name of the Father and <lb n="330" />
            of the Son and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.<lb n="331" /></said> </p>
            <p> As he walked home with silent companions a thick fog <lb n="332" />
            seemed to compass his mind. He waited in stupor of mind till it <lb n="333" />
            should lift and reveal what it had hidden. He ate his dinner <lb n="334" />
            with surly appetite and, when the meal was over and the <lb n="335" />
            greasestrewn plates lay abandoned on the table, he rose and <lb n="336" />
            went to the window, clearing the thick scum from his mouth <lb n="337" />
            with his tongue and licking it from his lips. So he had sunk to <lb n="338" />
            the state of a beast that licks his chaps after meat. This was the <lb n="339" />
            end: and a faint glimmer of fear began to pierce the fog of his <lb n="340" />
            mind. He pressed his face against the pane of the window and <lb n="341" />
            gazed out into the darkening street. Forms passed this way and <lb n="342" />
            that way through the dull light. And that was life. The letters <lb n="343" />
            of the name of Dublin lay heavily upon his mind, pushing one <lb n="344" />
            another surlily hither and thither with slow boorish insistence. <lb n="345" />
            His soul was fattening and congealing into a gross grease, <lb n="346" />
            plunging ever deeper in its dull fear into a sombre threatening <lb n="347" />
            dusk, while the body that was his stood, listless and dishon- <lb n="348" />
            oured, gazing out of darkened eyes, helpless, perturbed and <lb n="349" />
            human for a bovine god to stare upon.<lb n="350" /> </p>
            <p> The next day brought death and judgment, stirring his soul <lb n="351" />
            slowly from its listless despair. The faint glimmer of fear be- <lb n="352" />
            came a terror of spirit as the hoarse voice of the preacher blew <lb n="353" />
            death into his soul. He suffered its agony. He felt the deathchill <lb n="354" />
            touch the extremities and creep onward towards the heart, the <lb n="355" />
            film of death veiling the eyes, the bright centres of the brain <lb n="356" />
            extinguished one by one like lamps, the last sweat oozing upon <lb n="357" />
            the skin, the powerlessness of the dying limbs, the speech <lb n="358" />
            thickening and wandering and failing, the heart throbbing <lb n="359" />
            faintly and more faintly, all but vanquished, the breath, the <lb n="360" />
            poor timid breath, the poor helpless human spirit, sobbing and <lb n="361" />
            sighing, gurgling  and rattling in the throat. No help! No help! <lb n="362" />
            He, he himself, his body to which he had yielded was dying. <lb n="363" />
            Into the grave with it! Nail it down into a wooden box, the <lb n="364" />
            corpse. Carry it out of the house on the shoulders of hirelings. <lb n="365" />
            Thrust it out of men's sight into a long hole in the ground, into <lb n="366" />
            the grave, to rot, to feed the mass of its creeping worms and to <lb n="367" />
            be devoured by scuttling plumpbellied rats.<lb n="368" /> </p>
            <p> And while the friends were still standing in tears by the <lb n="369" />
            bedside the soul of the sinner was judged. At the last moment <lb n="370" />
            of consciousness the whole earthly life passed before the vision <lb n="371" />
            of the soul and, ere it had time to reflect, the body had died and <lb n="372" />
            the soul stood terrified before the judgmentseat. God, who had <lb n="373" />
            long been merciful, would then be just. He had long been <lb n="374" />
            patient, pleading with the sinful soul, giving it time to repent, <lb n="375" />
            sparing it yet awhile. But that time had gone. Time was to sin <lb n="376" />
            and to enjoy, time was to scoff at God and at  the warnings of <lb n="377" />
            His holy church, time was to defy His majesty, to disobey His <lb n="378" />
            commands, to hoodwink one's fellow men, to commit sin after <lb n="379" />
            sin and sin after sin and to hide one's corruption from the sight <lb n="380" />
            of men. But that time was over. Now it was God's turn: and He <lb n="381" />
            was not to be hoodwinked or deceived. Every sin would then <lb n="382" />
            come forth from its lurkingplace, the most rebellious against <lb n="383" />
            the divine will and the most degrading to our poor corrupt <lb n="384" />
            nature, the tiniest imperfection and the most heinous atrocity. <lb n="385" />
            What did it avail then to have been a great emperor, a great <lb n="386" />
            general, a marvellous inventor, the most learned of the learned? <lb n="387" />
            All were as one before the judgmentseat of God. He would <lb n="388" />
            reward the good and punish the wicked. One single instant was <lb n="389" />
            enough for the trial of a man's soul. One single instant after the <lb n="390" />
            body's death, the soul had been weighed in the balance. The <lb n="391" />
            particular judgment was over and the soul had passed to the <lb n="392" />
            abode of bliss or to the prison of purgatory or had been hurled <lb n="393" />
            howling into hell.<lb n="394" /> </p>
            <p> Nor was that all. God's justice had still to be vindicated <lb n="395" />
            before men: after the particular there still remained the general <lb n="396" />
            judgment. The last day had come. The doomsday was at hand. <lb n="397" />
            The stars of heaven were falling upon the earth like the figs <lb n="398" />
            cast by the figtree which the wind has shaken. The sun, the <lb n="399" />
            great luminary of the universe, had become as sackcloth of <lb n="400" />
            hair. The moon was bloodred. The firmament was as a scroll <lb n="401" />
            rolled away. The archangel Michael, the prince of the heavenly <lb n="402" />
            host, appeared glorious and terrible against the sky. With one <lb n="403" />
            foot on the sea and one foot on the land he blew from the <lb n="404" />
            archangelical trumpet the brazen death of time. The three <lb n="405" />
            blasts of the angel filled all the universe. Time is, time was but <lb n="406" />
            time shall be no more. At the last blast the souls of universal <lb n="407" />
            humanity throng towards the valley of Jehoshaphat, rich and <lb n="408" />
            poor, gentle and simple, wise and foolish, good and wicked. <lb n="409" />
            The soul of every human being that has ever existed, the souls <lb n="410" />
            of all those who shall yet be born, all the sons and daughters of <lb n="411" />
            Adam, all are assembled on that supreme day. And lo the <lb n="412" />
            supreme judge is coming! No longer the lowly Lamb of God, <lb n="413" />
            no longer the meek Jesus of Nazareth, no longer the Man of <lb n="414" />
            Sorrows, no longer the Good Shepherd,  He is seen now coming <lb n="415" />
            upon the clouds, in great power and majesty, attended by nine <lb n="416" />
            choirs of angels, angels and archangels, principalities, powers <lb n="417" />
            and virtues, thrones and dominations, cherubim and seraphim, <lb n="418" />
            God Omnipotent, God Everlasting. He speaks: and His voice is <lb n="419" />
            heard even at the farthest limits of space, even in the bottom- <lb n="420" />
            less abyss. Supreme Judge, from His sentence there will be and <lb n="421" />
            can be no appeal. He calls the just to His side bidding them <lb n="422" />
            enter into the kingdom, the eternity of bliss prepared for them. <lb n="423" />
            The unjust He casts from Him, crying in His offended majesty: <lb n="424" />
            <emph>Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire which was</emph> <lb n="425" />
            <emph>prepared for the devil and his angels.</emph> O what agony then for <lb n="426" />
            the miserable sinners! Friend is torn apart from friend, children are torn <lb n="427" />
            from their parents, husbands from their wives. The poor sinner <lb n="428" />
            holds out his arms to those who were dear and near to him in <lb n="429" />
            this earthly world, to those whose simple piety perhaps he <lb n="430" />
            made a mock of, to those who counselled him and tried to lead <lb n="431" />
            him on the right path, to a kind brother, to a loving sister, to <lb n="432" />
            the mother and father who loved him so dearly. But it is too <lb n="433" />
            late: the just turn away from the wretched damned souls which <lb n="434" />
            now appear before the eyes of all in their hideous and evil <lb n="435" />
            character. O you hypocrites, O you whited sepulchres, O you <lb n="436" />
            who present a smooth smiling face to the world while your soul <lb n="437" />
            within is a foul swamp of sin, how will it fare with you in that <lb n="438" />
            terrible day?<lb n="439" /> </p>
            <p> And this day will come, shall come, must come: the day of <lb n="440" />
            death and the day of judgment. It is appointed unto man to die <lb n="441" />
            and after death the judgment. Death is certain. The time and <lb n="442" />
            manner are uncertain,  whether from long disease or from some <lb n="443" />
            unexpected accident: the Son of God cometh at an hour when <lb n="444" />
            you little expect Him. Be therefore ready every moment, seeing <lb n="445" />
            that you may die at any moment. Death is the end of us all. <lb n="446" />
            Death and judgment, brought into the world by the sin of our <lb n="447" />
            first parents, are the dark portals that close our earthly exist- <lb n="448" />
            ence, the portals that open into the unknown and the unseen, <lb n="449" />
            portals through which every soul must pass, alone, unaided <lb n="450" />
            save by its good works, without friend or  brother or parents or <lb n="451" />
            master to help it, alone and trembling. Let that thought be ever <lb n="452" />
            before our minds and then we cannot sin. Death, a cause of <lb n="453" />
            terror to the sinner, is a blessed moment for him who has <lb n="454" />
            walked in the right path, fulfilling the duties of his station in <lb n="455" />
            life, attending to his morning and evening prayers, approaching <lb n="456" />
            the holy sacrament frequently and performing good and mer- <lb n="457" />
            ciful works. For the pious and believing catholic, for the just <lb n="458" />
            man, death is no cause of terror. Was it not Addison, the great <lb n="459" />
            English writer, who, when on his deathbed, sent for the wicked <lb n="460" />
            young earl of Warwick to let him see how a christian can meet <lb n="461" />
            his end? He it is and he alone, the pious and believing christian, <lb n="462" />
            who can say in his heart:<lb n="463" /> </p>
            <lg>
              O grave, where is thy victory? <lb n="464" />
              O death, where is thy sting? <lb n="465" />
            </lg>
            <p> Every word of it was for him. Against his sin, foul and <lb n="466" />
            secret, the whole wrath of God was aimed. The preacher's <lb n="467" />
            knife had probed deeply into his diseased conscience and he felt <lb n="468" />
            now that his soul was festering in sin. Yes, the preacher was <lb n="469" />
            right. God's turn had come. Like a beast in its lair his soul had <lb n="470" />
            lain down in its own filth but the blasts of the angel's trumpet <lb n="471" />
            had driven him forth from the darkness of sin into the light. <lb n="472" />
            The words of doom cried by the angel shattered in an instant <lb n="473" />
            his presumptuous peace. The wind of the last day blew through <lb n="474" />
            his mind; his sins, the jeweleyed harlots of his imagination, fled <lb n="475" />
            before the hurricane, squeaking like mice in their terror and <lb n="476" />
            huddled under a mane of hair.<lb n="477" /> </p>
            <p> As he crossed the square, walking homeward, the light <lb n="478" />
            laughter of a girl reached his burning ears. The frail gay sound <lb n="479" />
            smote his heart more strongly than a trumpetblast, and, not <lb n="480" />
            daring to lift his eyes, he turned aside and gazed, as he walked, <lb n="481" />
            into the shadow of the tangled shrubs. Shame rose from his <lb n="482" />
            smitten heart and flooded his whole being. The image of Emma <lb n="483" />
            appeared before him and, under her eyes, the flood of shame <lb n="484" />
            rushed forth anew from his heart. If she knew to what his mind <lb n="485" />
            had subjected her or how his brutelike lust had torn and <lb n="486" />
            trampled upon her innocence! Was that boyish love? Was that <lb n="487" />
            chivalry? Was that poetry? The sordid details of his orgies stank <lb n="488" />
            under his very nostrils: the sootcoated packet of pictures which <lb n="489" />
            he had hidden in the flue of the fireplace and in the presence of <lb n="490" />
            whose shameless or bashful  wantonness he lay for hours sin- <lb n="491" />
            ning in thought and deed: his monstrous dreams, peopled by <lb n="492" />
            apelike creatures and by harlots with gleaming jewel eyes: the <lb n="493" />
            foul long letters he had written in the joy of guilty confession <lb n="494" />
            and carried secretly for days and days only to throw them <lb n="495" />
            under cover of night among the grass in the corner of a field or <lb n="496" />
            beneath some hingeless door or in some niche in the hedges <lb n="497" />
            where a girl might come upon them as she walked by and read <lb n="498" />
            them secretly. Mad! Mad! Was it possible he had done these <lb n="499" />
            things? A cold sweat broke out upon his forehead as the foul <lb n="500" />
            memories condensed within his brain.<lb n="501" /> </p>
            <p> When the agony of shame had passed from him he tried to <lb n="502" />
            raise his soul from its abject powerlessness. God and the <lb n="503" />
            Blessed Virgin were too far from him: God was too great and <lb n="504" />
            stern and the Blessed Virgin too pure and holy. But he imagined <lb n="505" />
            that he stood near Emma in a wide land and,  humbly  and in <lb n="506" />
            tears, bent and kissed the elbow of her sleeve.<lb n="507" /> </p>
            <p> In a wide land under a tender lucid evening sky, a cloud <lb n="508" />
            drifting westward amid a pale green sea of heaven, they stood <lb n="509" />
            together, children that had  erred. Their error had offended <lb n="510" />
            deeply God's majesty, though it was the error of two children, <lb n="511" />
            but it had not offended her whose beauty <emph>is not like earthly</emph> <lb n="512" />
            <emph>beauty, dangerous to look upon, but like the morning star</emph> <lb n="513" />
            <emph>which is its emblem, bright and musical</emph>. The eyes were not <lb n="514" />
            offended which she turned upon them nor reproachful. She <lb n="515" />
            placed their hands together, hand in hand, and said, speaking <lb n="516" />
            to their hearts: <lb n="517" />
             <said who="Virgin Mary">&#8213;Take hands, Stephen and Emma. It is a beautiful evening <lb n="518" />
            now in heaven. You have erred but you are always my children. <lb n="519" />
            It is one heart that loves another heart. Take hands together, <lb n="520" />
            my dear children, and you  will  be happy together and your <lb n="521" />
            hearts will love each other.<lb n="522" /></said> </p>
            <p> The chapel was flooded by the dull scarlet light that filtered <lb n="523" />
            through the lowered blinds: and through the fissure between <lb n="524" />
            the last blind and the sash a shaft of wan light entered like a <lb n="525" />
            spear and touched the embossed brasses of the candlesticks <lb n="526" />
            upon the altar that gleamed like the battleworn mail armour of <lb n="527" />
            angels.<lb n="528" /> </p>
            <p> Rain was falling on the chapel, on the garden, on the college. <lb n="529" />
            It would rain for ever, noiselessly. The water would rise inch <lb n="530" />
            by inch, covering the grass and shrubs, covering the trees and <lb n="531" />
            houses, covering the monuments and the mountain tops. All <lb n="532" />
            life would be choked off, noiselessly: birds, men, elephants, <lb n="533" />
            pigs, children: noiselessly floating corpses amid the litter of the <lb n="534" />
            wreckage of the world. Forty days and forty nights the rain <lb n="535" />
            would fall till the waters covered the face of the earth.<lb n="536" /> </p>
            <p> It might be. Why not? <lb n="537" />
             <said who="Father Arnall">&#8213;<emph>Hell has enlarged its soul and opened its mouth without any</emph> <lb n="538" />
            <emph>limits</emph> &#8211; words taken, my dear little brothers in Christ Jesus, <lb n="539" />
            from the book of Isaias, fifth chapter, fourteenth verse. In the <lb n="540" />
            name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost. <lb n="541" />
            Amen.<lb n="542" /></said> </p>
            <p> The preacher took a chainless watch from a pocket within <lb n="543" />
            his soutane and, having considered its dial for a moment in <lb n="544" />
            silence, placed it silently before him on the table.<lb n="545" /> </p>
            <p> He began  to speak in a quiet tone. <lb n="546" />
             <said who="Father Arnall">&#8213;Adam and Eve, my dear boys, were, as you know, our first <lb n="547" />
            parents and you will remember that they were created by God <lb n="548" />
            in order that the seats in heaven left vacant by the fall of <lb n="549" />
            Lucifer and his rebellious angels might be filled again. Lucifer, <lb n="550" />
            we are  told, was a son of the morning, a radiant and mighty <lb n="551" />
            angel; yet he fell: he fell and there fell with him a third part of <lb n="552" />
            the host of heaven: he fell and was hurled with his rebellious <lb n="553" />
            angels into hell. What his sin was we cannot say. Theologians <lb n="554" />
            consider that it was the sin of pride, the sinful thought con- <lb n="555" />
            ceived in an instant: <emph><seg xml:lang="la">non serviam</seg>: I will not serve</emph>. That instant <lb n="556" />
            was his ruin. He offended the majesty of God by the sinful <lb n="557" />
            thought of one instant and God cast him out of heaven into hell <lb n="558" />
            for ever.<lb n="559" /> </said>
             <said who="Father Arnall">&#8213;Adam and Eve were then created by God and placed in <lb n="560" />
            Eden, that lovely garden in the plain of Damascus that lovely garden resplendent <lb n="561" />
            with sunlight and colour, teeming with luxuriant vegetation. <lb n="562" />
            The fruitful earth gave them her bounty: beasts and birds were <lb n="563" />
            their willing servants: they knew not the ills our flesh is heir to, <lb n="564" />
            disease and poverty and death: all that a great and generous <lb n="565" />
            God could do for them was done. But there was one condition <lb n="566" />
            imposed on them by God: obedience to His word. They were <lb n="567" />
            not to eat of the fruit of the forbidden tree.<lb n="568" /> </said>
             <said who="Father Arnall">&#8213;Alas, my dear little boys, they too fell. The devil, once a <lb n="569" />
            shining angel, a son of the morning, now a foul fiend came to <lb n="570" />
            them in the shape of a serpent, the subtlest of all the beasts of <lb n="571" />
            the field. He envied them. He, the fallen great one, could not <lb n="572" />
            bear to think that man, a being of clay, should possess the <lb n="573" />
            inheritance which he by his sin had forfeited for ever. He came <lb n="574" />
            to the woman, the weaker vessel, and poured the poison of his <lb n="575" />
            eloquence into her ear, promising her  (O, the blasphemy of that <lb n="576" />
            promise!) that if she and Adam ate of the forbidden fruit they <lb n="577" />
            would become as gods, nay as God Himself. Eve yielded to the <lb n="578" />
            wiles of the archtempter. She ate the apple and gave it also to <lb n="579" />
            Adam who had not the moral courage to resist her. The poison <lb n="580" />
            tongue of Satan had done its work. They fell.<lb n="581" /> </said>
             <said who="Father Arnall">&#8213;And then the voice of God was heard in that garden, calling <lb n="582" />
            His creature man to account: and Michael, prince of the heav- <lb n="583" />
            enly host, with a sword of flame in his hand appeared before <lb n="584" />
            the guilty pair and drove them forth from Eden into the world, <lb n="585" />
            the world of sickness and striving, of cruelty and disappoint- <lb n="586" />
            ment, of labour and hardship, to earn their bread in the sweat <lb n="587" />
            of their brow. But even then how merciful was God! He took <lb n="588" />
            pity on our poor degraded first parents and promised that in <lb n="589" />
            the fulness of time He would send down from heaven One who <lb n="590" />
            would redeem them, make them once more children of God <lb n="591" />
            and heirs to the kingdom of heaven: and that One, that <lb n="592" />
            Redeemer of fallen man, was to be God's onlybegotten  Son, the <lb n="593" />
            Second Person of the Most Blessed Trinity, the Eternal Word.<lb n="594" /> </said>
             <said who="Father Arnall">&#8213;He came. He was born of a virgin pure, Mary the virgin <lb n="595" />
            mother. He was born in a poor cowhouse in Judea and lived as <lb n="596" />
            a humble carpenter for thirty years until the hour of His <lb n="597" />
            mission had come. And then, filled with love for men, He went <lb n="598" />
            forth and called to men to hear the new gospel.<lb n="599" /> </said>
             <said who="Father Arnall">&#8213;Did they listen? Yes, they listened but would not hear. He <lb n="600" />
            was seized and bound like a common criminal, mocked at as a <lb n="601" />
            fool, set aside to give place to a public robber, scourged with <lb n="602" />
            five thousand lashes, crowned with a crown of thorns, hustled <lb n="603" />
            through the streets by the jewish rabble and the Roman sol- <lb n="604" />
            diery, stripped of His garments and hanged upon a gibbet and <lb n="605" />
            His side was pierced with a lance and from the wounded body <lb n="606" />
            of Our Lord water and blood issued continually.<lb n="607" /> </said>
             <said who="Father Arnall">&#8213;Yet even then, in that hour of supreme agony, Our Merciful <lb n="608" />
            Redeemer had pity for mankind. Yet even there, on the hill of <lb n="609" />
            Calvary, He founded the holy catholic church against which, it <lb n="610" />
            is promised, the gates of hell shall not prevail. He founded it <lb n="611" />
            upon the rock of ages and endowed it with His grace, with <lb n="612" />
            sacraments and sacrifice, and promised that if men would obey <lb n="613" />
            the word of His church they would still enter into eternal life <lb n="614" />
            but if, after all that had been done for them, they still persisted <lb n="615" />
            in their wickedness there  remained for them an eternity of <lb n="616" />
            torment: hell.<lb n="617" /></said> </p>
            <p> The preacher's voice sank. He paused, joined his palms for <lb n="618" />
            an instant, parted them. Then he resumed: <lb n="619" />
             <said who="Father Arnall">&#8213;Now let us try for a moment to realise, as far as we can, the <lb n="620" />
            nature of that abode of the damned which the justice of an <lb n="621" />
            offended God has called into existence for the eternal punish- <lb n="622" />
            ment of sinners. Hell is a strait and dark and foulsmelling <lb n="623" />
            prison, an abode of demons and lost souls, filled with fire and <lb n="624" />
            smoke. The straitness of this prison house is expressly designed <lb n="625" />
            by God to punish those who refused to be bound by His laws. <lb n="626" />
            In earthly prisons the poor captive has at least some liberty of <lb n="627" />
            movement, were it only within the four walls of his cell or in <lb n="628" />
            the gloomy yard of his prison. Not so in hell. There, by reason <lb n="629" />
            of the great number of the damned, the prisoners are heaped <lb n="630" />
            together in their awful prison the walls of which are said to be <lb n="631" />
            four thousand miles thick: and the damned are so utterly <lb n="632" />
            bound and helpless that, as a blessed saint, saint Anselm, writes <lb n="633" />
            in his book on similitudes, they are not even able to remove <lb n="634" />
            from the eye a worm that gnaws it.<lb n="635" /> </said>
             <said who="Father Arnall">&#8213;They lie in exterior darkness. For, remember, the fire of hell <lb n="636" />
            gives forth no light. As, at the command of God, the fire of the <lb n="637" />
            Babylonian furnace lost its heat but not its light so, at the <lb n="638" />
            command of God, the fire of hell, while retaining the intensity <lb n="639" />
            of its heat, burns eternally in darkness. It is a neverending <lb n="640" />
            storm of darkness, dark flames and dark smoke of burning <lb n="641" />
            brimstone, amid which the bodies are heaped one upon another <lb n="642" />
            without even a glimpse of air. Of all the plagues with which the <lb n="643" />
            land of the Pharaohs was smitten one plague alone, that of <lb n="644" />
            darkness, was called horrible. What name, then, shall we give <lb n="645" />
            to the darkness of hell which is to last not for three days alone <lb n="646" />
            but for all eternity?<lb n="647" /> </said>
             <said who="Father Arnall">&#8213;The horror of this strait and dark prison is increased by its <lb n="648" />
            awful stench. All the filth of the world, all the offal and scum <lb n="649" />
            of the world, we are told, shall run there as to a vast reeking <lb n="650" />
            sewer when the terrible conflagration of the last day has purged <lb n="651" />
            the world. The brimstone too which burns there in such pro- <lb n="652" />
            digious quantity fills all hell with its intolerable stench: and the <lb n="653" />
            bodies of the damned themselves exhale such a pestilential <lb n="654" />
            odour that, as saint Bonaventure says, one of them alone would <lb n="655" />
            suffice to infect the whole world. The very air of this world, <lb n="656" />
            that pure element, becomes foul and unbreathable when it has <lb n="657" />
            been long enclosed. Consider then what must be the foulness of <lb n="658" />
            the air of hell. Imagine some foul and putrid corpse that has <lb n="659" />
            lain rotting and decomposing in the grave, a jellylike mass of <lb n="660" />
            liquid corruption. Imagine such a corpse a prey to  flames, <lb n="661" />
            devoured by the fire of burning brimstone and giving off dense <lb n="662" />
            choking fumes of nauseous loathsome decomposition. And <lb n="663" />
            then imagine this sickening stench, multiplied a millionfold and <lb n="664" />
            a millionfold again from the millions upon millions of fetid <lb n="665" />
            carcases massed together in the reeking darkness,  a huge and <lb n="666" />
            rotting human fungus. Imagine all this and you will have some <lb n="667" />
            idea of the horror of the stench of hell.<lb n="668" /> </said>
             <said who="Father Arnall">&#8213;But this stench is not, horrible though it is, the greatest <lb n="669" />
            physical torment to which the damned are subjected. The <lb n="670" />
            torment of fire is the greatest torment to which the tyrant has <lb n="671" />
            ever subjected his fellowcreatures. Place your finger for a mo- <lb n="672" />
            ment in the flame of a candle and you will feel the pain of fire. <lb n="673" />
            But our earthly fire was created by God for the benefit of man, <lb n="674" />
            to maintain in him the spark of life and to help him in the <lb n="675" />
            useful arts whereas the fire of hell is of another quality and was <lb n="676" />
            created by God to torture and punish the unrepentant sinner. <lb n="677" />
            Our earthly fire also consumes more or less rapidly according <lb n="678" />
            as the object which it attacks is more or less combustible so <lb n="679" />
            that human ingenuity has even succeeded in inventing chemical <lb n="680" />
            preparations to check or frustrate its action. But the sulphu- <lb n="681" />
            reous brimstone which burns in hell is a substance which is <lb n="682" />
            specially designed to burn for ever and for ever with unspeak- <lb n="683" />
            able fury. Moreover our earthly fire destroys at the same time <lb n="684" />
            as it burns so that the more intense it is the shorter is its dur- <lb n="685" />
            ation: but the fire of hell has this property that it preserves that <lb n="686" />
            which it burns and though it rages with incredible intensity it <lb n="687" />
            rages for ever.<lb n="688" /> </said>
             <said who="Father Arnall">&#8213;Our earthly fire again, no matter how fierce or widespread it <lb n="689" />
            may be, is always of a limited extent: but the lake of fire in hell <lb n="690" />
            is boundless, shoreless and bottomless. It is on record that the <lb n="691" />
            devil himself, when asked the question by a certain soldier, was <lb n="692" />
            obliged to confess that if a whole mountain were thrown into <lb n="693" />
            the burning ocean of hell it would be burned up in an instant <lb n="694" />
            like a piece of wax. And this terrible fire will not afflict the <lb n="695" />
            bodies of the damned only from without but each lost soul will <lb n="696" />
            be a hell unto itself, the boundless fire raging in its very vitals. <lb n="697" />
            O, how terrible is the lot of those wretched beings! The blood <lb n="698" />
            seethes and boils in the veins, the brains are boiling in the skull, <lb n="699" />
            the heart in the breast glowing and bursting, the bowels a <lb n="700" />
            redhot mass of burning pulp, the tender eyes flaming like mol- <lb n="701" />
            ten balls.<lb n="702" /> </said>
             <said who="Father Arnall">&#8213;And yet what I have said as to the strength and quality and <lb n="703" />
            boundlessness of this fire is as nothing when compared to its <lb n="704" />
            intensity, an intensity which it has as being the instrument <lb n="705" />
            chosen by divine design for the punishment of soul and body <lb n="706" />
            alike. It is a fire which proceeds directly from the ire of God, <lb n="707" />
            working not of its own activity but as an instrument of divine <lb n="708" />
            vengeance. As the waters of baptism cleanse the soul with the <lb n="709" />
            body so do the fires of punishment torture the spirit with the <lb n="710" />
            flesh. Every sense of the flesh is tortured and every faculty of <lb n="711" />
            the soul therewith: the eyes with impenetrable utter darkness, <lb n="712" />
            the nose with noisome odours, the ears with yells and howls <lb n="713" />
            and execrations, the taste with foul matter, leprous corruption, <lb n="714" />
            nameless suffocating filth, the touch with redhot goads and <lb n="715" />
            spikes, with cruel tongues of flame. And through the several <lb n="716" />
            torments of the senses the immortal soul is tortured eternally in <lb n="717" />
            its very essence amid the leagues upon leagues of glowing fires <lb n="718" />
            kindled in the abyss by the offended majesty of the Omnipotent <lb n="719" />
            God and fanned into everlasting and ever increasing fury by the <lb n="720" />
            breath of the anger of the Godhead.<lb n="721" /> </said>
             <said who="Father Arnall">&#8213;Consider finally that the torment of this infernal prison is <lb n="722" />
            increased by the company of the damned themselves. Evil com- <lb n="723" />
            pany on earth is so noxious that even the plants, as if by <lb n="724" />
            instinct, withdraw from the company of whatsoever is deadly <lb n="725" />
            or hurtful to them. In hell all laws are overturned: there is no <lb n="726" />
            thought of family or country, of ties or relationship. The <lb n="727" />
            damned howl and scream at one another, their torture and rage <lb n="728" />
            intensified by the presence of beings tortured and raging like <lb n="729" />
            themselves. All sense of humanity is forgotten. The yells of the <lb n="730" />
            suffering sinners fill the remotest corners of the vast abyss. The <lb n="731" />
            mouths of the damned are full of blasphemies against God and <lb n="732" />
            of hatred for their fellow sufferers and of curses against those <lb n="733" />
            souls which were their  accomplices in sin. In olden times it was <lb n="734" />
            the custom to punish the parricide, the man who had raised his <lb n="735" />
            murderous hand against his father, by casting him into the <lb n="736" />
            depths of the sea in a sack in which were placed a cock, a <lb n="737" />
            monkey and a serpent. The intention of those lawgivers who <lb n="738" />
            framed such a law, which seems cruel in our times, was to <lb n="739" />
            punish the criminal by the company of hateful and hurtful <lb n="740" />
            beasts. But what is the fury of those dumb beasts compared <lb n="741" />
            with the fury of execration which bursts from the parched lips <lb n="742" />
            and aching throats of the damned in hell when they behold in <lb n="743" />
            their companions in misery those who aided and abetted them <lb n="744" />
            in sin, those whose words sowed the first seeds of evil thinking <lb n="745" />
            and evil living in their minds, those whose immodest sugges- <lb n="746" />
            tions led them on to sin, those whose eyes tempted and allured <lb n="747" />
            them from the path of virtue. They turn upon those accom- <lb n="748" />
            plices and upbraid them and curse them. But they are helpless <lb n="749" />
            and hopeless: it is too late now for repentance.<lb n="750" /> </said>
             <said who="Father Arnall">&#8213;Last of all consider the frightful torment to those damned <lb n="751" />
            souls, tempters and tempted alike,  of the company of the devils. <lb n="752" />
            These devils will afflict the damned in two ways, by their pres- <lb n="753" />
            ence and by their reproaches. We can have no idea of how <lb n="754" />
            horrible these devils are. Saint Catherine of Siena once saw a <lb n="755" />
            devil and she has written that, rather than look again for one <lb n="756" />
            single instant on such a frightful monster, she would prefer to <lb n="757" />
            walk until the end of her life along a track of red coals. These <lb n="758" />
            devils, who were once beautiful angels, have become as hideous <lb n="759" />
            and ugly as they once were beautiful. They mock and  jeer at <lb n="760" />
            the lost souls whom they dragged down to ruin. It is they, the <lb n="761" />
            foul demons, who are made in hell the voices of conscience. <lb n="762" />
            Why did you sin? Why did you lend an ear to the temptings of <lb n="763" />
            fiends? Why did you turn aside from your pious practices and <lb n="764" />
            good works? Why did you not shun the occasions of sin? Why <lb n="765" />
            did you not leave that evil companion? Why did you not give <lb n="766" />
            up that lewd habit, that impure habit? Why did you not listen <lb n="767" />
            to the counsels of your confessor? Why did you not, even after <lb n="768" />
            you had fallen the first or the second or the third or the fourth <lb n="769" />
            or the hundredth time, repent of your evil ways and turn to <lb n="770" />
            God who only waited for your repentance to absolve you of <lb n="771" />
            your sins? Now the time for repentance has gone by. Time is, <lb n="772" />
            time was but time shall be no more! Time was to sin in secrecy, <lb n="773" />
            to indulge in that sloth and pride, to covet the unlawful, to <lb n="774" />
            yield to the promptings of your lower nature, to live like the <lb n="775" />
            beasts of the field, nay worse than the beasts of the field for <lb n="776" />
            they, at least, are but brutes and have not reason to guide them: <lb n="777" />
            time was but time shall be no more. God spoke to you by so <lb n="778" />
            many voices but you would not hear. You would not crush out <lb n="779" />
            that pride and anger in your heart, you would not restore those <lb n="780" />
            illgotten goods, you would not obey the precepts of your holy <lb n="781" />
            church nor attend to your religious duties, you would not <lb n="782" />
            abandon those wicked companions, you would not avoid those <lb n="783" />
            dangerous temptations. Such is the language of those fiendish <lb n="784" />
            tormentors, words of taunting and of reproach, of hatred and <lb n="785" />
            of disgust. Of disgust, yes! For even they, the very devils, when <lb n="786" />
            they sinned sinned by such a sin as alone was compatible with <lb n="787" />
            such angelical natures, a rebellion of the intellect: and they, <lb n="788" />
            even they, the foul devils must turn away, revolted and dis- <lb n="789" />
            gusted, from the contemplation of those unspeakable sins by <lb n="790" />
            which degraded man outrages and defiles the temple of the <lb n="791" />
            Holy Ghost, defiles and pollutes himself.<lb n="792" /> </said>
             <said who="Father Arnall">&#8213;O, my dear little brothers in Christ, may it never be our lot <lb n="793" />
            to hear that language! May it never be our lot, I say! In the last <lb n="794" />
            day of terrible reckoning I pray fervently to God that not a <lb n="795" />
            single soul of those who are in this chapel today may be found <lb n="796" />
            among those miserable beings whom the Great Judge shall <lb n="797" />
            command to depart for ever from His sight, that not one of us <lb n="798" />
            may ever hear ringing in his ears the awful sentence of rejec- <lb n="799" />
            tion: <emph>Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire which</emph> <lb n="800" />
            <emph>was prepared for the devil and his angels!</emph><lb n="801" /></said> </p>
            <p> He came down the aisle of the chapel, his legs shaking and <lb n="802" />
            the scalp of his head trembling as though it had been touched <lb n="803" />
            by ghostly fingers. He passed up the staircase and into the <lb n="804" />
            corridor along the walls of which the overcoats and water- <lb n="805" />
            proofs hung like gibbeted malefactors, headless and dripping <lb n="806" />
            and shapeless. And at every step he feared that he had already <lb n="807" />
            died, that his soul had been wrenched forth of the sheath of his <lb n="808" />
            body, that he was plunging headlong through space.<lb n="809" /> </p>
            <p> He could not grip the floor with his feet and sat heavily at <lb n="810" />
            his desk, opening one of his books at random and poring over <lb n="811" />
            it. Every word for him! It was true. God was almighty. God <lb n="812" />
            could call him now, call him as he sat at his desk, before he had <lb n="813" />
            time to be conscious of the summons. God had called him. Yes? <lb n="814" />
            What? Yes? His flesh shrank together as it felt the approach of <lb n="815" />
            the ravenous tongues of flames, dried up as it felt about it the <lb n="816" />
            swirl of stifling air. He had died. Yes. He was judged. A wave <lb n="817" />
            of fire swept through his body: the first. Again a wave. His <lb n="818" />
            brain began to glow. Another. His brain was simmering and <lb n="819" />
            bubbling within the cracking tenement of the skull. Flames <lb n="820" />
            burst forth from his skull like a corolla, shrieking like voices: <lb n="821" />
             <said who="Flames">&#8213;Hell! Hell! Hell! Hell! Hell!<lb n="822" /></said> </p>
            <p> Voices spoke near him: <lb n="823" />
             <said who="a voice">&#8213;On hell.<lb n="824" /> </said>
             <said who="a voice">&#8213;I suppose he rubbed it into you well.<lb n="825" /> </said>
             <said who="a voice">&#8213;You bet he did. He put us all into a blue funk.<lb n="826" /> </said>
             <said who="a voice">&#8213;That's what you fellows want: and plenty of it to make you <lb n="827" />
            work.<lb n="828" /></said> </p>
            <p> He leaned back weakly in his desk. He had not died. God <lb n="829" />
            had spared him still. He was still in the familiar world of the <lb n="830" />
            school. Mr Tate and Vincent Heron stood at the window, <lb n="831" />
            talking, jesting, gazing out at the bleak rain, moving their }|lb n="30833"/| heads. <lb n="832" />
            <said who="Mr Tate">&#8213;I wish it would clear up. I had arranged to go for a spin on <lb n="834" />
            the bike with some fellows out by <place><location><geo>53.450924 -6.150138</geo></location><placeName>Malahide</placeName></place>. But the roads <lb n="835" />
            must be kneedeep.<lb n="836" /> </said>
            <said who="Vincent Heron">&#8213;It might clear up, sir.<lb n="837" /></said> </p>
            <p>The voices that he knew so well, the common words, the <lb n="838" />
            quiet of the classroom when the voices paused and the silence <lb n="839" />
            was filled by the sound of softly browsing cattle as the other <lb n="840" />
            boys munched their lunches tranquilly, lulled his aching soul.<lb n="841" /> </p>
            <p> There was still time. O Mary, refuge of sinners, intercede for <lb n="842" />
            him! O Virgin Undefiled, save him from the gulf of death!<lb n="843" /> </p>
            <p> The English lesson began with the hearing of the history. <lb n="844" />
            Royal persons, favourites, intriguers, bishops passed like mute <lb n="845" />
            phantoms behind their veil of names. All had died: all had been <lb n="846" />
            judged. What did it profit a man to gain the whole world if he <lb n="847" />
            lost his soul? At last he had understood: and human life lay <lb n="848" />
            around him, a plain of peace whereon antlike men laboured in <lb n="849" />
            brotherhood, their dead sleeping under quiet mounds. The el- <lb n="850" />
            bow of his companion touched him and his heart was touched: <lb n="851" />
            and when he spoke to answer a question of his master he heard <lb n="852" />
            his own voice full of the quietude of humility and contrition.<lb n="853" /> </p>
            <p> His soul sank back deeper into depths of contrite peace, no <lb n="854" />
            longer able to suffer the pain of dread and sending forth, as she <lb n="855" />
            sank, a faint prayer. Ah yes, he would still be spared; he would <lb n="856" />
            repent in his heart and be forgiven: and then those above, those <lb n="857" />
            in heaven, would see what he would do to make up for the <lb n="858" />
            past: a whole life, every hour of life. Only wait. <lb n="859" />
             <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;All, God! All, all!<lb n="860" /></said> </p>
            <p> A messenger came to the door to say that confessions were <lb n="861" />
            being heard in the chapel. Four boys left the room; and he <lb n="862" />
            heard others passing down the corridor. A tremulous chill blew <lb n="863" />
            round his heart, no stronger than a little wind, and yet, listen- <lb n="864" />
            ing and suffering silently, he seemed to have laid an ear against <lb n="865" />
            the muscle of his own heart, feeling it close and quail, listening <lb n="866" />
            to the flutter of its ventricles.<lb n="867" /> </p>
            <p> No escape. He had to confess, to speak out in words what he <lb n="868" />
            had done and thought, sin after sin. How? How? <lb n="869" />
             <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;Father, I ...<lb n="870" /></said> </p>
            <p>The thought slid like a cold shining rapier into his tender <lb n="871" />
            flesh: confession. But not there in the chapel of the college. He <lb n="872" />
            would confess all, every sin of deed and thought, sincerely: but <lb n="873" />
            not there among his school companions. Far away from there <lb n="874" />
            in some dark place he would murmur out his own shame: and <lb n="875" />
            he besought God humbly not to be offended with him if he did <lb n="876" />
            not dare to confess in the college chapel: and in utter abjection <lb n="877" />
            of spirit he craved forgiveness mutely of the boyish hearts <lb n="878" />
            about him.<lb n="879" /> </p>
            <p> Time passed.<lb n="880" /> </p>
            <p> He sat again in the front bench of the chapel. The daylight <lb n="881" />
            without was already failing and, as it fell slowly through the <lb n="882" />
            dull red blinds, it seemed that the sun of the last day was going <lb n="883" />
            down and that all souls were being gathered for the judgment. <lb n="884" />
             <said who="Father Arnall">&#8213;<emph>I am cast away from the sight of Thine eyes:</emph> words taken, <lb n="885" />
            my dear little brothers in Christ, from the Book of Psalms, <lb n="886" />
            thirtieth chapter, twentythird verse. In the name of the Father <lb n="887" />
            and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.<lb n="888" /></said> </p>
            <p> The preacher began to speak in a quiet friendly tone. His <lb n="889" />
            face was kind and he joined gently the fingers of each hand, <lb n="890" />
            forming a frail cage by the union of their tips. <lb n="891" />
             <said who="Father Arnall">&#8213;This morning we endeavoured, in our reflection upon hell, <lb n="892" />
            to make what our holy founder calls in his book of spiritual <lb n="893" />
            exercises, the composition of place. We endeavoured, that is, to <lb n="894" />
            imagine with the senses of the mind, in our imagination, the <lb n="895" />
            material character of that awful place and of the physical tor- <lb n="896" />
            ments which all who are in hell endure. This evening we shall <lb n="897" />
            consider for a few moments the nature of the spiritual torments <lb n="898" />
            of hell.<lb n="899" /> </said>
             <said who="Father Arnall">&#8213;Sin, remember, is a twofold enormity. It is a base consent to <lb n="900" />
            the promptings of our corrupt nature, to the lower instincts, to <lb n="901" />
            that which is gross and beastlike; and it is also a turning away <lb n="902" />
            from the counsel of our higher nature, from all that is pure and <lb n="903" />
            holy, from the Holy God Himself. For this reason mortal sin is <lb n="904" />
            punished in hell by two different forms of punishment, physical <lb n="905" />
            and spiritual.<lb n="906" /> </said>
             <said who="Father Arnall">&#8213;Now of all these spiritual pains by far the greatest is the pain <lb n="907" />
            of loss, so great, in fact, that in itself it is a torment greater <lb n="908" />
            than all the others. Saint Thomas, the greatest doctor of the <lb n="909" />
            church, the angelic doctor, as he is called, says that the worst <lb n="910" />
            damnation consists in this that the understanding of man is <lb n="911" />
            totally deprived of divine light and his affection obstinately <lb n="912" />
            turned away from the goodness of God. God, remember, is a <lb n="913" />
            being infinitely good and therefore the loss of such a being <lb n="914" />
            must be a loss infinitely painful. In this life we have not a very <lb n="915" />
            clear idea of what such a loss must be but the damned in hell, <lb n="916" />
            for their greater torment, have a full understanding of that <lb n="917" />
            which they have lost and understand  that they have lost it <lb n="918" />
            through their own sins and have lost it for ever. At the very <lb n="919" />
            instant of death the bonds of the flesh are broken asunder and <lb n="920" />
            the soul at once flies towards God. The soul tends towards <lb n="921" />
            God as towards the centre of her existence. Remember, my <lb n="922" />
            dear little boys, our souls long to be with God. We come from <lb n="923" />
            God, we live by God, we belong to God: we are His, inalien- <lb n="924" />
            ably His. God loves with a divine love every human soul and <lb n="925" />
            every human soul lives in that love. How could it be otherwise? <lb n="926" />
            Every breath that we draw, every thought of our brain, every <lb n="927" />
            instant of life proceed from God's inexhaustible goodness. And <lb n="928" />
            if it be pain for a mother to be parted from her child, for a man <lb n="929" />
            to be exiled from hearth and home, for friend to be sundered <lb n="930" />
            from friend, O think what pain, what anguish it must be for <lb n="931" />
            the poor soul to be spurned from the presence of the supremely <lb n="932" />
            good and loving Creator Who has called that soul into exist- <lb n="933" />
            ence from nothingness and sustained it in life and loved it with <lb n="934" />
            an immeasurable love. This, then, to be separated for ever from <lb n="935" />
            its greatest good, from God, and to feel the anguish of that <lb n="936" />
            separation, knowing full well that it is unchangeable, this is the <lb n="937" />
            greatest torment which the created soul is capable of bearing, <lb n="938" />
            <seg xml:lang="la">poena damni</seg>, the pain of loss.<lb n="939" /> </said>
             <said who="Father Arnall">&#8213;The second pain which will afflict the souls of the damned in <lb n="940" />
            hell is the pain of conscience. Just as in dead bodies worms are <lb n="941" />
            engendered by putrefaction so in the souls of the lost there <lb n="942" />
            arises a perpetual remorse from the putrefaction of sin, the <lb n="943" />
            sting of conscience, the worm, as Pope Innocent the Third calls <lb n="944" />
            it, of the triple sting. The first sting inflicted by this cruel worm <lb n="945" />
            will be the memory of past pleasures. O what a dreadful mem- <lb n="946" />
            ory will that be! In the lake of alldevouring flame the proud <lb n="947" />
            king will remember the pomps of his court, the wise but wicked <lb n="948" />
            man his libraries and instruments of research, the lover of ar- <lb n="949" />
            tistic pleasures his marbles and pictures and other art treasures, <lb n="950" />
            he who delighted in the pleasures of the table his gorgeous <lb n="951" />
            feasts, his dishes prepared with such delicacy, his choice wines; <lb n="952" />
            the miser will remember his hoard of gold, the robber his <lb n="953" />
            illgotten wealth, the angry and revengeful and merciless mur- <lb n="954" />
            derers their deeds of blood and violence in which they revelled, <lb n="955" />
            the impure and adulterous the unspeakable and filthy pleasures <lb n="956" />
            in which they delighted. They will remember all this and loathe <lb n="957" />
            themselves and their sins. For how miserable will all those <lb n="958" />
            pleasures seem to the soul condemned to suffer in hellfire for <lb n="959" />
            ages and ages. How they will rage and fume to think that they <lb n="960" />
            have lost the bliss of heaven for the dross of earth, for a few <lb n="961" />
            pieces of metal, for vain honours, for bodily comforts, for a <lb n="962" />
            tingling of the nerves. They will repent indeed: and this is the <lb n="963" />
            second sting of the worm of conscience, a late and fruitless <lb n="964" />
            sorrow for sins committed. Divine justice insists that the under- <lb n="965" />
            standing of those miserable wretches be fixed continually on <lb n="966" />
            the sins of which they were guilty and, moreover, as saint <lb n="967" />
            Augustine points out, God will impart to them His own <lb n="968" />
            knowledge of sin so that sin will appear to them in all its <lb n="969" />
            hideous malice as it appears to the eyes of God Himself. They <lb n="970" />
            will behold their sins in all their foulness and repent but it will <lb n="971" />
            be too late and then they will bewail the good occasions which <lb n="972" />
            they neglected. This is the last and deepest and most cruel sting <lb n="973" />
            of the worm of conscience. The conscience will say: You had <lb n="974" />
            time and opportunity to repent and would not. You were <lb n="975" />
            brought up religiously by your parents. You had the sacraments <lb n="976" />
            and graces and indulgences of the church to aid you. You had <lb n="977" />
            the minister of God to preach to you, to call you back when <lb n="978" />
            you had strayed, to forgive you your sins, no matter how many, <lb n="979" />
            how abominable, if only you had confessed and repented. No. <lb n="980" />
            You would not. You flouted the ministers of holy religion, you <lb n="981" />
            turned your back on the confessional, you wallowed deeper <lb n="982" />
            and deeper in the mire of sin. God appealed to you, threatened <lb n="983" />
            you, entreated you to return to Him. O what shame, what <lb n="984" />
            misery! The ruler of the universe entreated you, a creature <lb n="985" />
            of clay, to love Him Who  made you and to keep His law. <lb n="986" />
            No. You would not. And now, though you were to flood all <lb n="987" />
            hell with your tears if you could still weep, all that sea of <lb n="988" />
            repentance would not gain for you what a single tear of true <lb n="989" />
            repentance shed during your mortal life would have gained for <lb n="990" />
            you. You implore now a moment of earthly life wherein to <lb n="991" />
            repent: in vain. That time is gone: gone for ever.<lb n="992" /> </said>
             <said who="Father Arnall">&#8213;Such is the threefold sting of conscience, the viper which <lb n="993" />
            gnaws the very heart's core of the wretches in hell so that filled <lb n="994" />
            with hellish fury they curse themselves for their folly and curse <lb n="995" />
            the evil companions who have brought them to such ruin and <lb n="996" />
            curse the devils who tempted them in life and now mock them <lb n="997" />
            and torture them in eternity and even revile and curse the <lb n="998" />
            Supreme Being Whose goodness and patience they scorned and <lb n="999" />
            slighted but Whose justice and power they cannot evade.<lb n="1000" /> </said>
             <said who="Father Arnall">&#8213;The next spiritual pain to which the damned are subjected is <lb n="1001" />
            the pain of extension. Man, in this earthly life, though he be <lb n="1002" />
            capable of many evils, is not capable of them all at once inas- <lb n="1003" />
            much as one evil corrects and counteracts  another just as one <lb n="1004" />
            poison frequently corrects another. In hell on the contrary one <lb n="1005" />
            torment, instead of counteracting another, lends it still greater <lb n="1006" />
            force: and moreover as the internal faculties are more perfect <lb n="1007" />
            than the external senses so are they more capable of suffering. <lb n="1008" />
            Just as every sense is afflicted with a fitting torment so is every <lb n="1009" />
            spiritual faculty; the fancy with horrible images, the sensitive <lb n="1010" />
            faculty with alternate longing and rage, the mind and under- <lb n="1011" />
            standing with an interior darkness more terrible even than the <lb n="1012" />
            exterior darkness which reigns in that dreadful prison. The <lb n="1013" />
            malice, impotent though it be, which possesses these demon <lb n="1014" />
            souls is an evil of boundless extension, of limitless duration, a <lb n="1015" />
            frightful state of wickedness which we can scarcely realise <lb n="1016" />
            unless we bear in mind the enormity of sin and the hatred God <lb n="1017" />
            bears to it.<lb n="1018" /> </said>
             <said who="Father Arnall">&#8213;Opposed to this pain of extension and yet coexistent with it <lb n="1019" />
            we have the pain of intensity. Hell is the centre of all evils and, <lb n="1020" />
            as you know, things are more intense at their centres than at <lb n="1021" />
            their remotest points. There are no contraries or admixtures of <lb n="1022" />
            any kind to temper or soften in the least the pains of hell. Nay, <lb n="1023" />
            things which are good in themselves become evil in hell. Com- <lb n="1024" />
            pany, elsewhere a source of comfort to the afflicted, will be <lb n="1025" />
            there a continual torment: knowledge, so much longed for as <lb n="1026" />
            the chief good of the intellect, will there be hated worse than <lb n="1027" />
            ignorance: light, so much coveted by all creatures from the lord <lb n="1028" />
            of creation down to the humblest plant in the forest, will be <lb n="1029" />
            loathed intensely. In this life our sorrows are either not very <lb n="1030" />
            long or not very great because nature either overcomes them by <lb n="1031" />
            habits or puts an end to them by sinking under their weight. <lb n="1032" />
            But in hell the torments cannot be overcome by habit for while <lb n="1033" />
            they are of terrible intensity they are at the same time of con- <lb n="1034" />
            tinual variety, each pain, so to speak, taking fire from another <lb n="1035" />
            and reendowing that which has enkindled it with a still fiercer <lb n="1036" />
            flame. Nor can nature escape from these intense and various <lb n="1037" />
            tortures by succumbing to them for the soul in hell is sustained <lb n="1038" />
            and maintained in evil so that its suffering may be the greater. <lb n="1039" />
            Boundless extension of torment, incredible intensity of suffer- <lb n="1040" />
            ing, unceasing variety of torture &#8211; this is what the divine <lb n="1041" />
            majesty, so outraged by sinners, demands, this is what the <lb n="1042" />
            holiness of heaven, slighted and set aside for the lustful and low <lb n="1043" />
            pleasures of the corrupt flesh, requires, this is what the blood <lb n="1044" />
            of the innocent Lamb of God, shed for the redemption of <lb n="1045" />
            sinners, trampled upon by the vilest of the vile, insists upon.<lb n="1046" /> </said>
             <said who="Father Arnall">&#8213;Last and crowning torture of all the tortures of that awful <lb n="1047" />
            place is the eternity of hell. Eternity! O dread and dire word. <lb n="1048" />
            Eternity! What mind of man can understand it? And, remem- <lb n="1049" />
            ber, it is an eternity of pain. Even though the pains of hell were <lb n="1050" />
            not so terrible as they are yet they would become infinite as <lb n="1051" />
            they are destined to last for ever. But while they are everlasting <lb n="1052" />
            they are at the same time, as you know, intolerably intense, <lb n="1053" />
            unbearably extensive. To bear even the sting of an insect for  all <lb n="1054" />
            eternity would be a dreadful torment. What must it be then to <lb n="1055" />
            bear the manifold tortures of hell for ever. For ever! For all <lb n="1056" />
            eternity! Not for a year or for an age but for ever. Try to <lb n="1057" />
            imagine the awful meaning of this. You have often seen the <lb n="1058" />
            sand on the seashore. How fine are its tiny grains! And how <lb n="1059" />
            many of those tiny little grains go to make up the small handful <lb n="1060" />
            which a child grasps in its play. Now imagine a mountain of <lb n="1061" />
            that sand, a million miles high, reaching from the earth to the <lb n="1062" />
            farthest heavens, and a million miles broad, extending to re- <lb n="1063" />
            motest space, and a million miles in thickness: and imagine <lb n="1064" />
            such an enormous mass of countless particles of sand multi- <lb n="1065" />
            plied as often as there are leaves in the forest, drops of water in <lb n="1066" />
            the mighty ocean, feathers on birds, scales on fish, hairs on <lb n="1067" />
            animals, atoms in the vast expanse of the air: and imagine that <lb n="1068" />
            at the end of every million years a little bird came to that <lb n="1069" />
            mountain and carried away in its beak a tiny grain of that sand. <lb n="1070" />
            How many millions upon millions of centuries would pass be- <lb n="1071" />
            fore that bird had carried away even a square foot of that <lb n="1072" />
            mountain, how many eons upon eons of ages before it had <lb n="1073" />
            carried away all. Yet at the end of that immense stretch of time <lb n="1074" />
            not even one instant of eternity could be said to have ended. At <lb n="1075" />
            the end of all those billions and trillions of years eternity would <lb n="1076" />
            have scarcely begun. And if that mountain rose again after it <lb n="1077" />
            had been all carried away and if the bird came again and <lb n="1078" />
            carried it all away again grain by grain: and if it so rose and <lb n="1079" />
            sank as many times as there are stars in the sky, atoms in the <lb n="1080" />
            air, drops of water in the sea, leaves on the trees, feathers upon <lb n="1081" />
            birds, scales upon fish, hairs upon animals, at the end of all <lb n="1082" />
            those innumerable risings and sinkings of that immeasurably <lb n="1083" />
            vast mountain not one single instant of eternity could be said to <lb n="1084" />
            have ended: even then, at the end of such a period, after that <lb n="1085" />
            eon of time the mere thought of which makes our very brain <lb n="1086" />
            reel dizzily, eternity would have scarcely begun.<lb n="1087" /> </said>
             <said who="Father Arnall">&#8213;A holy saint (one of our own fathers I believe it was) was <lb n="1088" />
            once vouchsafed a vision of hell. It seemed to him that he stood <lb n="1089" />
            in the midst of a great hall, dark and silent save for the ticking <lb n="1090" />
            of a great clock. The ticking went on unceasingly; and it <lb n="1091" />
            seemed to this saint that the sound of the ticking was the <lb n="1092" />
            ceaseless repetition of the words: ever, never; ever, never. Ever <lb n="1093" />
            to be in hell, never to be in heaven; ever to be shut off from the <lb n="1094" />
            presence of God, never to enjoy the beatific vision; ever to be <lb n="1095" />
            eaten with flames, gnawed by vermin, goaded with burning <lb n="1096" />
            spikes, never to be free from those pains; ever to have the <lb n="1097" />
            conscience upbraid one, the memory enrage, the mind filled <lb n="1098" />
            with darkness and despair, never to escape; ever to curse and <lb n="1099" />
            revile the foul demons who gloat fiendishly over the misery of <lb n="1100" />
            their dupes, never to behold the shining raiment of the blessed <lb n="1101" />
            spirits; ever to cry out of the abyss of fire to God for an instant, <lb n="1102" />
            a single instant, of respite from such awful agony, never to <lb n="1103" />
            receive, even for an instant, God's pardon; ever to suffer, never <lb n="1104" />
            to enjoy; ever to be damned, never to be saved; ever, never; <lb n="1105" />
            ever, never. O what a dreadful punishment! An eternity of <lb n="1106" />
            endless agony, of endless bodily and spiritual torment, without <lb n="1107" />
            one ray of hope, without one moment of cessation, of agony <lb n="1108" />
            limitless in extent, limitless in intensity, of torment infinitely <lb n="1109" />
            lasting, infinitely varied, of torture that sustains eternally that <lb n="1110" />
            which it eternally devours, of anguish that everlastingly preys <lb n="1111" />
            upon the spirit while it racks the flesh, an eternity, every instant <lb n="1112" />
            of which is itself an eternity, and that eternity an eternity of <lb n="1113" />
            woe. Such is the terrible punishment decreed for those who die <lb n="1114" />
            in mortal sin by an almighty and a just God.<lb n="1115" /> </said>
             <said who="Father Arnall">&#8213;Yes, a just God! Men, reasoning always as men, are aston- <lb n="1116" />
            ished that God should mete out an everlasting and infinite pun- <lb n="1117" />
            ishment in the fires of hell for a single grievous sin. They <lb n="1118" />
            reason thus because, blinded by the gross illusion of the flesh <lb n="1119" />
            and the darkness of human understanding, they are unable to <lb n="1120" />
            comprehend the hideous malice of mortal sin. They reason thus <lb n="1121" />
            because they are unable to comprehend that even venial sin is <lb n="1122" />
            of such a foul and hideous nature that even if the omnipotent <lb n="1123" />
            Creator could end all the evil and misery in the world, the <lb n="1124" />
            wars, the diseases, the robberies, the crimes, the deaths, the <lb n="1125" />
            murders, on condition that He allowed a single venial sin to <lb n="1126" />
            pass unpunished, a single venial sin, a lie, an angry look, a <lb n="1127" />
            moment of wilful sloth, He, the great omnipotent God could <lb n="1128" />
            not do so because sin, be it in thought or deed, is a trans- <lb n="1129" />
            gression of His law and God would not be God if He did not <lb n="1130" />
            punish the transgressor.<lb n="1131" /> </said>
             <said who="Father Arnall">&#8213;A sin, an instant of rebellious pride of the intellect, made <lb n="1132" />
            Lucifer and a third part of the cohorts of angels fall from their <lb n="1133" />
            glory. A sin, an instant of folly and weakness, drove Adam and <lb n="1134" />
            Eve out of Eden and brought death and suffering into the <lb n="1135" />
            world. To retrieve the consequences of that sin the onlybegot- <lb n="1136" />
            ten Son of God came down to earth, lived and suffered and <lb n="1137" />
            died a most painful death, hanging for three hours on the cross.<lb n="1138" /> </said>
             <said who="Father Arnall">&#8213;O, my dear little brethren in Christ Jesus, will we then <lb n="1139" />
            offend that good Redeemer and provoke His anger? Will we <lb n="1140" />
            trample again upon that torn and mangled corpse? Will we spit <lb n="1141" />
            upon that face so full of sorrow and love? Will we too, like the <lb n="1142" />
            cruel jews and the brutal soldiers, mock that gentle and com- <lb n="1143" />
            passionate Saviour Who trod alone for our sakes the awful <lb n="1144" />
            winepress of sorrow? Every word of sin is a wound in His <lb n="1145" />
            tender side. Every sinful act is a thorn piercing His head. Every <lb n="1146" />
            impure thought, deliberately yielded to, is a keen lance trans- <lb n="1147" />
            fixing that sacred and loving heart. No, no. It is impossible for <lb n="1148" />
            any human being to do that which offends so deeply the divine <lb n="1149" />
            majesty, that which is punished by an eternity of agony, that <lb n="1150" />
            which crucifies again the Son of God and makes a mockery of <lb n="1151" />
            Him.<lb n="1152" /> </said>
             <said who="Father Arnall">&#8213;I pray to God that my poor words may have availed today to <lb n="1153" />
            confirm in holiness those who are in a state of grace, to <lb n="1154" />
            strengthen the wavering, to lead back to the state of grace the <lb n="1155" />
            poor soul that has strayed if any such be among you. I pray to <lb n="1156" />
            God, and do you pray with me, that we may repent of our sins. <lb n="1157" />
            I will ask you now, all of you, to repeat after me the act of <lb n="1158" />
            contrition, kneeling here in this humble chapel in the presence <lb n="1159" />
            of God. He is there in the tabernacle burning with love for <lb n="1160" />
            mankind, ready to comfort the afflicted. Be not afraid. No <lb n="1161" />
            matter how many or how foul the sins if only you repent of <lb n="1162" />
            them they will be forgiven you. Let no worldly shame hold you <lb n="1163" />
            back. God is still the merciful Lord Who wishes not the eternal <lb n="1164" />
            death of the sinner but rather that he be converted and live.<lb n="1165" /> </said>
             <said who="Father Arnall">&#8213;He calls you to Him. You are His. He made you out of <lb n="1166" />
            nothing. He loved you as only a God can love. His arms are <lb n="1167" />
            open to receive you even though you have sinned against Him. <lb n="1168" />
            Come to Him, poor sinner, poor vain and erring sinner. Now is <lb n="1169" />
            the acceptable time. Now is the hour.<lb n="1170" /></said> </p>
            <p> The priest rose and turning towards the altar knelt upon the <lb n="1171" />
            step before the tabernacle in the fallen gloom. He waited till all <lb n="1172" />
            in the chapel had knelt and every least noise was still. Then <lb n="1173" />
            raising his head he repeated the act of contrition, phrase by <lb n="1174" />
            phrase, with fervour. The boys answered him phrase by phrase. <lb n="1175" />
            Stephen, his tongue cleaving to his palate, bowed his head, <lb n="1176" />
            praying with his heart.<lb n="1177" /> </p>

            <p> He  went up to his room after dinner in order to be alone <lb n="1202" />
            with his soul: and at every step his soul seemed  to sigh: at every <lb n="1203" />
            step his soul mounted with his feet, sighing in the ascent, <lb n="1204" />
            through a region of viscid gloom.<lb n="1205" /> </p>
            <p> He halted on the landing before the door  and then, grasping <lb n="1206" />
            the porcelain knob, opened the door quickly. He waited in fear, <lb n="1207" />
            his soul pining within him, praying silently that death might <lb n="1208" />
            not touch his brow as he passed over the threshold,  that the <lb n="1209" />
            fiends that inhabit darkness might not be given power over <lb n="1210" />
            him. He waited still at the threshold  as at the entrance to some <lb n="1211" />
            dark cave. Faces were there; eyes: they waited and watched. <lb n="1212" />
             <said who="murmuring faces">&#8213;We knew perfectly well of course that though it was bound <lb n="1213" />
            to come to the light he would find considerable difficulty in <lb n="1214" />
            endeavouring to try to induce himself to try to endeavour to <lb n="1215" />
            ascertain the spiritual plenipotentiary and so we knew of <lb n="1216" />
            course perfectly well&#8212;<lb n="1217" /></said> </p>
            <p> Murmuring faces waited and watched;  murmurous voices <lb n="1218" />
            filled the dark shell of the cave. He feared intensely in spirit <lb n="1219" />
            and in flesh but, raising his head bravely, he strode into the <lb n="1220" />
            room firmly. A doorway, a room, the same room, same win- <lb n="1221" />
            dow. He told himself calmly that those words had absolutely <lb n="1222" />
            no sense which had seemed to rise murmurously from the dark. <lb n="1223" />
            He told himself that it was simply his room with the door <lb n="1224" />
            open.<lb n="1225" /> </p>
            <p> He closed the door and, walking swiftly to the bed, knelt <lb n="1226" />
            beside it and covered his face with his hands. His hands were <lb n="1227" />
            cold and damp and his limbs ached with chill. Bodily unrest <lb n="1228" />
            and chill and weariness beset him, routing his thoughts. Why <lb n="1229" />
            was he kneeling there like a child saying his evening prayers? <lb n="1230" />
            To be alone with his soul, to examine his conscience, to meet <lb n="1231" />
            his sins face to face, to recall their times and manners and <lb n="1232" />
            circumstances, to weep over them. He could not weep. He <lb n="1233" />
            could not summon them to his memory. He felt only an ache of <lb n="1234" />
            soul and body, his whole being, memory, will, understanding, <lb n="1235" />
            flesh, benumbed and weary.<lb n="1236" /> </p>
            <p> That was the work of devils, to scatter his thoughts and <lb n="1237" />
            overcloud his conscience, assailing him at the gates of the cow- <lb n="1238" />
            ardly and sincorrupted flesh: and, praying God timidly to <lb n="1239" />
            forgive him his weakness, he crawled up on to the bed and, <lb n="1240" />
            wrapping the blankets closely about him, covered his face again <lb n="1241" />
            with his hands. He had  sinned. He had sinned so deeply against <lb n="1242" />
            heaven and before God that he was not worthy to be called <lb n="1243" />
            God's child.<lb n="1244" /> </p>
            <p> Could it be that he, Stephen Dedalus, had done those things? <lb n="1245" />
            His conscience sighed in answer. Yes, he had done them, se- <lb n="1246" />
            cretly, filthily, time after time, and, hardened in sinful impeni- <lb n="1247" />
            tence, he had dared to wear the mask of holiness before the <lb n="1248" />
            tabernacle itself while his soul within was a living mass of <lb n="1249" />
            corruption. How came it that God had not struck him dead? <lb n="1250" />
            The leprous company of his sins closed about him, breathing <lb n="1251" />
            upon him, bending over him from all sides. He strove to forget <lb n="1252" />
            them in an act of prayer, huddling his limbs closer  together and <lb n="1253" />
            binding down his eyelids: but the senses of the soul would not <lb n="1254" />
            be bound and, though his eyes were shut fast, he saw the places <lb n="1255" />
            where he had sinned and, though his ears were tightly covered, <lb n="1256" />
            he heard. He desired with all his will not to hear or see. He <lb n="1257" />
            desired till his frame shook under the strain of his desire and <lb n="1258" />
            until the senses of his soul closed. They closed for an instant <lb n="1259" />
            and then opened. He saw.<lb n="1260" /> </p>
            <p> A field of stiff weeds and thistles and tufted nettlebunches. <lb n="1261" />
            Thick among the tufts of rank stiff growth lay battered canis- <lb n="1262" />
            ters and clots and coils of solid excrement. A faint marshlight <lb n="1263" />
            struggled upwards from all the ordure through the bristling <lb n="1264" />
            greygreen weeds. An evil smell, faint and foul as the light, <lb n="1265" />
            curled upwards sluggishly out of the canisters and from the <lb n="1266" />
            stale crusted dung.<lb n="1267" /> </p>
            <p> Creatures were in the field; one, three, six: creatures were <lb n="1268" />
            moving in the field, hither and thither. Goatish creatures with <lb n="1269" />
            human faces, hornybrowed, lightly bearded and grey as india- <lb n="1270" />
            rubber. The malice of evil glittered in their hard eyes, as they <lb n="1271" />
            moved hither and thither, trailing their long tails behind them. <lb n="1272" />
            A rictus of cruel malignity lit up greyly their old bony faces. <lb n="1273" />
            One was clasping about his ribs a torn flannel waistcoat, an- <lb n="1274" />
            other complained monotonously as his beard stuck in the <lb n="1275" />
            tufted weeds. Soft language issued from their spittleless lips as <lb n="1276" />
            they swished in slow circles round and round the field, winding <lb n="1277" />
            hither and thither through the weeds, dragging their long tails <lb n="1278" />
            amid the rattling canisters. They moved in slow circles, circling <lb n="1279" />
            closer and closer, to enclose, to  enclose, soft language issuing <lb n="1280" />
            from their lips, their long swishing tails  besmeared with stale <lb n="1281" />
            shite, thrusting upwards their terrific faces .....<lb n="1282" /> </p>
            <p> Help!<lb n="1283" /> </p>
            <p> He flung the blankets from him madly to free his face and <lb n="1284" />
            neck. That was his hell. God had allowed him to see the hell <lb n="1285" />
            reserved for his sins: stinking, bestial, malignant, a hell of lech- <lb n="1286" />
            erous goatish fiends. For him! For him!<lb n="1287" /> </p>
            <p> He sprang from the bed, the reeking odour pouring down <lb n="1288" />
            his throat, clogging and revolting his entrails. Air! The air of <lb n="1289" />
            heaven! He stumbled towards the window, groaning and al- <lb n="1290" />
            most fainting with sickness. At the washstand a convulsion <lb n="1291" />
            seized him within: and, clasping his cold forehead wildly, he <lb n="1292" />
            vomited profusely in agony.<lb n="1293" /> </p>
            <p> When the fit had spent itself he walked weakly to the win- <lb n="1294" />
            dow and, lifting the sash, sat in a corner of the embrasure and <lb n="1295" />
            leaned his elbow upon the sill. The rain had drawn off; and <lb n="1296" />
            amid the moving vapours from point to point of light the city <lb n="1297" />
            was spinning about herself a soft cocoon of yellowish haze. <lb n="1298" />
            Heaven was still and faintly luminous and the air sweet to <lb n="1299" />
            breathe, as in a thicket drenched with showers: and amid peace <lb n="1300" />
            and shimmering lights and quiet fragrances he made a covenant <lb n="1301" />
            with his heart.<lb n="1302" /> </p>
            <p> He prayed: <lb n="1303" />
             <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;<emph>He once had meant to come on earth in heavenly glory but <lb n="1304" />
            we sinned: and then He could not safely visit us but with a <lb n="1305" />
            shrouded majesty and a bedimmed radiance for He was God. <lb n="1306" />
            So He came Himself in weakness not in power and He sent <lb n="1307" />
            thee, a creature in His stead, with a creature's comeliness and <lb n="1308" />
            lustre suited to our state. And now thy very face and form, dear <lb n="1309" />
            mother, speak to us of the Eternal; not like earthly beauty, <lb n="1310" />
            dangerous to look upon, but like the morning star which is thy <lb n="1311" />
            emblem, bright and musical, breathing purity, telling of heaven <lb n="1312" />
            and infusing peace. O harbinger of day! O light of the pilgrim! <lb n="1313" />
            Lead us still as thou hast led. In the dark night, across the bleak <lb n="1314" />
            wilderness guide us on to our Lord Jesus, guide us home.</emph><lb n="1315" /></said> </p>
            <p>His eyes were dimmed with tears and, looking humbly up to <lb n="1316" />
            heaven, he wept for the innocence he had lost.<lb n="1317" /> </p>
            <p> When evening had fallen he left the house and the first touch <lb n="1318" />
            of the damp dark air and the noise of the door as it closed <lb n="1319" />
            behind him made ache again his conscience, lulled by prayer <lb n="1320" />
            and tears. Confess! Confess! It was not enough to lull the con- <lb n="1321" />
            science with a tear and a prayer. He had to kneel before the <lb n="1322" />
            minister of the Holy Ghost and tell over his hidden sins truly <lb n="1323" />
            and repentantly. Before he heard again the footboard of the <lb n="1324" />
            housedoor trail over the threshold  as it opened to let him in, <lb n="1325" />
            before he saw again the table in the kitchen set for supper he <lb n="1326" />
            would have knelt and confessed. It was quite simple.<lb n="1327" /> </p>
            <p> The ache of conscience ceased and he walked onward swiftly <lb n="1328" />
            through the dark streets. There were so many flagstones on the <lb n="1329" />
            footpath of that street and so many streets in that city and so <lb n="1330" />
            many cities in the world. Yet eternity had no end. He was in <lb n="1331" />
            mortal sin. Even once was a mortal sin. It could happen in an <lb n="1332" />
            instant. But how so quickly? By seeing or by thinking of seeing. <lb n="1333" />
            The eyes see the thing, without having wished first to see. Then <lb n="1334" />
            in an instant it happens. But does that part of the body under- <lb n="1335" />
            stand or what? The serpent, the most subtle beast of the field. <lb n="1336" />
            It must understand when it desires in one instant and then <lb n="1337" />
            prolongs its own desire instant after instant, sinfully. It feels <lb n="1338" />
            and understands and desires. What a horrible thing! Who made <lb n="1339" />
            it to be like that, a bestial part of the body able to understand <lb n="1340" />
            bestially and desire bestially? Was that then he or an inhuman <lb n="1341" />
            thing moved by a lower soul than his soul? His soul sickened at <lb n="1342" />
            the thought of a torpid snaky life feeding itself out of the tender <lb n="1343" />
            marrow of his life and fattening upon the slime of lust. O why <lb n="1344" />
            was that so? O why?<lb n="1345" /> </p>
            <p> He cowered in the shadow of the thought, abasing himself in <lb n="1346" />
            the awe of God  Who had made all things and all men. Mad- <lb n="1347" />
            ness. Who could think such a thought? And, cowering in <lb n="1348" />
            darkness and abject, he prayed mutely to his angel guardian to <lb n="1349" />
            drive away with his sword the demon that was whispering to <lb n="1350" />
            his brain.<lb n="1351" /> </p>
            <p> The whisper ceased and he knew then clearly that his own <lb n="1352" />
            soul had sinned in thought and word and deed wilfully through <lb n="1353" />
            his own body. Confess! He had to confess every sin. How could <lb n="1354" />
            he utter in words to the priest what he had done? Must, must. <lb n="1355" />
            Or how could he explain without dying of shame? Or how <lb n="1356" />
            could he have done such things without shame? A madman, a <lb n="1357" />
            loathsome madman! Confess! O he would indeed to be free and <lb n="1358" />
            sinless again! Perhaps the priest would know. O dear God!<lb n="1359" /> </p>
            <p> He walked on and on through illlit  streets, fearing to stand <lb n="1360" />
            still for a moment lest it might seem that he held back from <lb n="1361" />
            what awaited him, fearing to arrive at that towards which he <lb n="1362" />
            still turned with longing. How beautiful must be a soul in the <lb n="1363" />
            state of grace when God looked upon it with love!<lb n="1364" /> </p>
            <p> Frowsy girls sat along the curbstones before their baskets. <lb n="1365" />
            Their dank hair hung trailed  over their brows. They were not <lb n="1366" />
            beautiful to see as they crouched in the mire. But their souls <lb n="1367" />
            were seen by God; and if their souls were in a state of grace <lb n="1368" />
            they were radiant to see: and God loved them, seeing them.<lb n="1369" /> </p>
            <p> A wasting breath of humiliation blew bleakly over his soul <lb n="1370" />
            to think of how he had fallen, to feel that those souls were <lb n="1371" />
            dearer to God than his. The wind blew over him and passed on <lb n="1372" />
            to the myriads and myriads of other souls on whom God's <lb n="1373" />
            favour shone now  more and now less, stars now brighter and <lb n="1374" />
            now dimmer, sustained  and failing. And the glimmering souls <lb n="1375" />
            passed away, sustained and failing, merged in a moving breath. <lb n="1376" />
            One soul was lost; a tiny soul: his. It flickered once and went <lb n="1377" />
            out, forgotten, lost. The end: black cold void waste.<lb n="1378" /> </p>
            <p> Consciousness of place came ebbing back to him slowly over <lb n="1379" />
            a vast tract of time unlit, unfelt, unlived. The squalid scene <lb n="1380" />
            composed itself around him; the common accents, the burning <lb n="1381" />
            gasjets in the shops, odours of fish and spirits and wet sawdust, <lb n="1382" />
            moving men and women. An old woman was about to cross <lb n="1383" />
            the street, an oilcan in her hand. He bent down and asked her <lb n="1384" />
            was there a chapel near. <lb n="1385" />
            <said who="an old woman">&#8213;A chapel, sir? Yes, sir. Church Street chapel.<lb n="386" /> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;Church?<lb n="1387" /></said> </p>
            <p> She shifted the can to her other hand and directed him: and, <lb n="1388" />
            as she held out her reeking withered right hand under its fringe <lb n="1389" />
            of shawl, he bent lower towards her, saddened and soothed by <lb n="1390" />
            her voice. <lb n="1391" />
             <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;Thank you.<lb n="1392" /> </said>
            <said who="an old woman">&#8213;You are quite  welcome, sir.<lb n="1393" /></said> </p>
            <p> The candles on the high altar had been extinguished but the <lb n="1394" />
            fragrance of incense still floated down the dim nave. Bearded <lb n="1395" />
            workmen with pious faces were guiding a canopy out through <lb n="1396" />
            a sidedoor, the sacristan aiding them with quiet gestures and <lb n="1397" />
            words. A few of the faithful still lingered, praying before one of <lb n="1398" />
            the sidealtars or kneeling in the benches near the confessionals. <lb n="1399" />
            He approached timidly and knelt at the last bench in the body, <lb n="1400" />
            thankful for the peace and silence and fragrant shadow of the <lb n="1401" />
            church. The board on which he knelt was narrow and worn <lb n="1402" />
            and those who knelt near him were humble followers of Jesus. <lb n="1403" />
            Jesus too had been born in poverty and had worked in the shop <lb n="1404" />
            of a carpenter, cutting boards and planing them, and had first <lb n="1405" />
            spoken of the kingdom of God to poor fishermen, teaching all <lb n="1406" />
            men to be meek and humble of heart.<lb n="1407" /> </p>
            <p> He bowed his head upon his hands, bidding his heart be <lb n="1408" />
            meek and humble that he might be like those who knelt beside <lb n="1409" />
            him and his prayer as acceptable as theirs. He prayed beside <lb n="1410" />
            them but it was hard. His soul was foul with sin and he dared <lb n="1411" />
            not ask forgiveness with the simple trust of those whom Jesus, <lb n="1412" />
            in the mysterious ways of God, had called first to His side, the <lb n="1413" />
            carpenters, the fishermen, poor and simple people  following a <lb n="1414" />
            lowly trade, handling and shaping the wood of trees, mending <lb n="1415" />
            their nets with patience.<lb n="1416" /> </p>
            <p> A tall figure came down the aisle and the penitents stirred: <lb n="1417" />
            and, at the last moment glancing up swiftly, he saw a long grey <lb n="1418" />
            beard and the brown habit of a capuchin. The priest entered <lb n="1419" />
            the box and was hidden. Two penitents rose and entered the <lb n="1420" />
            confessional at either side. The wooden slide was drawn back <lb n="1421" />
            and the faint murmur of a voice troubled the silence.<lb n="1422" /> </p>
            <p> His blood began to murmur in his veins, murmuring like a <lb n="1423" />
            sinful city summoned from its sleep to hear its doom. Little <lb n="1424" />
            flakes of fire fell and powdery ashes fell softly, alighting on the <lb n="1425" />
            houses of men. They stirred, waking from sleep, troubled by <lb n="1426" />
            the heated air.<lb n="1427" /> </p>
            <p> The slide was shot back. The penitent emerged from the side <lb n="1428" />
            of the box. The farther slide was drawn. A woman entered <lb n="1429" />
            quietly and deftly where the first penitent had knelt. The faint <lb n="1430" />
            murmur began again.<lb n="1431" /> </p>
            <p> He could still leave the chapel. He could stand up, put one <lb n="1432" />
            foot before the other and walk out softly and then run, run, run <lb n="1433" />
            swiftly through the dark streets. He could still escape from the <lb n="1434" />
            shame. O what shame! His face was burning with shame. Had <lb n="1435" />
            it been any terrible crime but that one sin! Had it been murder! <lb n="1436" />
            Little fiery flakes fell and touched him at all points, shameful <lb n="1437" />
            thoughts, shameful words, shameful acts. Shame covered him <lb n="1438" />
            wholly like fine glowing ashes falling continually. To say it in <lb n="1439" />
            words! His soul, stifling and helpless, would cease to be.<lb n="1440" /> </p>
            <p> The slide was shot back. A penitent emerged from the far- <lb n="1441" />
            ther side of the box. The near slide was drawn. A penitent <lb n="1442" />
            entered where the other penitent had come out. A soft whisper- <lb n="1443" />
            ing noise floated in vaporous cloudlets out of the box. It was <lb n="1444" />
            the woman: soft whispering cloudlets, soft whispering vapour, <lb n="1445" />
            whispering and vanishing.<lb n="1446" /> </p>
            <p> He beat his breast with his fist humbly, secretly under cover <lb n="1447" />
            of the wooden armrest. He would be at one with others and <lb n="1448" />
            with God. He would love his neighbour. He would love God <lb n="1449" />
            Who had made and loved him. He would kneel and pray with <lb n="1450" />
            others and be happy. God would look down on him and on <lb n="1451" />
            them and would love them all.<lb n="1452" /> </p>
            <p> It was easy to be good. God's yoke was sweet and light. It <lb n="1453" />
            was better never to have sinned, to have remained always a <lb n="1454" />
            child, for God loved little children and suffered them to come <lb n="1455" />
            to Him. It was a terrible and a sad thing to sin. But God was <lb n="1456" />
            merciful to poor sinners who were truly sorry. How true that <lb n="1457" />
            was! That was indeed goodness.<lb n="1458" /> </p>
            <p> The slide was shot to suddenly. The penitent came out. He <lb n="1459" />
            was next. He stood up in terror and walked blindly into the <lb n="1460" />
            box.<lb n="1461" /> </p>
            <p> At last it had come. He knelt in the silent gloom and raised <lb n="1462" />
            his eyes to the white crucifix suspended above him. God could <lb n="1463" />
            see that he was sorry. He would tell all his sins. His confession <lb n="1464" />
            would be long, long. Everybody in the chapel would know then <lb n="1465" />
            what a sinner he had been. Let them know. It was true. But <lb n="1466" />
            God had promised to forgive him if he was sorry. He was <lb n="1467" />
            sorry. He clasped his hands and raised them towards the white <lb n="1468" />
            form, praying with his darkened eyes, praying with all his <lb n="1469" />
            trembling body, swaying his head to and fro like a lost crea- <lb n="1470" />
            ture, praying with whimpering lips. <lb n="1471" />
             <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;Sorry! Sorry! O sorry!<lb n="1472" /></said> </p>
            <p> The slide clicked back and his heart bounded in his breast. <lb n="1473" />
            The face of an old priest was at the grating, averted from him, <lb n="1474" />
            leaning upon a hand. He made the sign of the cross and prayed <lb n="1475" />
            of the priest to bless him for he had sinned. Then, bowing his <lb n="1476" />
            head, he repeated the <seg xml:lang="la">Confiteor</seg> in fright. At the words <emph>my</emph> <lb n="1477" />
            <emph>most grievous fault</emph> he ceased, breathless. <lb n="1478" />
            <said who="Priest">&#8213;How long is it since your last confession, my child?<lb n="1479" /> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;A long time, father.<lb n="1480" /> </said>
            <said who="Priest">&#8213;A month, my child?<lb n="1481" /> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">Longer, father.<lb n="1482" /> </said>
            <said who="Priest">Three months, my child?<lb n="1483" /> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;Longer, father.<lb n="1484" /> </said>
            <said who="Priest">&#8213;Six months?<lb n="1485" /> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;Eight months, father.<lb n="1486" /></said> </p>
            <p> He had begun. The priest asked: <lb n="1487" />
            <said who="Priest">&#8213;And what do you remember since that time?<lb n="1488" /></said> </p>
            <p> He began to confess his sins: masses missed, prayers not <lb n="1489" />
            said, lies. <lb n="1490" />
            <said who="Priest">&#8213;Anything else, my child?<lb n="1491" /></said> </p>
            <p> Sins of anger, envy of  others, gluttony, vanity, disobedience. <lb n="1492" />
            <said who="Priest">&#8213;Anything else, my child?<lb n="1493" /> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;Sloth.<lb n="1494" /> </said>
            <said who="Priest">&#8213;Anything else, my child?<lb n="1495" /></said> </p>
            <p> There was no help. He murmured: <lb n="1496" />
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;I .... committed sins of impurity, father.<lb n="1497" /></said> </p>
            <p> The priest did not turn his head. <lb n="1498" />
            <said who="Priest">&#8213;With yourself, my child?<lb n="1499" /> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;And ... with others.<lb n="1500" /> </said>
            <said who="Priest">&#8213;With women, my child?<lb n="1501" /> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;Yes, father.<lb n="1502" /> </said>
            <said who="Priest">Were they married women, my child?<lb n="1503" /></said> </p>
            <p>He did not know. His sins trickled from his lips, one by one, <lb n="1504" />
            trickled in shameful drops from his soul festering and oozing <lb n="1505" />
            like a sore, a squalid stream of vice. The last sins oozed forth, <lb n="1506" />
            sluggish, filthy. There was no more to tell. He bowed his head, <lb n="1507" />
            overcome.<lb n="1508" /> </p>
            <p> The priest was silent. Then he asked: <lb n="1509" />
            <said who="Priest">&#8213;How old are you, my child?<lb n="1510" /> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;Sixteen, father.<lb n="1511" /></said> </p>
            The priest passed his hand several times over his face. Then, <lb n="1512" />
            resting his forehead against his hand, he leaned towards the <lb n="1513" />
            grating and, with eyes still averted, spoke slowly. His voice was <lb n="1514" />
            weary and old. <lb n="1515" />
            <said who="Priest">&#8213;You are very young, my child, he said, and let me implore of <lb n="1516" />
            you to give up that sin. It is a terrible sin. It kills the body and <lb n="1517" />
            it kills the soul. It is the cause of many crimes and misfortunes. <lb n="1518" />
            Give it up, my child, for God' sake. It is dishonourable and <lb n="1519" />
            unmanly. You cannot know where that wretched habit will <lb n="1520" />
            lead you or where it will come against you. As long as you <lb n="1521" />
            commit that sin, my poor child, you will never be worth one <lb n="1522" />
            farthing to God. Pray to our mother Mary to help you. She will <lb n="1523" />
            help you, my child. Pray to Our Blessed Lady when that sin <lb n="1524" />
            comes into  your mind. I am sure you will do that, will you not? <lb n="1525" />
            You repent of all those sins. I am sure you do. And you will <lb n="1526" />
            promise God now that by His holy grace you will never offend <lb n="1527" />
            Him any more by that wicked sin. You will make that solemn <lb n="1528" />
            promise to God, will you not?<lb n="1529" /> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;Yes, father.<lb n="1530" /> </said>
            <p>The old and weary voice fell like sweet rain upon his quak- <lb n="1531" />
            ing parching heart. How sweet and sad! <lb n="1532" />
            <said who="Priest">&#8213;Do so, my poor child. The devil has  led you astray. Drive <lb n="1533" />
            him back to hell when he tempts you to dishonour your body <lb n="1534" />
            in that way - the foul spirit who hates Our Lord. Promise God <lb n="1535" />
            now that you will give up that sin, that wretched wretched sin.<lb n="1536" /></said> </p>
            <p>Blinded by his tears and by the light of God's mercifulness <lb n="1537" />
            he bent his head and heard the grave words of absolution <lb n="1538" />
            spoken and saw the priest's hand raised above him in token of <lb n="1539" />
            forgiveness. <lb n="1540" />
            <said who="Priest">&#8213;God bless you, my child. Pray for me.<lb n="1541" /></said> </p>
            <p>He knelt to say his penance, praying in a corner of the dark <lb n="1542" />
            nave: and his prayers ascended to heaven from his purified <lb n="1543" />
            heart like perfume streaming upwards from a heart of white <lb n="1544" />
            rose.<lb n="1545" /> </p>
            <p> The  muddy streets were gay. He strode homeward, con- <lb n="1546" />
            scious of an  invisible grace pervading and making light his <lb n="1547" />
            limbs. In spite of all he had done it. He had confessed and God <lb n="1548" />
            had pardoned him. His soul was made fair and holy once more, <lb n="1549" />
            holy and happy.<lb n="1550" /> </p>
            <p> It would be beautiful to die if God so willed. It was beautiful <lb n="1551" />
            to live if God so willed, to live in grace a life of peace and <lb n="1552" />
            virtue and forbearance with others.<lb n="1553" /> </p>
            <p> He sat by the fire in the kitchen, not daring to speak for <lb n="1554" />
            happiness. Till that moment he had not known how beautiful <lb n="1555" />
            and peaceful life could be. The green square of paper pinned <lb n="1556" />
            round the lamp cast down a tender shade. On the dresser was a <lb n="1557" />
            plate of sausages and white pudding and on the shelf there were <lb n="1558" />
            eggs. They would be for the breakfast in the morning after the <lb n="1559" />
            communion in the college chapel. White pudding and eggs and <lb n="1560" />
            sausages and cups of tea. How simple and beautiful was life <lb n="1561" />
            after all! And life lay all before him.<lb n="1562" /> </p>
            <p> In a dream he fell asleep. In a dream he rose and saw that it <lb n="1563" />
            was morning. In a waking dream he went through the quiet <lb n="1564" />
            morning towards the college.<lb n="1565" /> </p>
            <p> The boys were all there, kneeling in their places. He knelt <lb n="1566" />
            among them, happy and shy. The altar was heaped with fra- <lb n="1567" />
            grant masses of white flowers: and in the morning light the pale <lb n="1568" />
            flames of the candles among the white flowers were clear and <lb n="1569" />
            silent as his own soul.<lb n="1570" /> </p>
            <p> He knelt before the altar with his classmates, holding the <lb n="1571" />
            altar cloth with them over a living rail of hands. His hands <lb n="1572" />
            were trembling: and his soul trembled as he heard the priest <lb n="1573" />
            pass with the ciborium from communicant to communicant. <lb n="1574" />
            <said who="Priest">&#8213;<seg xml:lang="la">Corpus Domini nostri.</seg><lb n="1575" /></said> </p>
            <p> Could it be? He knelt there sinless and timid: and he would <lb n="1576" />
            hold upon his tongue the host and God would enter his purified <lb n="1577" />
            body. <lb n="1578" />
            <said who="Priest">&#8213;<seg xml:lang="la">In vitam eternam. Amen.</seg><lb n="1579" /></said> </p>
            <p> Another life! A life of grace and virtue and happiness! It was <lb n="1580" />
            true. It was not a dream from which he would wake.  The past <lb n="1581" />
            was past. <lb n="1582" />
            <said who="Priest">&#8213;<seg xml:lang="la">Corpus Domini nostri.</seg><lb n="1583" /></said> </p>
            <p> The ciborium had come to him.<lb n="1584" /> </p>

            <p> Sunday was dedicated to the mystery of the Holy Trinity, <lb n="1" />
            Monday to the Holy Ghost, Tuesday to the Guardian Angels, <lb n="2" />
            Wednesday to Saint Joseph, Thursday to the Most Blessed Sac- <lb n="3" />
            rament of the Altar, Friday to the Suffering Jesus, Saturday to <lb n="4" />
            the Blessed Virgin Mary.<lb n="5" /> </p>
            <p> Every morning he hallowed himself anew in the presence of <lb n="6" />
            some holy image or mystery. His day began with an heroic <lb n="7" />
            offering of its every moment of thought or action for the intentions <lb n="8" />
            tions of the sovereign pontiff and with an early mass. The raw <lb n="9" />
            morning air whetted his resolute piety; and often as he knelt <lb n="10" />
            among the few worshippers at the sidealtar, following with his <lb n="11" />
            interleaved prayerbook the murmur of the priest, he glanced up <lb n="12" />
            for an instant towards the vested figure standing in the gloom <lb n="13" />
            between the two candles which were the old and the new <lb n="14" />
            testaments and imagined that he was kneeling at mass in the <lb n="15" />
            catacombs.<lb n="16" /> </p>
            <p> His daily life was laid out in devotional areas. By means of <lb n="17" />
            ejaculations and prayers he stored up ungrudgingly for the <lb n="18" />
            souls in purgatory centuries of days and quarantines and years; <lb n="19" />
            yet the spiritual triumph which he felt in achieving with ease so <lb n="20" />
            many fabulous ages of canonical penances did not wholly re- <lb n="21" />
            ward his zeal of prayer since he could never know how much <lb n="22" />
            temporal punishment he had remitted by way of suffrage for <lb n="23" />
            the agonising souls: and, fearful lest in the midst of the purga- <lb n="24" />
            torial fire, which differed from the infernal only in that it was <lb n="25" />
            not everlasting, his penance might avail no more than a drop of <lb n="26" />
            moisture, he drove his soul daily through an increasing circle of <lb n="27" />
            works of supererogation.<lb n="28" /> </p>
            <p> Every part of his day, divided by what he regarded now as <lb n="29" />
            the duties of his station in life, circled about its own centre of <lb n="30" />
            spiritual energy. His life seemed to have drawn near to eternity; <lb n="31" />
            every thought, word and deed, every instance of consciousness <lb n="32" />
            could be made to revibrate radiantly in heaven: and at times his <lb n="33" />
            sense of such immediate repercussion was so lively that he <lb n="34" />
            seemed to feel his soul in devotion pressing like fingers the <lb n="35" />
            keyboard of a great cash register and to see the amount of his <lb n="36" />
            purchase start forth immediately in heaven, not as a number but <lb n="37" />
            as a frail column of incense or as a slender flower.<lb n="38" /> </p>
            <p> The rosaries too which he said constantly - for he carried his <lb n="39" />
            beads loose in his trousers' pockets that he might tell them as <lb n="40" />
            he walked the streets - transformed themselves into coronals of <lb n="41" />
            flowers of such vague unearthly texture that they seemed to <lb n="42" />
            him as hueless and odourless as they were nameless. He offered <lb n="43" />
            up each of his three daily chaplets that his soul might grow <lb n="44" />
            strong in each of the three theological virtues, in faith in the <lb n="45" />
            Father Who had created him, in hope in the Son Who had <lb n="46" />
            redeemed him, and in love of the Holy Ghost Who had sanc- <lb n="47" />
            tified him, and this thrice triple prayer he offered to the Three <lb n="48" />
            Persons through Mary in the name of her joyful and sorrowful <lb n="49" />
            and glorious  mysteries.<lb n="50" /> </p>
            <p> On each of the seven days of the week he further prayed that <lb n="51" />
            one of the seven gifts of the Holy Ghost might descend upon <lb n="52" />
            his soul and drive out of it day by day the seven deadly sins <lb n="53" />
            which had defiled it in the past; and he prayed for each gift on <lb n="54" />
            its appointed day, confident that it would descend upon him, <lb n="55" />
            though it seemed strange to him at times that wisdom and <lb n="56" />
            understanding and knowledge were so distinct in their nature <lb n="57" />
            that each should be prayed for apart from the others. Yet he <lb n="58" />
            believed that at some future stage of his spiritual progress this <lb n="59" />
            difficulty would be removed when his sinful soul had been <lb n="60" />
            raised up from its weakness and enlightened by the Third Person <lb n="61" />
            son of the Most Blessed Trinity. He believed this all the more, <lb n="62" />
            and with trepidation, because of the divine gloom and silence <lb n="63" />
            wherein dwelt the unseen Paraclete, Whose symbols were a <lb n="64" />
            dove and a mighty wind, to sin against Whom was a sin be- <lb n="65" />
            yond forgiveness, the eternal, mysterious secret Being to <lb n="66" />
            Whom, as God, the priests offered up mass once a year, robed <lb n="67" />
            in the scarlet of the tongues of fire.<lb n="68" /> </p>
            <p> The imagery through which the nature and kinship of the <lb n="69" />
            Three Persons of the Trinity were darkly shadowed forth in the <lb n="70" />
            books of devotion which he read - the Father contemplating <lb n="71" />
            from all eternity as in a mirror His Divine Perfections and <lb n="72" />
            thereby begetting eternally the Eternal Son and the Holy Spirit <lb n="73" />
            proceeding out of Father and Son from all eternity - were easier <lb n="74" />
            of acceptance by his mind by reason of their august incompre- <lb n="75" />
            hensibility than was the simple fact that God had loved his soul <lb n="76" />
            from all eternity, for ages before he had been born into the <lb n="77" />
            world, for ages before the world itself had existed. He had <lb n="78" />
            heard the names of the passions of love and hate pronounced <lb n="79" />
            solemnly on the stage and in the pulpit, had found them set <lb n="80" />
            forth solemnly in books, and had wondered why his soul was <lb n="81" />
            unable to harbour them for any time or to force his lips to utter <lb n="82" />
            their names with conviction. A brief anger had often invested <lb n="83" />
            him but he had never been able to make it an abiding passion <lb n="84" />
            and had always felt himself passing out of it as if his very body <lb n="85" />
            were being divested with ease of some outer skin or peel. He <lb n="86" />
            had felt a subtle, dark and murmurous presence penetrate his <lb n="87" />
            being and fire him with a brief iniquitous lust: it too had <lb n="88" />
            slipped beyond his grasp leaving his mind lucid and indifferent. <lb n="89" />
            This, it seemed, was the only love and that the only hate his <lb n="90" />
            soul would harbour.<lb n="91" /> </p>
            <p> But he could no longer disbelieve in the reality of love since <lb n="92" />
            God Himself had loved his individual soul with divine love <lb n="93" />
            from all eternity. Gradually, as his soul was enriched with <lb n="94" />
            spiritual knowledge, he saw the whole world forming one vast <lb n="95" />
            symmetrical expression of God's power and love. Life became a <lb n="96" />
            divine gift for every moment and sensation of which, were it <lb n="97" />
            even the sight of a single leaf hanging on the twig of a tree, his <lb n="98" />
            soul should praise and thank the Giver. The world for all its <lb n="99" />
            solid substance and complexity no longer existed for his soul <lb n="100" />
            save as a theorem of divine power and love and universality. So <lb n="101" />
            entire and unquestionable was this sense of the divine meaning <lb n="102" />
            in all nature granted to his soul that he could scarcely understand <lb n="103" />
            stand why it was in any way necessary that he should continue <lb n="104" />
            to live. Yet that was part of the divine purpose and he <lb n="105" />
            dared not question its use, he above all others who had sinned <lb n="106" />
            so deeply and so foully against the divine purpose. Meek and <lb n="107" />
            abased by this consciousness of the one eternal omnipresent <lb n="108" />
            perfect reality his soul took up again her burden of pieties, <lb n="109" />
            masses and prayers and sacraments and mortifications, and <lb n="110" />
            only then for the first time since he had brooded on the great <lb n="111" />
            mystery of love did he feel within him a warm movement like <lb n="112" />
            that of some newly born life or virtue of the soul itself. The <lb n="113" />
            attitude of rapture in sacred art, the raised and parted hands, <lb n="114" />
            the parted lips and eyes as of one about to swoon, became for <lb n="115" />
            him an image of the soul in prayer, humiliated and faint before <lb n="116" />
            her Creator.<lb n="117" /> </p>
            <p> But he had been forewarned of the dangers of spiritual exal- <lb n="118" />
            tation and did not allow himself to desist from even the least or <lb n="119" />
            lowliest devotion,  striving also by constant mortification to <lb n="120" />
            undo the sinful past rather than to achieve a saintliness fraught <lb n="121" />
            with peril. Each of his senses was brought under a rigorous <lb n="122" />
            discipline. In order to mortify the sense of sight he made it his <lb n="123" />
            rule to walk in the street with downcast eyes, glancing neither <lb n="124" />
            to right nor left and never behind him. His eyes shunned every <lb n="125" />
            encounter with the eyes of women. From time to time also he <lb n="126" />
            balked them by a sudden effort of the will, as by lifting them <lb n="127" />
            suddenly in the middle of an unfinished sentence and closing <lb n="128" />
            the book. To mortify his hearing he exerted no control over his <lb n="129" />
            voice which was then breaking, neither sang nor whistled and <lb n="130" />
            made no attempt to flee from noises which caused him painful <lb n="131" />
            nervous irritation such as the sharpening of knives on the <lb n="132" />
            knifeboard, the gathering of cinders on the fireshovel and the <lb n="133" />
            twigging of the carpet. To mortify his smell was more difficult <lb n="134" />
            as he found in himself no instinctive repugnance to bad odours, <lb n="135" />
            whether they were the odours of the outdoor world such as <lb n="136" />
            those of dung and tar or the odours of his own person among <lb n="137" />
            which he had made many curious comparisons and experiments. <lb n="138" />
            ments. He found in the end that the only odour against which <lb n="139" />
            his sense of smell revolted was a certain stale fishy stink like <lb n="140" />
            that of longstanding urine: and whenever it was possible he <lb n="141" />
            subjected himself to this unpleasant odour. To mortify the taste <lb n="142" />
            he practised strict habits at table, observed to the letter all the <lb n="143" />
            fasts of the church and sought by distraction to divert his mind <lb n="144" />
            from the savours of different foods. But it was to the mortification <lb n="145" />
            cation of touch that he brought the most assiduous ingenuity of <lb n="146" />
            inventiveness. He never consciously changed his position in <lb n="147" />
            bed, sat in the most uncomfortable positions, suffered patiently <lb n="148" />
            every itch and pain, kept away from the fire, remained on his <lb n="149" />
            knees all through the mass except at the gospels, left parts of <lb n="150" />
            his neck and face undried so that air might sting them and, <lb n="151" />
            whenever he was not saying his beads, carried his arms stiffly <lb n="152" />
            at his sides like a runner and never in his pockets or clasped <lb n="153" />
            behind him.<lb n="154" /> </p>
            <p> He had no temptations to sin mortally. It surprised him <lb n="155" />
            however to find that at the end of his course of intricate piety <lb n="156" />
            and selfrestraint he was so easily at the mercy of childish and <lb n="157" />
            unworthy imperfections. His prayers and fasts availed him little <lb n="158" />
            for the suppression of anger at hearing his mother sneeze or at <lb n="159" />
            being disturbed in his devotions. It needed an immense effort of <lb n="160" />
            his will to master the impulse which urged him to give outlet to <lb n="161" />
            such irritation. Images of the outbursts of trivial anger which <lb n="162" />
            he had often noted among his masters, their twitching mouths, <lb n="163" />
            closeshut lips and flushed cheeks, recurred to his memory, dis- <lb n="164" />
            couraging him, for all his practice of humility, by the comparison. <lb n="165" />
            son. To merge his life in the common tide of other lives was <lb n="166" />
            harder for him than any fasting or prayer, and it was his <lb n="167" />
            constant failure to do this to his own satisfaction which caused <lb n="168" />
            in his soul at last a sensation of spiritual dryness together with <lb n="169" />
            a growth of doubts and  scruples. His soul traversed a period of <lb n="170" />
            desolation in which the sacraments themselves seemed to have <lb n="171" />
            turned into dried up sources. His confession became a channel <lb n="172" />
            for the escape of scrupulous and unrepented imperfections. His <lb n="173" />
            actual reception of the eucharist did not bring him the same <lb n="174" />
            dissolving moments of virginal selfsurrender as did those spiritual <lb n="175" />
            tual communions made by him sometimes at the close of some <lb n="176" />
            visit to the Blessed Sacrament. The book which he used for <lb n="177" />
            these visits was an old neglected book written by saint Alphonsus <lb n="178" />
            sus Liguori, with fading characters and sere foxpapered leaves. <lb n="179" />
            A faded world of fervent love and virginal responses seemed to <lb n="180" />
            be evoked for his soul by the reading of its pages in which the <lb n="181" />
            imagery of the canticles was interwoven with the communicant's <lb n="182" />
            cant's prayers. An inaudible voice seemed to caress the soul, <lb n="183" />
            telling her names and glories, bidding her arise as for espousal <lb n="184" />
            and come away, bidding her look forth, a spouse, from Amana <lb n="185" />
            and from the mountains of the leopards; and the soul seemed to <lb n="186" />
            answer with the same inaudible voice, surrendering herself:<lb n="187" /> </p>
            <p> <seg xml:lang="la">Inter ubera mea commorabitur</seg>.<lb n="188" /> </p>
            <p> This idea of surrender had a perilous attraction for his mind <lb n="189" />
            now that he felt his soul beset once again by the insistent voices <lb n="190" />
            of the flesh which began to murmur to him again during his <lb n="191" />
            prayers and meditations. It gave him an intense sense of power <lb n="192" />
            to know that he  could by a single act of consent, in a moment <lb n="193" />
            of thought, undo all that he had done. He seemed to feel a <lb n="194" />
            flood slowly advancing towards his naked feet and to be waiting <lb n="195" />
            ing for the first faint timid noiseless wavelet to touch his <lb n="196" />
            fevered skin. Then, almost at the instant of that touch, almost <lb n="197" />
            at the verge of sinful consent, he found himself standing far <lb n="198" />
            away from the flood upon a dry shore, saved by a sudden act of <lb n="199" />
            the will or a sudden ejaculation: and, seeing the silver line of <lb n="200" />
            the flood far away and beginning again its slow advance to- <lb n="201" />
            wards his feet, a new thrill of power and satisfaction shook his <lb n="202" />
            soul to know that he had not yielded nor undone all.<lb n="203" /> </p>
            <p> When he had eluded the flood of temptation many times in <lb n="204" />
            this way he grew troubled and wondered whether the grace <lb n="205" />
            which he had refused to lose was not being filched from him <lb n="206" />
            little by little. The clear certitude of his own immunity grew <lb n="207" />
            dim and to it succeeded a vague fear that his soul had really <lb n="208" />
            fallen unawares. It was with difficulty that he won back his old <lb n="209" />
            consciousness of his state of grace by telling himself that he had <lb n="210" />
            prayed to God at every temptation and that the grace which he <lb n="211" />
            had prayed for must have been given to him inasmuch as God <lb n="212" />
            was obliged to give it. The very frequency and violence of <lb n="213" />
            temptations showed him at last the truth of what he had heard <lb n="214" />
            about the trials of the saints. Frequent and violent temptations <lb n="215" />
            were a proof that the citadel of the soul had not fallen and that <lb n="216" />
            the devil raged to make it fall.<lb n="217" /> </p>
            <p> Often when he had confessed his doubts and scruples, some <lb n="218" />
            momentary inattention at prayer, a movement of trivial anger <lb n="219" />
            in his soul or a subtle wilfulness in speech or act, he was bidden <lb n="220" />
            by his confessor to name some sin of his past life before absolution <lb n="221" />
            ution was given him. He named it with humility and shame and <lb n="222" />
            repented of it once more. It humiliated and shamed him to <lb n="223" />
            think that he would never be freed from it wholly, however <lb n="224" />
            holily he might live or whatever virtues or perfections he might <lb n="225" />
            attain. A restless feeling of guilt would always be present with <lb n="226" />
            him: he would confess and repent and be absolved, confess and <lb n="227" />
            repent again and be absolved again, fruitlessly. Perhaps that <lb n="228" />
            first hasty confession wrung from him by the fear of hell had <lb n="229" />
            not been good? Perhaps, concerned only for his imminent <lb n="230" />
            doom, he had not had sincere sorrow for his sin? But the surest <lb n="231" />
            sign that his confession had been good and that he had had <lb n="232" />
            sincere sorrow for his sin was, he knew, the amendment of his <lb n="233" />
            life. <lb n="234" />
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;I have amended  my life, have I not? he asked himself.<lb n="235" /></said> </p>

            <p> The director stood in the embrasure of the window, his back <lb n="236" />
            to the light, leaning an elbow on the brown crossblind and, as <lb n="237" />
            he spoke and smiled, slowly dangling and looping the cord of <lb n="238" />
            the other blind. Stephen stood before him, following for a mo- <lb n="239" />
            ment with his eyes the waning of the long summer daylight <lb n="240" />
            above the roofs or the slow deft movements of the priestly <lb n="241" />
            fingers. The priest's face was in total shadow but the waning <lb n="242" />
            daylight from behind him touched the deeply grooved temples <lb n="243" />
            and the curves of the skull. Stephen followed also with his ears <lb n="244" />
            the accents and intervals of the priest's voice as he spoke <lb n="245" />
            gravely and cordially of indifferent themes, the vacation which <lb n="246" />
            had just ended, the colleges of the order abroad, the transference <lb n="247" />
            ence of masters. The grave and cordial voice went on easily <lb n="248" />
            with its tale, and in the pauses Stephen felt bound to set it on <lb n="249" />
            again with respectful questions. He knew that the tale was a <lb n="250" />
            prelude and his mind waited for the sequel. Ever since the <lb n="251" />
            message of summons had come for him from the director his <lb n="252" />
            mind had struggled to find the meaning of the message; and <lb n="253" />
            during the long restless time he had sat in the college parlour <lb n="254" />
            waiting for the director to come in his eyes had wandered from <lb n="255" />
            one sober picture to another around the walls and his mind had <lb n="256" />
            wandered from one guess to another until the meaning of the <lb n="257" />
            summons had almost become clear. Then, just as he was wishing <lb n="258" />
            ing that some unforeseen cause might prevent the director from <lb n="259" />
            coming he had heard the handle of the door turning and the <lb n="260" />
            swish of a soutane.<lb n="261" /> </p>
            <p> The director had begun to speak of the dominican and fran- <lb n="262" />
            ciscan orders and of the friendship between saint Thomas and <lb n="263" />
            saint Bonaventure. The capuchin dress, he thought, was rather <lb n="264" />
            too .......<lb n="265" /> </p>
            <p> Stephen's face gave back the priest's indulgent smile and, not <lb n="266" />
            being anxious to give an opinion, he made a slight dubitative <lb n="267" />
            movement with his lips. <lb n="268" />
            <said who="the director">&#8213;I believe, continued the director, that there is some talk now <lb n="269" />
            among the capuchins themselves of doing away with it and <lb n="270" />
            following the example of the other franciscans.<lb n="271" /> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;I suppose they would retain it in the cloister, said Stephen.<lb n="272" /> </said>
            <said who="the director">&#8213;O certainly, said the director. For the cloister it is all right <lb n="273" />
            but for the street I really think it would be better to do away <lb n="274" />
            with it, don't you?<lb n="275" /> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;It must be troublesome, I imagine.<lb n="276" /> </said>
            <said who="Priest">&#8213;Of course it is, of course. Just imagine when I was in Bel- <lb n="277" />
            gium I used to see them out cycling in all kinds of weather with <lb n="278" />
            this thing up about their knees! It was really ridiculous. <seg xml:lang="fr">Les <lb n="279" />
            jupes</seg>, they call them in Belgium.<lb n="280" /></said> </p>
            <p> The vowel was so modified as to be indistinct. <lb n="281" />
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;What do they call them?<lb n="282" /> </said>
            <said who="Priest">&#8213;<seg xml:lang="fr">Les jupes.</seg><lb n="283" /> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">O.<lb n="284" /></said> </p>
            <p> Stephen smiled again in answer to the smile which he could <lb n="285" />
            not see on the priest's shadowed face, its image or spectre only <lb n="286" />
            passing rapidly across his mind as the low discreet accent fell <lb n="287" />
            upon his ear. He gazed calmly before him at the waning sky, <lb n="288" />
            glad of the cool of the evening and the faint yellow glow <lb n="289" />
            which hid the tiny flame kindling upon his cheek.<lb n="290" /> </p>
            <p> The names of articles of dress worn by women or of certain <lb n="291" />
            soft and delicate stuffs used in their making brought always to <lb n="292" />
            his mind a delicate and sinful perfume. As a boy he had imagined <lb n="293" />
            ined the reins by which horses are driven as slender silken <lb n="294" />
            bands and it shocked him to feel at <place><location><geo>53.293003 -6.168866</geo></location><placeName>Stradbrook</placeName></place> the greasy <lb n="295" />
            leather of harness. It had shocked him too when he had felt for <lb n="296" />
            the first time beneath his tremulous fingers the brittle texture of <lb n="297" />
            a woman's stocking for, retaining nothing of all he read save <lb n="298" />
            that which seemed to him an echo or a prophecy of his own <lb n="299" />
            state, it was only amid softworded phrases or within rosesoft <lb n="300" />
            stuffs that he dared to conceive of the soul or body of a woman <lb n="301" />
            moving with tender life.<lb n="302" /> </p>
            <p> But the phrase on the priest's lips was disingenuous for he <lb n="303" />
            knew that a priest should not speak lightly on that theme. The <lb n="304" />
            phrase had been spoken lightly with design and he felt that his <lb n="305" />
            face was being searched by the eyes in the shadow. Whatever <lb n="306" />
            he had heard or read of the craft of jesuits he had put aside <lb n="307" />
            frankly as not borne out by his own experience. His masters, <lb n="308" />
            even when they had not attracted him, had seemed to him <lb n="309" />
            always intelligent and serious priests, athletic and highspirited <lb n="310" />
            prefects. He thought of them as men who washed their bodies <lb n="311" />
            briskly with cold water and wore clean cold linen. During all <lb n="312" />
            the years he had lived among them in <place><location><geo>53.310601 -6.695541</geo></location><placeName>Clongowes</placeName></place> <lb n="313" />
            and in <place><location><geo>52.207800 -8.211070</geo></location><placeName>Bel-
            vedere</placeName></place> he had received only two pandies and, though these had <lb n="314" />
            been dealt him in the wrong, he knew that he had often escaped <lb n="315" />
            punishment. During all those years he had never heard from <lb n="316" />
            any of his masters a flippant word: it was they who had taught <lb n="317" />
            him christian doctrine and urged him to live a good life and, <lb n="318" />
            when he had fallen into grievous sin, it was they who had led <lb n="319" />
            him back to grace. Their presence had made him diffident of <lb n="320" />
            himself when he was a muff in Clongowes and it had made him <lb n="321" />
            diffident of himself also while he had held his equivocal <lb n="322" />
            position in Belvedere. A constant sense of this had remained <lb n="323" />
            with him up to the last year of his school life. He had never <lb n="324" />
            once disobeyed or allowed turbulent companions to seduce him <lb n="325" />
            from his habit of quiet obedience: and, even when he doubted <lb n="326" />
            some statement of a master, he had never presumed to doubt <lb n="327" />
            openly. Lately some of their judgments had sounded a little <lb n="328" />
            childish in his ears and had made him feel a regret and pity as <lb n="329" />
            though he were slowly passing out of an accustomed world and <lb n="330" />
            were hearing its language for the last time. One day when some <lb n="331" />
            boys had gathered round a priest under the shed near the <lb n="332" />
            chapel he had heard the priest say:<lb n="333" /> </p>
            <p> &#8213;I believe that Lord Macaulay was a man who probably never <lb n="334" />
            committed a mortal sin in his life, that is to say, a deliberate <lb n="335" />
            mortal sin.<lb n="336" /> </p>
            <p> Some of the boys had then asked the priest if Victor Hugo <lb n="337" />
            were not the greatest French writer. The priest had answered <lb n="338" />
            that Victor Hugo had never written half so well when he had <lb n="339" />
            turned against the church as he had written when he was a <lb n="340" />
            catholic. <lb n="341" />
            <said who="Priest">&#8213;But there are many eminent French critics, said the priest, <lb n="342" />
            who consider that even Victor Hugo, great as he certainly was, <lb n="343" />
            had not so pure a French style as Louis Veuillot.<lb n="344" /></said> </p>
            <p> The tiny flame which the priest's allusion had kindled upon <lb n="345" />
            Stephen's cheek had sunk down again and his eyes were still <lb n="346" />
            fixed calmly on the colorless sky. But an unresting doubt flew <lb n="347" />
            hither and thither before his mind. Masked memories passed <lb n="348" />
            quickly before him: he recognised scenes and persons yet he <lb n="349" />
            was conscious that he had failed to perceive some vital circumstance <lb n="350" />
            stance in them. He saw himself walking about the grounds <lb n="351" />
            watching the sports in <place><location><geo>53.348746 -6.275034</geo></location><placeName>Clongowes</placeName></place> and eating slim jim out of his <lb n="352" />
            cricketcap. Some jesuits were walking round the cycletrack in <lb n="353" />
            the company of ladies. The echoes of certain expressions used <lb n="354" />
            in <place><location><geo>53.348746 -6.275034</geo></location><placeName>Clongowes</placeName></place> sounded in remote caves of his mind.<lb n="355" /> </p>
            <p> His ears were listening to these distant echoes amid the si- <lb n="356" />
            lence of the parlour when he became aware that the priest was <lb n="357" />
            addressing him in a different voice.<lb n="358" /> </p>
            <p> &#8213;I sent for you today, Stephen, because I wished to speak to <lb n="359" />
            you on a very important subject.<lb n="360" /> </p>
            <p> &#8213;Yes, sir.<lb n="361" /> </p>
            <p> &#8213;Have you ever felt that you had a vocation?<lb n="362" /> </p>
            <p> Stephen parted his lips to answer yes and then withheld the <lb n="363" />
            word suddenly. The priest waited for the answer and added:<lb n="364" /> </p>
            <p> &#8213;I mean have you ever felt within yourself, in your soul, a <lb n="365" />
            desire to join the order. Think.<lb n="366" /> </p>
            <p> &#8213;I have sometimes thought of it, said Stephen.<lb n="367" /> </p>
            <p> The priest let the blindcord fall to one side and, uniting his <lb n="368" />
            hands, leaned his chin gravely upon them, communing with <lb n="369" />
            himself. <lb n="370" />
            <said who="Priest">&#8213;In a college like this, he said at length, there is one boy or <lb n="371" />
            perhaps two or three boys whom God calls to the religious life. <lb n="372" />
            Such a boy is marked off from his companions by his piety, by <lb n="373" />
            the good example he shows to others. He is looked up to by <lb n="374" />
            them; he is chosen perhaps as prefect by his fellow sodalists. <lb n="375" />
            And you, Stephen, have been such a boy in this college, prefect <lb n="376" />
            of Our Blessed Lady's sodality. Perhaps you are the boy in this <lb n="377" />
            college whom God designs to call to Himself.<lb n="378" /></said> </p>
            <p> A strong note of pride reinforcing the gravity of the priest's <lb n="379" />
            voice made Stephen's heart quicken in response.<lb n="380" /> </p>
            <p> &#8213;To receive that call, Stephen, said the priest, is the greatest <lb n="381" />
            honour that the Almighty God can bestow upon a man. No <lb n="382" />
            king or emperor on this earth has the power of the priest <lb n="383" />
            of God. No angel or archangel in heaven, no saint, not even <lb n="384" />
            the Blessed Virgin herself has the power of a priest of God: the <lb n="385" />
            power of the keys, the power to bind and to loose from sin, the <lb n="386" />
            power of exorcism, the power to cast out from the creatures of <lb n="387" />
            God the evil spirits that have power over them, the power, the <lb n="388" />
            authority, to make the great God of Heaven come down upon <lb n="389" />
            the altar and take the form of bread and wine. What an awful <lb n="390" />
            power, Stephen!<lb n="391" /> </p>
            <p> A flame began to flutter again on Stephen's cheek as he <lb n="392" />
            heard in this proud address an echo of his own proud musings. <lb n="393" />
            How often had he seen himself as a priest wielding calmly and <lb n="394" />
            humbly the awful power of which angels and saints stood in <lb n="395" />
            reverence! His soul had loved to muse in secret on this desire. <lb n="396" />
            He had seen himself, a young and silentmannered priest, en- <lb n="397" />
            tering a confessional swiftly, ascending the altarsteps, in- <lb n="398" />
            censing, genuflecting, accomplishing the vague acts of the <lb n="399" />
            priesthood which pleased him by reason of their semblance of <lb n="400" />
            reality and of their distance from it. In that dim life which he <lb n="401" />
            had lived through in his musings he had assumed the voices and <lb n="402" />
            gestures which he had noted with various priests. He had bent <lb n="403" />
            his knee sideways like such a one, he had shaken the thurible <lb n="404" />
            only slightly like such a one, his chasuble had swung open like <lb n="405" />
            that of such another as he had turned to the altar again after <lb n="406" />
            having blessed the people. And above all it had pleased him to <lb n="407" />
            fill the second place in those dim scenes of his imagining. He <lb n="408" />
            shrank from the dignity of celebrant because it displeased him <lb n="409" />
            to imagine that all the vague pomp should end in his own <lb n="410" />
            person or that the ritual should assign to him so clear and final <lb n="411" />
            an office. He longed for the minor sacred offices, to be vested <lb n="412" />
            with the tunicle of subdeacon at high mass, to stand aloof from <lb n="413" />
            the altar, forgotten by the people, his shoulders covered with a <lb n="414" />
            humeral veil, holding the paten within its folds, or, when the <lb n="415" />
            sacrifice had  been accomplished, to stand as deacon in a dal- <lb n="416" />
            matic of cloth of gold on the step below the celebrant, his <lb n="417" />
            hands joined and his face towards the people, and sing the <lb n="418" />
            chant <seg xml:lang="la">Ite, missa est</seg>. If ever he had seen himself celebrant it was <lb n="419" />
            as in the pictures of the mass in his child's massbook, in a <lb n="420" />
            church without worshippers, save for the angel of the sacrifice, <lb n="421" />
            at a bare altar and served by an acolyte scarcely more boyish <lb n="422" />
            than himself. In vague sacrificial or sacramental acts alone his <lb n="423" />
            will seemed drawn to go forth to encounter reality: and it was <lb n="424" />
            partly the absence of an appointed rite which had always con- <lb n="425" />
            strained him to inaction whether he had allowed silence to <lb n="426" />
            cover his anger or pride or had suffered only an embrace he <lb n="427" />
            longed to give.<lb n="428" /> </p>
            <p> He listened in reverent silence now to the priest's appeal and <lb n="429" />
            through the words he heard even more distinctly a voice bid- <lb n="430" />
            ding him approach, offering him secret knowledge and secret <lb n="431" />
            power. He would know then what was the sin  of Simon Magus <lb n="432" />
            and what the sin against the Holy Ghost for which there was <lb n="433" />
            no forgiveness. He would know obscure things, hidden from <lb n="434" />
            others, from those who  were conceived and born children of <lb n="435" />
            wrath. He would know the sins, the sinful longings and sinful <lb n="436" />
            thoughts and sinful acts, of others, hearing them murmured <lb n="437" />
            into his ears in the confessional under the shame of a darkened <lb n="438" />
            chapel by the lips of women and of girls: but rendered immune <lb n="439" />
            mysteriously at his ordination by the imposition of hands his <lb n="440" />
            soul would pass again uncontaminated to the white peace of <lb n="441" />
            the altar. No touch of sin would linger upon the hands with <lb n="442" />
            which he would elevate and break the host; no touch of sin <lb n="443" />
            would linger on his lips in prayer to make him eat and drink <lb n="444" />
            damnation to himself, not discerning the body of the Lord. He <lb n="445" />
            would hold his secret knowledge and secret power, being as <lb n="446" />
            sinless as the innocent: and he would be a priest for ever <lb n="447" />
            according to the order of Melchisedec.<lb n="448" /> </p>
            <p> &#8213;I will offer up my mass tomorrow morning, said the director, <lb n="449" />
            tor, that Almighty God may reveal to you His holy will. And <lb n="450" />
            let you, Stephen, make a novena to your holy patron saint, the first <lb n="451" />
            martyr, who is very powerful with God, that God may en- <lb n="452" />
            lighten your mind. But you must be quite sure, Stephen, that <lb n="453" />
            you have a vocation because it would be terrible if you found <lb n="454" />
            afterwards that you had none. Once a priest always a priest, <lb n="455" />
            remember. Your catechism tells you that the sacrament of Holy <lb n="456" />
            Orders is one of those which can be received only once because <lb n="457" />
            it imprints on the soul an indelible spiritual mark which can <lb n="458" />
            never be effaced. It is before you must weigh well, not after. It <lb n="459" />
            is a solemn question, Stephen, because on it may depend the <lb n="460" />
            salvation of your eternal soul. But we will pray to God to- <lb n="461" />
            gether.<lb n="462" /> </p>
            <p> He held open the heavy hall door and gave his hand as if <lb n="463" />
            already to a companion in the spiritual life. Stephen passed out <lb n="464" />
            on to  the wide platform above the steps and was conscious of <lb n="465" />
            the caress of mild evening air. Towards <place><location><geo>53.354445 -6.263812</geo></location><placeName>Findlater's church</placeName></place> a <lb n="466" />
            quartet of young men were striding along with linked arms, <lb n="467" />
            swaying their heads and stepping to the agile melody of their <lb n="468" />
            leader's concertina. The music passed in an instant, as the first <lb n="469" />
            bars of sudden music always did, over the fantastic fabrics of <lb n="470" />
            his mind, dissolving them painlessly and noiselessly as a sudden <lb n="471" />
            wave dissolves the sandbuilt turrets of children. Smiling at the <lb n="472" />
            trivial air he raised his eyes to the priest's face and, seeing in it <lb n="473" />
            a mirthless reflection of the sunken day, detached his hand <lb n="474" />
            slowly which had acquiesced  faintly in that companionship.<lb n="475" /> </p>
            <p> As he descended the steps the impression which effaced his <lb n="476" />
            troubled selfcommunion was that of a mirthless mask reflecting <lb n="477" />
            a sunken day from the threshold of the college. The shadow, <lb n="478" />
            then, of the life of the college passed gravely over his consciousness. <lb n="479" />
            ness. It was a grave and ordered and passionless life that <lb n="480" />
            awaited him, a life without material cares. He wondered how <lb n="481" />
            he would pass the first night in the novitiate and with what <lb n="482" />
            dismay he would wake the first morning in the dormitory. The <lb n="483" />
            troubling odour of the long corridors of <place><location><geo>53.348746 -6.275034</geo></location><placeName>Clongowes</placeName></place> came back <lb n="484" />
            to him and he heard the discreet murmur of the burning <lb n="485" />
            gasflames. At once from every part of his being unrest began to <lb n="486" />
            irradiate. A feverish quickening of his pulses followed and a din <lb n="487" />
            of meaningless words drove his reasoned thoughts hither and <lb n="488" />
            thither confusedly. His lungs dilated and sank as if he were <lb n="489" />
            inhaling a warm moist unsustaining air and he smelt again the <lb n="490" />
            warm moist air which hung in the bath in <place><location><geo>53.348746 -6.275034</geo></location><placeName>Clongowes</placeName></place> above the <lb n="491" />
            sluggish turfcoloured water.<lb n="492" /> </p>
            <p> Some instinct, waking at these memories, stronger than edu- <lb n="493" />
            cation or piety, quickened within him at every near approach <lb n="494" />
            to that life, an instinct subtle and hostile, and armed him <lb n="495" />
            against acquiescence. The chill and order of the life repelled <lb n="496" />
            him. He saw himself rising in the cold of the morning and filing <lb n="497" />
            down with the others to early mass and trying vainly to <lb n="498" />
            struggle with his prayers against the fainting sickness of his <lb n="499" />
            stomach. He saw himself sitting at dinner with the community <lb n="500" />
            of a college. What, then, had become of that deeprooted shyness of <lb n="501" />
            his which had made him loth to eat or drink under a strange <lb n="502" />
            roof? What had come of the pride of his spirit which had <lb n="503" />
            always made him conceive himself as a being apart in every <lb n="504" />
            order?<lb n="505" /> </p>
            <p> The Reverend Stephen Dedalus, S.J.<lb n="506" /> </p>
            <p> His name in that new life leaped into characters before his <lb n="507" />
            eyes and to it there followed a mental sensation of an unde- <lb n="508" />
            fined face or colour of a face. The colour faded and became <lb n="509" />
            strong like a changing glow of pallid brick red. Was it the raw <lb n="510" />
            reddish glow he had so often seen on wintry mornings on the <lb n="511" />
            shaven gills of the priests? The face was eyeless and sourfavoured <lb n="512" />
            voured and devout, shot with pink tinges of suffocated anger. <lb n="513" />
            Was it not a mental spectre of the face of one of the jesuits <lb n="514" />
            whom some of the boys called Lantern Jaws and others Foxy <lb n="515" />
            Campbell?<lb n="516" /> </p>
            <p> He was passing at that moment before the <place><location><geo>53.358000 -6.259655</geo></location><placeName>jesuit house in <lb n="517" />
            Gardiner Street</placeName></place>, and wondered vaguely which window would <lb n="518" />
            be his if he ever joined the order. Then he wondered at the <lb n="519" />
            vagueness of his wonder, at the remoteness of his soul <lb n="520" />
            from what he had hitherto imagined her sanctuary, at the frail <lb n="521" />
            hold which so many years of order and obedience had of him <lb n="522" />
            when once a definite and irrevocable act of his threatened to <lb n="523" />
            end for ever, in time and in eternity, his freedom. The voice of <lb n="524" />
            the director urging upon him the proud claims of the church <lb n="525" />
            and the mystery and power of the priestly office repeated itself <lb n="526" />
            idly in his memory. His soul was not there to hear and greet it <lb n="527" />
            and he knew now that the exhortation he had listened to had <lb n="528" />
            already fallen into an idle formal tale. He would never swing <lb n="529" />
            the thurible  before the tabernacle as priest. His destiny was to <lb n="530" />
            be elusive of social or religious orders. The wisdom of the <lb n="531" />
            priest's appeal did not touch him to the quick. He was destined <lb n="532" />
            to learn his own wisdom apart from others or to learn the <lb n="533" />
            wisdom of others himself wandering among the snares of the <lb n="534" />
            world.<lb n="535" /> </p>
            <p> The snares of the world were its ways of sin. He would fall. <lb n="536" />
            He had not yet fallen but he would fall silently, in an instant. <lb n="537" />
            Not to fall was too hard, too hard: and he felt the silent lapse <lb n="538" />
            of his soul, as it would be at some instant to come, falling, <lb n="539" />
            falling but not yet fallen, still unfallen but about to fall.<lb n="540" /> </p>
            <p> He crossed the bridge over the stream of the <place><location><geo> 53.361845 -6.242480</geo></location><placeName>Tolka</placeName></place> and <lb n="541" />
            turned his eyes coldly for an instant towards the faded blue <lb n="542" />
            shrine of the Blessed Virgin which stood fowlwise on a pole in <lb n="543" />
            the middle of a hamshaped encampment of poor cottages. <lb n="544" />
            Then, bending to the left, he followed the lane which led up to <lb n="545" />
            his house. The faint sour stink of rotted cabbages came to- <lb n="546" />
            wards him from the kitchengardens on the rising ground above <lb n="547" />
            the river. He smiled to think that it was this disorder, the <lb n="548" />
            misrule and confusion of his father's house and the stagnation <lb n="549" />
            of vegetable life, which was to win the day in his soul. Then a <lb n="550" />
            short laugh broke from his lips as he thought of that solitary <lb n="551" />
            farmhand in the kitchengardens behind their house whom they <lb n="552" />
            had nicknamed the man with the hat. A second laugh, taking <lb n="553" />
            rise from the first after a pause, broke from him involuntarily <lb n="554" />
            as he thought of how the man with the hat worked, considering <lb n="555" />
            in turn the four points of the sky and then regretfully plunging <lb n="556" />
            his spade in the earth.<lb n="557" /> </p>
            <p> He pushed open the latchless door of the porch and passed <lb n="558" />
            through the naked hallway into the kitchen. A group of his <lb n="559" />
            brothers and sisters was sitting round the table. Tea was nearly <lb n="560" />
            over and only the last of the second watered tea remained in <lb n="561" />
            the bottoms of the small glassjars and jampots which did ser- <lb n="562" />
            vice for teacups. Discarded crusts and lumps of sugared bread, <lb n="563" />
            turned brown by the tea which had been poured over them, lay <lb n="564" />
            scattered on the table. Little wells of tea lay here and there on <lb n="565" />
            the board and a knife with a broken ivory handle was stuck <lb n="566" />
            through the pith of a ravaged turnover.<lb n="567" /> </p>
            <p> The sad quiet greyblue glow of the dying day came through <lb n="568" />
            the window and the open door, covering over and allaying <lb n="569" />
            quietly a sudden instinct of remorse in Stephen's heart. All that <lb n="570" />
            had been denied them had been freely given to him, the eldest: <lb n="571" />
            but the quiet glow of evening showed him in their faces no sign <lb n="572" />
            of rancour.<lb n="573" /> </p>
            <p> He sat near them at the table and asked where his father and <lb n="574" />
            mother were. One answered:<lb n="575" /> </p>
            <p> &#8213;Goneboro toboro lookboro atboro aboro houseboro.<lb n="576" /> </p>
            <p> Still another removal! A boy named Fallon in Belvedere had <lb n="577" />
            often asked him with a silly laugh why they moved so often. A <lb n="578" />
            frown of scorn darkened quickly his forehead as he heard again <lb n="579" />
            the silly laugh of the questioner.<lb n="580" /> </p>
            <p> He asked:<lb n="581" /> </p>
            <p> &#8213;Why are we on the move again, if it's a fair question?<lb n="582" /> </p>
            <p> The same sister answered:<lb n="583" /> </p>
            <p> &#8213;Becauseboro theboro landboro lordboro willboro putboro <lb n="584" />
            usboro outboro.<lb n="585" /> </p>
            <p> The voice of his youngest brother from the farther side of <lb n="586" />
            the fireplace began to sing the air <emph>Oft in the Stilly Night</emph>. One <lb n="587" />
            by one the others took up the air until a full choir of voices was <lb n="588" />
            singing. They would sing so for hours, melody after melody, <lb n="589" />
            glee after glee, till the last pale light died down on the horizon, <lb n="590" />
            till the first dark nightclouds came forth and night fell.<lb n="591" /> </p>
            <p> He waited for some moments, listening, before he too took <lb n="592" />
            up the air with them. He was listening with pain of spirit to the <lb n="593" />
            overtone of weariness behind their frail fresh innocent voices. <lb n="594" />
            Even before they set out on life's journey they seemed weary <lb n="595" />
            already of the way.<lb n="596" /> </p>
            <p> He heard the choir of voices in the kitchen echoed and mul- <lb n="597" />
            tiplied through an endless reverberation of the choirs of endless <lb n="598" />
            generations of children: and heard in all the echoes an echo also <lb n="599" />
            of the recurring note of weariness and pain. All seemed weary <lb n="600" />
            of life even before entering upon it. And he remembered that <lb n="601" />
            Newman had heard this note also in the broken lines of Virgil <lb n="602" />
            <emph>giving utterance, like the voice of Nature herself, to that pain <lb n="603" />
            and weariness yet hope of better things which has been the <lb n="604" />
            experience of her children in every time.</emph><lb n="605" /> </p>

            <p> From the door of Byron's publichouse to the gate of Clontarf <lb n="607" />
            tarf Chapel, from the gate of <place><location><geo>53.364179 -6.201478</geo></location><placeName>Clontarf Chapel</placeName></place> to the door of <lb n="608" />
            Byron's publichouse and then back again to the chapel and <lb n="609" />
            then back again to the publichouse he had paced slowly at first, <lb n="610" />
            planting his steps scrupulously in the spaces of the patchwork <lb n="611" />
            of the footpath, then timing their fall to the fall of verses. A full <lb n="612" />
            hour had passed since his father had gone in with Dan Crosby, <lb n="613" />
            the tutor, to find out for him something about the <place><location><geo>53.310485 -6.225058</geo></location><placeName>university</placeName></place>. <lb n="614" />
            For a full hour he had paced up and down, waiting: but he <lb n="615" />
            could wait no longer.<lb n="616" /> </p>
            <p> He set off abruptly for <place><location><geo>53.359381 -6.179831</geo></location><placeName>the Bull</placeName></place>, walking rapidly lest his <lb n="617" />
            father's shrill whistle might call him back; and in a few mo- <lb n="618" />
            ments he had rounded the curve at the police barrack and was <lb n="619" />
            safe.<lb n="620" /> </p>
            <p> Yes, his mother was hostile to the idea, as he  had read from <lb n="621" />
            her listless silence. Yet her mistrust pricked him more keenly <lb n="622" />
            than his father's pride and he thought coldly how he had <lb n="623" />
            watched the faith which was fading down in his soul aging and <lb n="624" />
            strengthening in her eyes. A dim antagonism gathered force <lb n="625" />
            within him and darkened his mind as a cloud against her dis- <lb n="626" />
            loyalty: and when it  passed, cloudlike, leaving his mind serene <lb n="627" />
            and dutiful towards her again, he was made aware dimly and <lb n="628" />
            without regret of a first noiseless sundering of their lives.<lb n="629" /> </p>
            <p> The university! So he had passed beyond the challenge of the <lb n="630" />
            sentries who had stood as guardians of his boyhood and had <lb n="631" />
            sought to keep him among them that he might be subject to <lb n="632" />
            them and serve their ends. Pride after satisfaction uplifted him <lb n="633" />
            like long slow waves. The end he had been born to serve yet <lb n="634" />
            did not see had led him to escape by an unseen path: and now it <lb n="635" />
            beckoned to him once more and a new adventure was about to <lb n="636" />
            be opened to him. It seemed to him that he heard notes of fitful <lb n="637" />
            music leaping upwards a tone and downwards a diminished <lb n="638" />
            fourth, upwards a tone and downwards a major third, like <lb n="639" />
            triplebranching flames leaping fitfully, flame after flame, out of <lb n="640" />
            a midnight wood. It was an elfin prelude, endless and formless; <lb n="641" />
            and, as it grew wilder and faster, the flames leaping out of <lb n="642" />
            time, he seemed to hear from under the boughs and grasses <lb n="643" />
            wild creatures racing, their feet pattering like rain upon the <lb n="644" />
            leaves. Their feet passed in pattering tumult over his mind, the <lb n="645" />
            feet of hares and rabbits, the feet of harts and hinds and ante- <lb n="646" />
            lopes, until he heard them no more and remembered only a <lb n="647" />
            proud cadence from Newman: <emph>Whose feet are as the feet of <lb n="648" />
            harts and underneath the everlasting arms.</emph><lb n="649" /> </p>
            <p> The pride of that dim image brought back to his mind the <lb n="650" />
            dignity of the office he had refused. All through his boyhood he <lb n="651" />
            had mused upon that which he had so often thought to be his <lb n="652" />
            destiny and when the moment had come for him to obey the <lb n="653" />
            call he had turned aside, obeying a wayward instinct. Now <lb n="654" />
            time lay between: the oils of ordination would never anoint his <lb n="655" />
            body. He had refused. Why?<lb n="656" /> </p>
            <p> He turned seaward  from the road at <place><location><geo>53.365979 -6.174239</geo></location><placeName>Dollymount</placeName></place> and as he <lb n="657" />
            passed on to the thin wooden bridge he felt the planks shaking <lb n="658" />
            with the tramp of heavily shod feet. A squad of christian <lb n="659" />
            brothers was on its way back from the <place><location><geo>53.369769 -6.147334</geo></location><placeName>Bull</placeName></place> and had begun to <lb n="660" />
            pass, two by two, across the bridge. Soon the whole bridge was <lb n="661" />
            trembling and resounding. The uncouth faces passed him two <lb n="662" />
            by two, stained yellow or red or livid by the sea, and as he <lb n="663" />
            strove to look at them with ease and indifference, a faint stain <lb n="664" />
            of personal shame and commiseration rose to his own face. <lb n="665" />
            Angry with himself he tried to hide his face from their eyes by <lb n="666" />
            gazing down sideways into the shallow swirling water under <lb n="667" />
            the bridge but he still saw a reflection therein of their topheavy <lb n="668" />
            silk hats, and humble tapelike collars and loosely hanging cleri- <lb n="669" />
            cal clothes. <lb n="670" />
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;Brother Hickey. <lb n="671" />
            Brother Quaid. <lb n="672" />
            Brother MacArdle. <lb n="673" />
            Brother Keogh.<lb n="674" /></said> </p>
            <p> Their piety would be like their names, like their faces, like <lb n="675" />
            their clothes, and it was idle for him to tell himself that their <lb n="676" />
            humble and contrite hearts, it might be, paid a far richer tribute <lb n="677" />
            of devotion than his had ever been, a gift tenfold more acceptable <lb n="678" />
            able than his elaborate adoration. It was idle for him to move <lb n="679" />
            himself to be generous towards them, to tell himself that if he <lb n="680" />
            ever came to their gates, stripped of his pride, beaten and in <lb n="681" />
            beggar's weeds, that they would be generous towards him, <lb n="682" />
            loving him as themselves. Idle and embittering, finally,  to ar- <lb n="683" />
            gue, against his own dispassionate certitude, that the com- <lb n="684" />
            mandment of love bade us not to love our neighbour  as <lb n="685" />
            ourselves with the same amount and intensity of love but to <lb n="686" />
            love him as ourselves with the same kind of love.<lb n="687" /> </p>
            <p> He drew forth a phrase from his treasure and spoke it softly <lb n="688" />
            to himself:<lb n="689" /> </p>
            <p> &#8213;A day of dappled seaborne clouds.<lb n="690" /> </p>
            <p> The phrase and the day and the scene harmonised in a <lb n="691" />
            chord. Words. Was it their colours? He allowed them to glow <lb n="692" />
            and fade, hue after hue: sunrise gold, the russet and green of <lb n="693" />
            apple orchards, azure of waves, the greyfringed fleece of <lb n="694" />
            clouds. No, it was not their colours: it was the poise and <lb n="695" />
            balance of the period itself. Did he then love the rhythmic rise <lb n="696" />
            and fall of words better than their associations of legend and <lb n="697" />
            colour? Or was it that, being as weak of sight as he was shy of <lb n="698" />
            mind, he drew less pleasure from the reflection of the glowing <lb n="699" />
            sensible world through the prism of a language manycoloured <lb n="700" />
            and richly storied than from the contemplation of an inner <lb n="701" />
            world of individual emotions mirrored perfectly in a lucid <lb n="702" />
            supple periodic prose?<lb n="703" /> </p>
            <p> He passed from the trembling bridge on to firm land again. <lb n="704" />
            At that instant, as it seemed to him, the air was chilled and <lb n="705" />
            looking askance towards the water he saw a flying squall dark- <lb n="706" />
            ening and crisping suddenly the tide. A faint click at his heart, a <lb n="707" />
            faint throb in his throat told him once more of how his flesh <lb n="708" />
            dreaded the cold infrahuman odour of the sea: yet he did not <lb n="709" />
            strike across the downs on his left but held straight on along <lb n="710" />
            the spine of rocks that pointed against the river's mouth.<lb n="711" /> </p>
            <p> A veiled sunlight lit up faintly the grey sheet of water where <lb n="712" />
            the river was embayed. In the distance along the course of the <lb n="713" />
            slowflowing Liffey slender masts flecked the sky and, more <lb n="714" />
            distant still, the dim fabric of the city lay prone in haze. Like a <lb n="715" />
            scene on some vague arras, old as man's weariness, the image <lb n="716" />
            of the seventh city of christendom was visible to him across the <lb n="717" />
            timeless air, no older nor more weary nor less patient of subjection <lb n="718" />
            tion than in the days of the thingmote.<lb n="719" /> </p>
            <p> Disheartened, he raised his eyes towards the slowdrifting <lb n="720" />
            clouds, dappled and seaborne. They were voyaging across the <lb n="721" />
            deserts of the sky, a host of nomads on the march, voyaging <lb n="722" />
            high over Ireland, westward bound. The Europe they had come <lb n="723" />
            from lay out there beyond the <place><location><geo>53.13 -5.32</geo></location><placeName>Irish Sea</placeName></place>, Europe of strange <lb n="724" />
            tongues and valleyed and woodbegirt and citadelled and of <lb n="725" />
            entrenched and marshalled races. He heard a confused music <lb n="726" />
            within him as of memories and names which he was almost <lb n="727" />
            conscious of but could not capture even for an instant; then the <lb n="728" />
            music seemed to recede, to  recede, to recede: and from each <lb n="729" />
            receding trail of nebulous music there fell always one long- <lb n="730" />
            drawn calling note, piercing like a star the dusk of silence. <lb n="731" />
            Again! Again! Again! Again! A voice from beyond the world <lb n="732" />
            was calling. <lb n="733" />
            <said who="a voice">&#8213;Hello, Stephanos!<lb n="734" /> </said>
            <said who="a voice">&#8213;Here comes The Dedalus!<lb n="735" /> </said>
            <said who="a voice">&#8213;Ao! ... Eh, give it over, Dwyer, I'm telling you or I'll give you <lb n="736" />
            a stuff in the kisser for yourself .... Ao!<lb n="737" /> </said>
            <said who="a voice">&#8213;Good man, Towser! Duck him!<lb n="738" /> </said>
            <said who="a voice">&#8213;Come along, Dedalus! Bous Stephanoumenos! Bous Steph- <lb n="739" />
            aneforos!<lb n="740" /> </said>
            <said who="a voice">&#8213;Duck him! Guzzle him now, Towser!<lb n="741" /> </said>
            <said who="a voice">&#8213;Help! Help! ... Ao!<lb n="742" /></said> </p>
            <p> He recognised their speech collectively before he distin- <lb n="743" />
            guished their faces. The mere sight of that medley of wet <lb n="744" />
            nakedness chilled him to the bone. Their bodies, corpsewhite <lb n="745" />
            or suffused with a pallid golden light or rawly tanned by the <lb n="746" />
            sun, gleamed with the wet of the sea. Their divingstone, poised <lb n="747" />
            on its rude supports and rocking under their plunges, and the <lb n="748" />
            roughhewn stones of the sloping breakwater over which they <lb n="749" />
            scrambled in their horseplay, gleamed with cold wet lustre. The <lb n="750" />
            towels with which they smacked their bodies were heavy with <lb n="751" />
            cold seawater: and drenched with cold brine was their matted <lb n="752" />
            hair.<lb n="753" /> </p>
            <p> He stood still in deference to their calls and parried their <lb n="754" />
            banter with easy words. How characterless they looked: Shuley <lb n="755" />
            without his deep unbuttoned collar, Ennis without his scarlet <lb n="756" />
            belt with the snaky clasp, and Connolly  without his <place><location><geo>52.613969 0.886402</geo></location><placeName>Norfolk</placeName></place> <lb n="757" />
            coat with the flapless sidepockets!  It was a pain to see them and <lb n="758" />
            a swordlike pain to see the signs of adolescence that made <lb n="759" />
            repellent their pitiable nakedness. Perhaps they had taken refuge <lb n="760" />
            uge in number and noise from the secret dread in their souls. <lb n="761" />
            But he, apart from them and in silence, remembered in what <lb n="762" />
            dread he stood of the mystery of his own body.<lb n="763" /> </p>
            <p> &#8213;Stephanos Dedalos! Bous Stephanoumenos! Bous Stephane- <lb n="764" />
            foros!<lb n="765" /> </p>
            <p> Their banter was not new to him and now it <lb n="766" />
            flattered his mild proud sovereignty. Now, as never before, his <lb n="767" />
            strange name seemed to him a prophecy. So timeless seemed <lb n="768" />
            the grey warm air, so fluid and impersonal his own mood, that <lb n="769" />
            all ages were as one to him. A moment before the ghost of <lb n="770" />
            the ancient kingdom of the Danes had looked forth through the <lb n="771" />
            vesture of the hazewrapped city. Now, at the name of the <lb n="772" />
            fabulous artificer, he seemed to hear the noise of dim waves <lb n="773" />
            and to see a winged form flying above the waves and slowly <lb n="774" />
            climbing the air. What did it mean? Was it a quaint device <lb n="775" />
            opening a page of some medieval book of prophecies and sym- <lb n="776" />
            bols, a hawklike man flying sunward above the sea, a prophecy <lb n="777" />
            of the end he had been born to serve and had been following <lb n="778" />
            through the mists of childhood and boyhood, a symbol of the <lb n="779" />
            artist forging anew in his workshop out of the sluggish matter <lb n="780" />
            of the earth a new soaring impalpable imperishable being?<lb n="781" /> </p>
            <p> His heart trembled;  his breath came faster and a wild spirit <lb n="782" />
            passed over his limbs as though he were soaring sunward. His <lb n="783" />
            heart trembled in an ecstasy of fear and his soul was in flight. <lb n="784" />
            His soul was soaring in an air beyond the world and the body <lb n="785" />
            he knew was purified in a breath and delivered of incertitude <lb n="786" />
            and made radiant and commingled with the element of the <lb n="787" />
            spirit. An ecstasy of flight made radiant his eyes and wild his <lb n="788" />
            breath and tremulous and wild and radiant his windswept <lb n="789" />
            limbs. <lb n="790" />
            <said who="a voice">&#8213;One! Two! ... Look out!<lb n="790" /> </said>
            <said who="a voice">&#8213;O, cripes, I'm drownded!<lb n="792" /> </said>
            <said who="a voice">&#8213;One! Two! Three and away!<lb n="793" /> </said>
            <said who="a voice">&#8213;Me next! Me next!<lb n="794" /> </said>
            <said who="a voice">&#8213;One! ... Uk!<lb n="795" /> </said>
            <said who="a voice">&#8213;Stephaneforos!<lb n="796" /></said> </p>
            <p> His throat ached with a desire to cry aloud, the cry of a <lb n="797" />
            hawk or eagle on high, to cry piercingly of his deliverance to <lb n="798" />
            the winds. This was the call of life to his soul not the dull gross <lb n="799" />
            voice of the world of duties and despair, not the inhuman voice <lb n="800" />
            that had called him to the pale service of the altar. An instant <lb n="801" />
            of wild flight had delivered him and the cry of triumph which <lb n="802" />
            his lips withheld cleft his brain. <lb n="803" />
            <said who="a voice">&#8213;Stephaneforos!<lb n="804" /></said> </p>
            <p> What were they now but cerements shaken from the body of <lb n="805" />
            death death - the fear he had walked in night and day, the incertitude <lb n="806" />
            that had ringed him round, the shame that had abased him <lb n="807" />
            within and without - cerements, the linens of the grave?<lb n="808" /> </p>
            <p> His soul had arisen from the grave of boyhood, spurning her <lb n="809" />
            graveclothes. Yes! Yes! Yes! He would create proudly out of the <lb n="810" />
            freedom and power of his soul, as the great artificer whose <lb n="811" />
            name he bore, a living thing, new and soaring and beautiful, <lb n="812" />
            impalpable, imperishable.<lb n="813" /> </p>
            <p> He started up nervously from the stoneblock for he could no <lb n="814" />
            longer quench the flame in his blood. He felt his cheeks aflame <lb n="815" />
            and his throat throbbing with song. There was a lust of wan- <lb n="816" />
            dering in his feet that burned to set out for the ends of the <lb n="817" />
            earth. On! On! his heart seemed to cry. Evening would deepen <lb n="818" />
            above the sea, night fall upon the plains, dawn glimmer before <lb n="819" />
            the wanderer and show him strange fields and hills and faces. <lb n="820" />
            Where?<lb n="821" /> </p>
            <p> He looked northward towards <place><location><geo>53.378569 -6.057013</geo></location><placeName>Howth</placeName></place>. The sea had fallen <lb n="822" />
            below the line of seawrack on the shallow side of the breakwater <lb n="823" />
            water and already the tide was running out fast along the <lb n="824" />
            foreshore. Already one long oval bank of sand lay warm and <lb n="825" />
            dry amid the wavelets. Here and there warm isles of sand <lb n="826" />
            gleamed above the shallow tide, and about the isles and around <lb n="827" />
            the long bank and amid the shallow currents of the beach were <lb n="828" />
            lightclad gayclad figures, wading and delving.<lb n="829" /> </p>
            <p> In a few moments he was barefoot, his stockings folded in <lb n="830" />
            his pockets and his canvas shoes dangling by their knotted laces <lb n="831" />
            over his shoulders: and, picking a pointed salteaten stick out of <lb n="832" />
            the jetsam among the rocks, he clambered down the slope of <lb n="833" />
            the breakwater.<lb n="834" /> </p>
            <p> There was a long rivulet in the <place><location><geo>53.366498 -6.147804</geo></location><placeName>strand</placeName></place>: and, as he waded <lb n="835" />
            slowly up its course, he wondered at the endless drift of sea- <lb n="836" />
            weed. Emerald and black and russet and olive, it moved <lb n="837" />
            beneath the current, swaying and turning. The water of the <lb n="838" />
            rivulet was dark with endless drift and mirrored the highdrifting <lb n="839" />
            ing clouds. The clouds were drifting above him silently and <lb n="840" />
            silently the seatangle was drifting below him; and the grey <lb n="841" />
            warm air was still: and a new wild life was singing in his veins.<lb n="842" /> </p>
            <p> Where was his boyhood now? Where was the soul that had <lb n="843" />
            hung back from her destiny, to brood alone upon the shame of <lb n="844" />
            her wounds and in her house of squalor and subterfuge to <lb n="845" />
            queen it in faded cerements and in wreaths that withered at the <lb n="846" />
            touch? Or where was he?<lb n="847" /> </p>
            <p> He was alone. He was unheeded, happy and near to the wild <lb n="848" />
            heart of life. He was alone and young and wilful and wild- <lb n="849" />
            hearted, alone amid a waste of wild air and brackish waters <lb n="850" />
            and the seaharvest of shells and tangle and veiled grey sunlight <lb n="851" />
            and gayclad lightclad figures, of children and girls and voices <lb n="852" />
            childish and girlish in the air.<lb n="853" /> </p>
            <p> A girl stood before him in midstream, alone and still, gazing <lb n="854" />
            out to sea. She seemed like one whom magic had changed into <lb n="855" />
            the likeness of a strange and beautiful seabird. Her long slender <lb n="856" />
            bare legs were delicate as a crane's and pure save where an <lb n="857" />
            emerald trail of seaweed had fashioned itself as a sign upon the <lb n="858" />
            flesh. Her thighs, fuller and softhued as ivory, were bared al- <lb n="859" />
            most to the hips where the white fringes of her drawers were <lb n="860" />
            like featherings of soft white down. Her slateblue skirts were <lb n="861" />
            kilted boldly about her waist and dovetailed behind her. Her <lb n="862" />
            bosom was as  a bird's soft and slight, slight and soft as the <lb n="863" />
            breast of some darkplumaged dove. But her long fair hair was <lb n="864" />
            girlish; and girlish, and touched with the wonder of mortal <lb n="865" />
            beauty, her face.<lb n="866" /> </p>
            <p> She was alone and still, gazing out to sea; and when she felt <lb n="867" />
            his presence and the worship of his eyes her eyes turned to him <lb n="868" />
            in quiet sufferance of his gaze, without shame or wantonness. <lb n="869" />
            Long, long she suffered his gaze and then quietly withdrew her <lb n="870" />
            eyes from his and bent them towards the stream, gently stirring <lb n="871" />
            the water with her foot hither and thither. The first faint noise <lb n="872" />
            of gently moving water broke the silence, low and faint and <lb n="873" />
            whispering, faint as the bells of sleep; hither and thither, hither <lb n="874" />
            and thither: and a faint flame trembled on her cheek.<lb n="875" /> </p>
            <p> &#8213;Heavenly God! cried Stephen's soul, in an outburst of pro- <lb n="876" />
            fane joy.<lb n="877" /> </p>
            <p> He turned away from her suddenly and set off across the <place><location><geo>53.366498 -6.147804</geo></location><placeName> <lb n="878" />
            strand</placeName></place>. His cheeks  were aflame; his body was aglow; his limbs <lb n="879" />
            were trembling. On and on and on and on he strode, far out <lb n="880" />
            over the sands, singing wildly to the sea, crying to greet the <lb n="881" />
            advent of the life that had cried to him.<lb n="882" /> </p>
            <p> Her image had passed into his soul for ever and no word had <lb n="883" />
            broken the holy silence of his ecstasy. Her eyes had called him <lb n="884" />
            and his soul had leaped at the call. To live, to err, to fall, to <lb n="885" />
            triumph, to recreate life out of life! A wild angel had appeared <lb n="886" />
            to him, the angel of mortal youth and beauty, an envoy from <lb n="887" />
            the fair courts of life, to throw open before him in an instant of <lb n="888" />
            ecstasy the gates of all the ways of error and glory. On and on <lb n="889" />
            and on and on!<lb n="890" /> </p>
            <p> He halted suddenly and heard his heart in the silence. How <lb n="891" />
            far had he walked? What hour was it?<lb n="892" /> </p>
            <p> There was no human figure near him nor any sound borne <lb n="893" />
            to him over the air. But the tide was near the turn and already <lb n="894" />
            the day was on the wane. He turned landward and ran towards <lb n="895" />
            the shore and, running up the sloping beach, reckless of the <lb n="896" />
            sharp shingle, found a sandy nook amid a ring of tufted sand- <lb n="897" />
            knolls and lay down there that the peace and silence of the <lb n="898" />
            evening might still the riot of his blood.<lb n="899" /> </p>
            <p> He  felt above him the vast indifferent dome and the calm <lb n="900" />
            processes of the heavenly bodies; and the earth beneath him, <lb n="901" />
            the earth that had borne him, had taken him to her breast.<lb n="902" /> </p>
            <p> He closed his eyes in the languor of sleep. His eyelids <lb n="903" />
            trembled as if they felt the vast cyclic movement of the earth <lb n="904" />
            and her watchers, trembled as if they felt the strange light of <lb n="905" />
            some new world. His soul was swooning into some new world, <lb n="906" />
            fantastic, dim, uncertain as under sea, traversed by cloudy <lb n="907" />
            shapes and beings. A world, a glimmer, or a flower? Glimmering <lb n="908" />
            ing and trembling, trembling and unfolding, a breaking light, <lb n="909" />
            an opening flower, it spread in endless succession to itself, <lb n="910" />
            breaking in full crimson and unfolding and fading to palest <lb n="911" />
            rose, leaf by leaf and wave of light by wave of light, flooding all <lb n="912" />
            the heavens with its soft flushes, every flush deeper than other.<lb n="913" /> </p>
            <p> Evening had fallen when he woke and the sand and arid <lb n="914" />
            grasses of his bed glowed no longer. He rose slowly and, re- <lb n="915" />
            calling the rapture of his sleep, sighed at its joy.<lb n="916" /> </p>
            <p> He climbed to the crest of the sandhill and gazed about him. <lb n="917" />
            Evening had fallen. A rim of the young moon cleft the pale <lb n="918" />
            waste of sky like the rim of a silver hoop embedded in grey <lb n="919" />
            sand: and the tide was flowing in fast to the land with a low <lb n="920" />
            whisper of her waves, islanding a few last figures in distant <lb n="921" />
            pools.<lb n="922" /> </p>

            <p> He drained his third cup of watery tea to the dregs and set to <lb n="1" />
            chewing the crusts of fried bread that were scattered near him, <lb n="2" />
            staring into the dark pool of the jar. The yellow dripping had <lb n="3" />
            been scooped out like a boghole and the pool under it brought <lb n="4" />
            back to his memory the dark turfcoloured water of the bath in <place><location><geo>53.310601 -6.695541</geo></location> <lb n="5" />
            <placeName>Clongowes</placeName></place>. The box of pawntickets at his elbow had just been <lb n="6" />
            rifled and he took up idly one after another in his greasy fingers <lb n="7" />
            the blue and white dockets, scrawled and sanded and creased <lb n="8" />
            and bearing the name of the pledger as <persName>Daly</persName> or <persName>MacEvoy</persName>. <lb n="9" />
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">1 Pair Buskins <lb n="10" />
            1 D. Coat <lb n="11" />

            1 Man's Pants<lb n="13" /></said> </p>
            <p> Then he put them aside and gazed thoughtfully at the lid of <lb n="14" />
            the box, speckled with lousemarks, and asked vaguely: <lb n="15" />
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;How much is the clock fast now? <lb n="16" /></said> </p>
            <p> His mother straightened the battered alarmclock that was <lb n="17" />
            lying on its side in the middle of the kitchen mantelpiece until <lb n="18" />
            its dial showed a quarter to twelve and then laid it once more <lb n="19" />
            on its side. <lb n="20" />
            <said who="Mary Dedalus">&#8213;An hour and twentyfive minutes, she said. The right time <lb n="21" />
            now is  twenty past ten. The dear knows you might try to be in <lb n="22" />
            time for your lectures. <lb n="23" /> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;Fill out the place for me to wash, said Stephen. <lb n="24" /> </said>

            <p> When the enamelled basin had  been fitted into the well of <lb n="28" />
            the sink and the old washingglove flung on the side of it he <lb n="29" />
            allowed his mother to scrub his neck and root into the folds of <lb n="30" />
            his ears and into the interstices at the wings of his nose. <lb n="31" />
            <said who="Mary Dedalus">&#8213;Well, it's a poor case, she said, when a university student is <lb n="32" />
            so dirty that his mother has to wash him. <lb n="33" /> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;But it gives you pleasure, said Stephen calmly. <lb n="34" /></said> </p>
            <p> An earsplitting whistle was heard from upstairs and his <lb n="35" />
            mother thrust  a damp overall into his hands, saying: <lb n="36" />
            <said who="Mary Dedalus">&#8213;Dry yourself and hurry out for the love of goodness. <lb n="37" /></said> </p>
            <p> A second shrill whistle, prolonged angrily, brought one of <lb n="38" />
            the girls to the foot of the staircase. <lb n="39" />
            <said who="one of the girls">&#8213;Yes, father?<lb n="40" /> </said>
            <said who="Simon Dedalus">&#8213;Is your lazy bitch of a brother gone out yet? <lb n="41" /> </said>
            <said who="one of the girls">&#8213;Yes, father.<lb n="42" /> </said>
            <said who="Simon Dedalus">&#8213;Sure? <lb n="43" /> </said>
            <said who="one of the girls">&#8213;Yes, father.<lb n="44" /> </said>
            <said who="Simon Dedalus">&#8213;Hm!<lb n="45" /></said> </p>
            <p> The girl came back making signs to him to be quick and go <lb n="46" />
            out quietly by the back. Stephen laughed and said: <lb n="47" />
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;He has  a curious idea of genders if he thinks a bitch is <lb n="48" />
            masculine. <lb n="49" /> </said>
            <said who="Mary Dedalus">&#8213;Ah, it's a scandalous shame for you, <persName>Stephen</persName>, said his <lb n="50" />
            mother, and you'll live to rue the day you set your foot in that <lb n="51" />
            place. I know how it has changed you. <lb n="52" /> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;Good morning, everybody, said Stephen smiling and kissing <lb n="53" />
            the tips of his fingers in adieu. <lb n="54" /></said> </p>
            <p> The lane  behind the terrace was waterlogged and as he went <lb n="55" />
            down it slowly, choosing his steps amid heaps of wet rubbish, <lb n="56" />
            he heard a mad nun screeching in the <place><location><geo>53.364283 -6.244879</geo></location><placeName>nuns' madhouse</placeName></place> beyond <lb n="57" />
            the wall: <lb n="58" />
            <said who="???">&#8213;Jesus! O Jesus! Jesus!<lb n="59" /></said> </p>
            <p> He shook the sound out of his ears by an angry toss of his <lb n="60" />
            head and hurried on, stumbling through the mouldering offal, <lb n="61" />
            his heart already bitten by an ache of loathing and bitterness. <lb n="62" />
            His father's whistle, his mother's mutterings, the screech of an <lb n="63" />
            unseen maniac were to him now so many voices offending and <lb n="64" />
            threatening to humble the pride of his youth. He drove their <lb n="65" />
            echoes even out of his heart with an execration: but as he <lb n="66" />
            walked down the avenue and felt the grey morning light falling <lb n="67" />
            about him through the dripping trees and smelt the strange <lb n="68" />
            wild smell of the wet leaves and bark his soul was loosed of her <lb n="69" />
            miseries.<lb n="70" /> </p>
            <p> The rainladen trees of the avenue evoked in him, as always, <lb n="71" />
            memories of the girls and women in the plays of <persName>Gerhart <lb n="72" />
            Hauptmann</persName>: and the memory of their pale sorrows and the <lb n="73" />
            fragrance falling from the wet branches mingled in a mood of <lb n="74" />
            quiet joy. His morning walk across <place><location><geo>53.363150 -6.270676</geo></location><placeName>the city</placeName></place> had begun: and he <lb n="75" />
            foreknew that as he passed the sloblands of Fairview he would <lb n="76" />
            think of the cloistral silverveined prose of Newman, that as he <lb n="77" />
            walked along <place><location><geo>53.357548 -6.242725</geo></location><placeName>the North Strand Road</placeName></place>, glancing idly at the win- <lb n="78" />
            dows of the provision shops, he would recall the dark humour <lb n="79" />
            of <persName>Guido Cavalcanti</persName> and smile, that as he went by <persName>Baird</persName>'s <lb n="80" />
            stonecutting works in <place><location><geo>53.350416 -6.251694</geo></location><placeName>Talbot Place</placeName></place> the spirit of <persName>Ibsen</persName> would <lb n="81" />
            blow through him like a keen wind, a spirit of wayward boyish <lb n="82" />
            beauty, and that passing a grimy marine dealer's shop beyond <lb n="83" />
            the <placeName>Liffey</placeName> he would repeat the song by <persName>Ben Jonson</persName> which <lb n="84" />
            begins:<lb n="85" /> </p>
            <lg> <l><emph>I was not wearier where I lay.</emph></l></lg> <lb n="86" />
            <p> His mind when wearied of its search for the essence of <lb n="87" />
            beauty amid the spectral words of <persName>Aristotle</persName> or <persName>Aquinas</persName> turned <lb n="88" />
            often for its pleasure to the dainty songs of the Elizabethans. <lb n="89" />
            His mind, in the vesture of a doubting monk, stood often in <lb n="90" />
            shadow under the windows of that age, to hear the grave and <lb n="91" />
            mocking music of the lutenists or the frank laughter of waist- <lb n="92" />
            coateers until a laugh too low, a phrase, tarnished by time, of <lb n="93" />
            chambering and false honour stung his monkish pride and <lb n="94" />
            drove him on from his lurkingplace.<lb n="95" /> </p>
            <p> The lore which he was believed to pass his days brooding <lb n="96" />
            upon so that it had rapt him from the companionships of youth <lb n="97" />
            was only a garner of slender sentences from <persName>Aristotle</persName>'s poetics <lb n="98" />
            and psychology and a <seg xml:lang="la">Synopsis Philosophiae Scholasticae ad <lb n="99" />
            mentem divi Thomae</seg>. His thinking was a dusk of doubt and <lb n="100" />
            selfmistrust lit up at moments by the lightnings of intuition, but <lb n="101" />
            lightnings of so clear a splendour that in those moments the <lb n="102" />
            world perished about his feet as if it had been fireconsumed: <lb n="103" />
            and thereafter his tongue grew heavy and he met the eyes of <lb n="104" />
            others with unanswering eyes for he felt that the spirit of <lb n="105" />
            beauty had folded him round like a mantle and that in revery at <lb n="106" />
            least he had been acquainted with nobility. But when this brief <lb n="107" />
            pride of silence upheld him no longer he was glad to find him- <lb n="108" />
            self still in the midst of common lives, passing on his way amid <lb n="109" />
            the squalor and noise and sloth of the city fearlessly and with a <lb n="110" />
            light heart.<lb n="111" /> </p>
            <p> Near the hoardings on the canal he met the consumptive <lb n="112" />
            man with the doll's face and the brimless hat coming towards <lb n="113" />
            him down the slope of the bridge with little steps, tightly but- <lb n="114" />
            toned into his chocolate overcoat and holding his furled um- <lb n="115" />
            brella a span or two from him like a diviningrod. It must be <lb n="116" />
            eleven, he thought, and peered into a dairy to see the time. The <lb n="117" />
            clock in the dairy told him that it was five minutes to five but, <lb n="118" />
            as he turned away, he heard a clock somewhere near him but <lb n="119" />
            unseen beating eleven strokes in swift precision. He laughed as <lb n="120" />
            he heard it for it made him think of <persName>MacCann</persName> and he saw him <lb n="121" />
            a squat figure in a shooting jacket and breeches and with a fair <lb n="122" />
            goatee standing in the wind at <place><location><geo>53.351242 -6.260779</geo></location><placeName>Hopkins' corner</placeName></place>, and heard him <lb n="123" />
            say: <lb n="124" />
            <said who="MacCann">&#8213;Dedalus, you're an antisocial being, wrapped up in yourself. <lb n="125" />
            I'm not. I'm a democrat: and I'll work and act for social liberty <lb n="126" />
            and equality among all classes and sexes in the United States of <lb n="127" />
            the <placeName>Europe</placeName> of the future. <lb n="128" /></said> </p>
            <p> Eleven! Then he was late for that lecture too. What day of <lb n="129" />
            the week was it? He stopped at a newsagent's to read the <lb n="130" />
            headline of a placard. Thursday.  Ten to eleven; English: eleven <lb n="131" />
            to twelve; French: twelve to one; physics. He fancied to himself <lb n="132" />
            the English lecture and felt, even at that distance, restless and <lb n="133" />
            helpless. He saw the heads of his classmates meekly bent as <lb n="134" />
            they wrote in their notebooks the points they were bidden to <lb n="135" />
            note, nominal definitions, essential definitions and examples or <lb n="136" />
            dates of birth and death, chief works, a favourable and an <lb n="137" />
            unfavourable criticism side by side. His own head was unbent <lb n="138" />
            for his thoughts wandered abroad and whether he looked <lb n="139" />
            around the little class of students or out of the window across <lb n="140" />
            the desolate gardens of the green an odour assailed him of <lb n="141" />
            cheerless cellardamp and decay. Another head than his, right <lb n="142" />
            before him in the first benches, was poised squarely above its <lb n="143" />
            bending fellows like the head of a priest appealing without <lb n="144" />
            humility to the tabernacle for the humble worshippers about <lb n="145" />
            him. Why was it that when he thought of <persName>Cranly</persName> he could <lb n="146" />
            never raise before his mind the entire image of his body but <lb n="147" />
            only the image of the head and face? Even now against the grey <lb n="148" />
            curtain of the morning he saw it before him like the phantom <lb n="149" />
            of a dream, the face of a severed head or deathmask, crowned <lb n="150" />
            on the brows by its stiff black upright hair as by an iron crown. <lb n="151" />
            It was a priestlike face, priestlike in its pallor, in the wide- <lb n="152" />
            winged nose, in the shadowings below the eyes and along the <lb n="153" />
            jaws, priestlike in the lips that were long and bloodless and <lb n="154" />
            faintly smiling: and <persName>Stephen</persName>, remembering swiftly how he had <lb n="155" />
            told <persName>Cranly</persName> of all the tumults and unrest and longings in his <lb n="156" />
            soul, day after day and night by night only to be answered by <lb n="157" />
            his friend's listening silence, would have told himself that it <lb n="158" />
            was the face of a guilty priest who heard confessions of those <lb n="159" />
            whom he had not power to absolve but that he felt again in <lb n="160" />
            memory the gaze of its dark womanish eyes.<lb n="161" /> </p>
            <p> Through this image he had a glimpse of a strange dark <lb n="162" />
            cavern of speculation but at once turned away from it feeling <lb n="163" />
            that it was not yet the hour  to enter it. But the nightshade of his <lb n="164" />
            friend's listlessness seemed to be diffusing in the air around him <lb n="165" />
            a tenuous and deadly exhalation: and he found himself <lb n="166" />
            glancing from one casual word to another on his right or left in <lb n="167" />
            stolid wonder that they had been so silently emptied of instan- <lb n="168" />
            taneous sense until every mean shop legend bound his mind <lb n="169" />
            like the words of a spell and his soul shrivelled up sighing with <lb n="170" />
            age as he walked on in a lane among heaps of dead language. <lb n="171" />
            His own consciousness of language was ebbing from his brain <lb n="172" />
            and trickling into the very words themselves which set to band <lb n="173" />
            and disband themselves in wayward rhythms:<lb n="174" /> </p>
            <lg>
              <l>The ivy whines upon the wall</l> <lb n="175" />
              <l>And whines and twines upon the wall</l> <lb n="176" />
              <l>The ivy whines upon the wall</l> <lb n="177" />
              <l>The yellow ivy on the wall</l> <lb n="178" />
              <l>Ivy, ivy up the wall.</l> <lb n="179" />
            </lg>
            <p> Did any one ever hear such drivel? Lord Almighty! Who ever <lb n="180" />
            heard of ivy whining on a wall? Yellow ivy: that was all right. <lb n="181" />
            Yellow ivory also. And what about ivory ivy?<lb n="182" /> </p>
            <p> The word now shone in his brain, clearer and brighter than <lb n="183" />
            any ivory sawn from the mottled tusks of elephants. <emph>Ivory, <lb n="184" />
            <emph>ivoire</emph>, <seg xml:lang="ita">avorio</seg>, <seg xml:lang="la">ebur</seg>.</emph> One of the first examples that he had <lb n="185" />
            learnt in Latin had run: <seg xml:lang="la">India mittit ebur</seg>; and he recalled the <lb n="186" />
            shrewd northern face of the rector who had taught him to <lb n="187" />
            construe the Metamorphoses of <persName>Ovid</persName> in a courtly English, <lb n="188" />
            made whimsical by the mention of porkers and potsherds and <lb n="189" />
            chines of bacon. He had learnt what little he knew of the laws <lb n="190" />
            of Latin verse from a ragged book written by a Portuguese <lb n="191" />
            priest:<lb n="192" /> </p>
            <p><lg><l><seg xml:lang="la">Contrahit orator, variant in carmine vates.</seg></l></lg><lb n="193" /> </p>
            <p> The crises and victories and secessions in Roman history <lb n="194" />
            were handed on to him in the trite words <seg xml:lang="la">in tanto discrimine</seg> <lb n="195" />
            and he had tried to peer into the social life of the city of cities <lb n="196" />
            through the words <seg xml:lang="la">implere ollam denariorum</seg> which the rector <lb n="197" />
            had rendered sonorously as the filling of a pot with denaries. <lb n="198" />
            The pages of his timeworn <persName>Horace</persName> never felt cold to the touch <lb n="199" />
            even when his own fingers were cold:  they were human pages: <lb n="200" />
            and fifty years before they had been turned by the human <lb n="201" />
            fingers of <persName>John Duncan Inverarity</persName> and by his brother <persName>William <lb n="202" />
            Malcolm Inverarity</persName>. Yes, those were noble names on the dusky <lb n="203" />
            flyleaf and, even for so poor a Latinist as he, the dusky verses <lb n="204" />
            were as fragrant as though they had lain all those years in <lb n="205" />
            myrtle and lavender and vervain: but yet it wounded him to <lb n="206" />
            think that he would never be but a shy guest at the feast of the <lb n="207" />
            world's culture and that the monkish learning, in terms of <lb n="208" />
            which he was striving to forge out an esthetic philosophy, was <lb n="209" />
            held no higher by the age he lived in than the subtle and <lb n="210" />
            curious jargons of heraldry and falconry.<lb n="211" /> </p>
            <p> The grey block <place><location><geo>53.345478 -6.257690</geo></location><placeName>of Trinity</placeName></place> on his left, set heavily in the city's <lb n="212" />
            ignorance like a great dull stone set in a cumbrous ring, pulled <lb n="213" />
            his mind downward: and while he was striving this way and <lb n="214" />
            that to free his feet from the fetters of the reformed conscience <lb n="215" />
            he came upon the droll statue of the national poet of <placeName>Ireland</placeName>.<lb n="216" /> </p>
            <p> He looked at it without anger: for, though sloth of the body <lb n="217" />
            and of  the soul crept over it like unseen vermin, over the <lb n="218" />
            shuffling feet and up the folds of the cloak and around the <lb n="219" />
            servile head, it seemed humbly conscious of its indignity. It <lb n="220" />
            was a <persName>Firbolg</persName> in the borrowed cloak of a Milesian; and he <lb n="221" />
            thought of his friend <persName>Davin</persName>, the peasant student. It was a <lb n="222" />
            jesting name between them but the young peasant bore with it <lb n="223" />
            lightly, saying: <lb n="224" />
            <said who="Davin">&#8213;Go on, Stevie. I have a hard head, you tell me. Call me what <lb n="225" />
            you will. <lb n="226" /></said> </p>
            <p> The homely version of his christian name on the lips of his <lb n="227" />
            friend had touched Stephen pleasantly when first heard for he <lb n="228" />
            was as formal in speech with others as they were with him. <lb n="229" />
            Often, as he sat in <persName>Davin</persName>'s rooms in <place><location><geo>53.334106 -6.266592</geo></location><placeName>Grantham Street</placeName></place>, wonder- <lb n="230" />
            ing at his friend's wellmade boots that flanked the wall pair by <lb n="231" />
            pair and repeating for his friend's simple ear the verses and <lb n="232" />
            cadences of others which were the veils of his own longing and <lb n="233" />
            dejection, the rude <persName>Firbolg</persName> mind of his listener had drawn his <lb n="234" />
            mind towards it and flung it back again, drawing it by a quiet <lb n="235" />
            inbred courtesy of attention or by a quaint turn of old English <lb n="236" />
            speech or by the force of its delight in rude bodily skill - (for <lb n="237" />
            Davin had sat at the feet of <persName>Michael Cusack</persName>, the Gael), <lb n="238" />
            repelling swiftly and suddenly by a grossness of intelligence or <lb n="239" />
            by a bluntness of feeling or by a dull stare of terror in the eyes <lb n="240" />
            the terror of soul of a starving Irish village in which the curfew <lb n="241" />
            was still a nightly fear.<lb n="242" /> </p>
            <p> Side by side with his memory of the deeds of prowess of his <lb n="243" />
            uncle <persName>Mat Davin</persName>, the athlete, the young peasant worshipped <lb n="244" />
            the sorrowful legend of <placeName>Ireland</placeName>. The gossip of his fellowstu- <lb n="245" />
            dents which strove to render the flat life of the college signifi- <lb n="246" />
            cant at any cost loved to think of him as a young fenian. His <lb n="247" />
            nurse had taught him Irish and shaped the rude imagination by <lb n="248" />
            the broken lights of Irish myth. He stood towards this myth <lb n="249" />
            upon which no individual mind had ever drawn out a line of <lb n="250" />
            beauty and to its unwieldy  tales that divided against themselves <lb n="251" />
            as they moved down the cycles in the same attitude as towards <lb n="252" />
            the Roman catholic religion, the attitude of a dullwitted loyal <lb n="253" />
            serf. Whatsoever of thought or of feeling came to him from <lb n="254" />
            England or by way of English culture his mind stood armed <lb n="255" />
            against in obedience to a password: and of the world that lay <lb n="256" />
            beyond England he knew only the foreign legion of <place><location><geo>46.227638 2.213749</geo></location><placeName>France</placeName></place> in <lb n="257" />
            which he spoke of serving.<lb n="258" /> </p>
            <p> Coupling this ambition with the young man's diffident hu- <lb n="259" />
            mour <persName>Stephen</persName> had often called him one of the tame geese: and <lb n="260" />
            there was even a point of irritation in the name pointed against <lb n="261" />
            that very reluctance of speech and deed in his friend which <lb n="262" />
            seemed so often to stand between <persName>Stephen</persName>'s mind, eager of <lb n="263" />
            speculation, and the hidden ways of Irish life.<lb n="264" /> </p>
            <p> One night the young peasant, his spirit stung by the violent <lb n="265" />
            or luxurious language in which <persName>Stephen</persName> escaped from the cold <lb n="266" />
            silence of intellectual revolt, had called up before <persName>Stephen</persName>'s <lb n="267" />
            mind a strange vision. The two were walking slowly towards <lb n="268" />
            Davin's rooms through the dark narrow streets of the poorer <lb n="269" />
            jews. <lb n="270" />
            <said who="Davin">&#8213;A thing happened to myself, <persName>Stevie</persName>, last autumn coming on <lb n="271" />
            winter and I never told it to a living soul and you are the first <lb n="272" />
            person now I ever told it to. I disremember if it was October or <lb n="273" />
            November. It was October because it was before  I came up <lb n="274" />
            here to join the matriculation class. <lb n="275" /></said> </p>
            <p> <persName>Stephen</persName> had turned his smiling eyes towards his friend's <lb n="276" />
            face, flattered by his confidence and won over to sympathy by <lb n="277" />
            the speaker's simple accent. <lb n="278" />
            <said who="Davin">&#8213;I was away all that day from my own place, over in <place><location><geo>52.232134 -8.670125</geo></location><placeName>Butte- <lb n="279" />
            vant</placeName></place> (I don't know if you know where that is) at a hurling <lb n="280" />
            match between the Croke's Own Boys and the Fearless Thurles <lb n="281" />
            and by God, <persName>Stevie</persName>, that was the hard fight. My first cousin <lb n="282" />
            Fonsy Davin was stripped to his buff that day minding cool for <lb n="283" />
            the Limericks but he was up with the forwards half the time <lb n="284" />
            and shouting like mad. I never will forget that day. One of the <lb n="285" />
            Crokes made a woful wipe at him one time with his camaun <lb n="286" />
            and I declare to God he was within an aim's ace of getting it at <lb n="287" />
            the side of the temple. O, honest to God, if the crook of it <lb n="288" />
            caught him that time he was done for. <lb n="289" /> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;I am glad he escaped, Stephen had said with a laugh, but <lb n="290" />
            surely that's not the strange thing  that happened you? <lb n="291" /> </said>
            <said who="Davin">&#8213;Well, I suppose that doesn't interest you but leastways there <lb n="292" />
            was such noise after the match that I missed the train home and <lb n="293" />
            I couldn't get any kind of a yoke to give me a lift for, as luck <lb n="294" />
            would have it, there was a mass meeting that same day over in <lb n="295" />
            <placeName>Castletownroche</placeName>and all the cars in the country were there. So <lb n="296" />
            there was nothing for it only to stay the night or to foot it out. <lb n="297" />
            Well, I started to walk and on I went and it was coming on <lb n="298" />
            night when I got into the  <place><location><geo>52.303056 -8.538611</geo></location><placeName>Ballyhoura hills</placeName></place> that's better than ten <lb n="299" />
            miles from <place><location><geo>52.399821 -8.575387</geo></location><placeName>Kilmallock</placeName></place> and there's a long lonely road after that. <lb n="300" />
            You wouldn't see the sign of a christian house along the road or <lb n="301" />
            hear a sound. It was pitch dark almost. Once or twice I stopped <lb n="302" />
            by the way under a bush to redden my pipe and only for the <lb n="303" />
            dew was thick I'd have stretched out there and slept. At last <lb n="304" />
            after a bend of the road I spied a little cottage with a light in <lb n="305" />
            the window. I went up and knocked at the door. A voice asked <lb n="306" />
            who was there and I answered I was over at the match in <lb n="307" />
            <placeName>Buttevant</placeName> and was walking back and that I'd be thankful for a <lb n="308" />
            glass of water. After a while a young woman opened the door <lb n="309" />
            and brought me out a big mug of milk. She was half undressed <lb n="310" />
            as if she was going to bed when I knocked and she had her hair <lb n="311" />
            hanging: and I thought by her figure and by something in the <lb n="312" />
            look of her eyes that she must be carrying a child. She kept me <lb n="313" />
            in talk a long while at the door and I thought it strange because <lb n="314" />
            her breast and her shoulders were bare. She asked me was I <lb n="315" />
            tired and would I like to stop the night there. She said she was <lb n="316" />
            all alone in the house and that her husband had gone that <lb n="317" />
            morning to <place><location><geo>53.273188 -6.092767</geo></location><placeName>Queenstown</placeName></place> with his sister to see her off. And all <lb n="318" />
            the time she was talking, <persName>Stevie</persName>, she had her eyes fixed on my <lb n="319" />
            face and she stood so close to me I could hear her breathing. <lb n="320" />
            When I handed her back the mug at last she took my hand to <lb n="321" />
            draw me in over the threshold and said: <emph>Come in and stay the <lb n="322" />
            night here. You've no call to be frightened. There's no-one in it <lb n="323" />
            but ourselves</emph> ........ I didn't go in, <persName>Stevie</persName>.  I thanked her and <lb n="324" />
            went on my way again, all in a fever. At the first bend of the <lb n="325" />
            road I looked back and she was standing in the door. <lb n="326" /></said> </p>
            <p> The last words of <persName>Davin</persName>'s story sang in his memory  and the <lb n="327" />
            figure of the woman in the story stood forth reflected in other <lb n="328" />
            figures of the peasant women whom he had seen standing in <lb n="329" />
            the doorways at <place><location><geo>53.293785 -6.687040</geo></location><placeName>Clane</placeName></place> as the college cars drove by, as a type of <lb n="330" />
            her race and his own, a batlike soul waking to the conscious- <lb n="331" />
            ness of itself in darkness and secrecy and loneliness and, <lb n="332" />
            through the eyes and voice and gesture of a woman without <lb n="333" />
            guile, calling the stranger to her bed.<lb n="334" /> </p>
            <p> A hand was laid on his arm and a young voice cried: <lb n="335" />
            <said who="???">&#8213;Ah, gentleman, your own girl, sir! The first handsel today, <lb n="336" />
            gentleman. Buy  that lovely bunch. Will you, gentleman?<lb n="337" /></said> </p>
            <p> The blue flowers which she lifted towards him and her <lb n="338" />
            young blue eyes seemed to him at that instant images of guile- <lb n="339" />
            lessness: and he halted till the image had vanished and he saw <lb n="340" />
            only her ragged dress and damp coarse hair and  hoydenish <lb n="341" />
            face.&gt; <lb n="342" />
            <said who="???">&#8213;Do, gentleman! Don't forget your own girl, sir!<lb n="343" /> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;I have no money, said Stephen. <lb n="344" /> </said>
            <said who="???">&#8213;Buy them lovely ones, will you, sir? Only a penny.<lb n="345" /> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;Did you hear what I said? asked Stephen, bending towards <lb n="346" />
            her. I told you I had no money. I tell you again now.<lb n="347" /> </said>
            <said who="???">&#8213;Well, sure, you will some day, sir, please God, the girl <lb n="348" />
            answered after an instant.<lb n="349" /> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;Possibly, said Stephen, but I don't think it likely. <lb n="350" /></said> </p>
            <p> He left her quickly, fearing that her intimacy might turn to <lb n="351" />
            gibing and wishing to be out of the way before she offered her <lb n="352" />
            ware to another, a tourist from England or a student of Trinity. <place><location><geo>53.342300 -6.259747</geo></location><placeName> <lb n="353" />
            Grafton Street</placeName></place>, along which he walked prolonged that moment <lb n="354" />
            of discouraged poverty. In the roadway at the head of the street <lb n="355" />
            a slab was set to the memory of <persName>Wolfe Tone</persName> and he remem- <lb n="356" />
            bered having been present with his father at its laying. He re- <lb n="357" />
            membered with bitterness that scene of tawdry tribute. There <lb n="358" />
            were four French delegates in a brake and one, a plump smiling <lb n="359" />
            young man, held, wedged on a stick,  a card on which were <lb n="360" />
            printed the words: <seg xml:lang="fr">Vive l'Irlande!</seg><lb n="361" /> </p>
            <p> But the trees in <place><location><geo>53.338174 -6.259119</geo></location><placeName>Stephen's Green</placeName></place> were fragrant of rain and <lb n="362" />
            the rainsodden earth gave forth its mortal odour, a faint in- <lb n="363" />
            cense rising upward through the mould from many hearts. The <lb n="364" />
            soul of the gallant venal city which his elders had told him of <lb n="365" />
            had shrunk with time to a faint mortal odour rising from the <lb n="366" />
            earth and he knew that in a moment when he entered the <lb n="367" />
            sombre college he would be conscious of a corruption other <lb n="368" />
            than that of <persName>Buck Egan</persName> and <persName>Burnchapel Whaley</persName>.<lb n="369" /> </p>
            <p> It was too late to go upstairs to the French class. He crossed <lb n="370" />
            the hall and took the corridor to the left which led to the <lb n="371" />
            physics theatre. The corridor was dark and silent but not un- <lb n="372" />
            watchful. Why did he feel that it was not unwatchful? Was it <lb n="373" />
            because he had heard that in <persName>Buck Whaley</persName>'s time there was a <lb n="374" />
            secret staircase there? Or was the jesuit house extraterritorial <lb n="375" />
            and was he walking among aliens? The <placeName>Ireland</placeName>of <persName>Tone</persName> and of <lb n="376" />
            <persName>Parnell</persName> seemed to have receded in space.<lb n="377" /> </p>
            <p> He opened the door of the theatre and halted in the chilly <lb n="378" />
            grey light that struggled through the dusty windows. A figure <lb n="379" />
            was crouching before the large grate and by its leanness and <lb n="380" />
            greyness he knew that it was the dean of studies lighting the <lb n="381" />
            fire. Stephen closed the door quietly and approached the fire- <lb n="382" />
            place. <lb n="383" />
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;Good morning, sir! Can I help you?<lb n="384" /></said> </p>
            <p> The priest looked up quickly and said: <lb n="385" />
            <said who="???">&#8213;One moment now, Mr Dedalus, and you will see. There is <lb n="386" />
            an art in lighting a fire. We have the liberal arts and we have <lb n="387" />
            the useful arts. This is one of the useful arts.<lb n="388" /> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;I will try to learn it, said Stephen.<lb n="389" /> </said>
            <said who="???">&#8213;Not too much coal, said the dean, working briskly at his <lb n="390" />
            task, that is one of the secrets.<lb n="391" /></said> </p>
            <p> He produced four candle butts from the sidepockets of his <lb n="392" />
            soutane and placed them deftly among the coals and twisted <lb n="393" />
            papers. Stephen watched him in silence. Kneeling thus on the <lb n="394" />
            flagstone to kindle the fire and busied with the disposition of <lb n="395" />
            his wisps of paper and candle butts he seemed more than ever a <lb n="396" />
            humble server making ready the place of sacrifice in an empty <lb n="397" />
            temple, a levite of the Lord. Like a levite's robe of plain linen <lb n="398" />
            the faded worn soutane draped the kneeling figure of one <lb n="399" />
            whom the canonicals or the  bellbordered ephod would irk and <lb n="400" />
            trouble. His very body had waxed old in lowly service of the <lb n="401" />
            Lord &#8211; in tending the fire upon the altar, in bearing tidings se- <lb n="402" />
            cretly, in waiting upon worldlings, in striking swiftly when <lb n="403" />
            bidden &#8211; and yet had remained ungraced by aught of saintly or <lb n="404" />
            of prelatic beauty. Nay, his very soul had waxed old in that <lb n="405" />
            service without growing towards light and beauty or spreading <lb n="406" />
            abroad a sweet odour of her sanctity &#8211; a mortified will no more <lb n="407" />
            responsive to the thrill of its obedience than was to the thrill of <lb n="408" />
            love or combat his aging body, spare and sinewy, greyed with a <lb n="409" />
            silverpointed down.<lb n="410" /> </p>
            <p> The dean rested back on his hunkers and watched the sticks <lb n="411" />
            catch. Stephen, to fill the silence, said: <lb n="412" />
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;I am sure I could not light a fire.<lb n="413" /> </said>
            <said who="???">&#8213;You are an artist, are you not, Mr Dedalus? said the dean, <lb n="414" />
            glancing up and blinking his pale eyes. The object of the artist <lb n="415" />
            is the creation of the beautiful. What the beautiful is is another <lb n="416" />
            question.<lb n="417" /></said> </p>
            <p> He rubbed his hands slowly and drily over the difficulty. <lb n="418" />
            <said who="???">&#8213;Can you solve that question now? he asked.<lb n="419" /> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;Aquinas, answered Stephen, says <seg xml:lang="la">Pulcra sunt quae visa <lb n="420" />
            placent</seg>.<lb n="421" /> </said>
            <said who="???">&#8213;This fire before us, said the dean, will be pleasing to the eye. <lb n="422" />
            Will it therefore be beautiful?<lb n="423" /> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;In so far as it is apprehended by the sight, which I suppose <lb n="424" />
            means here esthetic intellection, it will be beautiful. But Aqui- <lb n="425" />
            nas also says <seg xml:lang="la">Bonum est in quod tendit appetitus</seg>. In so far as it <lb n="426" />
            satisfies the animal craving for warmth fire is a good. In hell <lb n="427" />
            however it is an evil.<lb n="428" /> </said>
            <said who="???">&#8213;Quite so, said the dean, you have certainly hit the nail on the <lb n="429" />
            head.<lb n="430" /></said> </p>
            <p> He rose nimbly and went towards the door, set it ajar and <lb n="431" />
            said: <lb n="432" />
            <said who="???">&#8213;A draught is said to be a help in these matters.<lb n="433" /></said> </p>
            <p> As he came back to the hearth, limping slightly but with a <lb n="434" />
            brisk step, Stephen saw the silent soul of a jesuit look out at <lb n="435" />
            him from the pale loveless eyes. Like Ignatius he was lame but <lb n="436" />
            in his eyes burned no spark of Ignatius' enthusiasm. Even the <lb n="437" />
            legendary craft of the company, a craft subtler and more secret <lb n="438" />
            than its fabled books of secret subtle wisdom, had not fired his <lb n="439" />
            soul with the energy of apostleship. It seemed as if he used the <lb n="440" />
            shifts and lore and cunning of the world, as bidden to do, for <lb n="441" />
            the greater glory of God, without joy in their handling or <lb n="442" />
            hatred of that in them which was evil but turning them, with a <lb n="443" />
            firm gesture of obedience, back upon themselves: and for all <lb n="444" />
            this silent service it seemed as if he loved not at all the master <lb n="445" />
            and little, if at all, the ends he served. <seg xml:lang="la">Similiter atque senis <lb n="446" />
            baculus</seg>, he was, as the founder would have had him, like a <lb n="447" />
            staff in an old man's hand, to be left in a corner, to be leaned <lb n="448" />
            on in the road at nightfall or in stress of weather,  to lie with a <lb n="449" />
            lady's nosegay on a garden seat, to be raised in menace.<lb n="450" /> </p>
            <p> The dean returned to the hearth and began to stroke his <lb n="451" />
            chin. <lb n="452" />
            <said who="???">&#8213;When may we expect to have something from you on the <lb n="453" />
            esthetic question? he asked.<lb n="454" /> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;From me! said Stephen in astonishment. I stumble on  an idea <lb n="455" />
            once a fortnight if I am lucky.<lb n="456" /> </said>
            <said who="???">&#8213;These questions are very profound, Mr Dedalus, said the <lb n="457" />
            dean. It is like looking down from the <place><location><geo>53.545240 -7.943510</geo></location><placeName>cliffs of Moher</placeName></place> into the <lb n="458" />
            depths. Many go down into the depths and never come up. <lb n="459" />
            Only the trained diver can go down into those depths and <lb n="460" />
            explore them and come to the surface again.<lb n="461" /> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;If you mean speculation, sir, said Stephen, I also am sure <lb n="462" />
            that there is no such thing  as free thinking inasmuch as all <lb n="463" />
            thinking must be bound by its own laws.<lb n="464" /> </said>
            <said who="???">&#8213;Ha!<lb n="465" /> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;For my purpose I can work on at present by the light of one <lb n="466" />
            or two ideas of Aristotle and Aquinas.<lb n="467" /> </said>
            <said who="???">&#8213;I see. I quite see your point.<lb n="468" /> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;I need them only for my own use and guidance until I have <lb n="469" />
            done something for myself by their light. If the lamp smokes or <lb n="470" />
            smells I shall try to trim it. If it does not give light enough I <lb n="471" />
            shall sell it and buy or borrow another.<lb n="472" /> </said>
            <said who="???">&#8213;Epictetus also had a lamp, said the dean, which was sold for <lb n="473" />
            a fancy price after his death. It was the lamp he wrote his <lb n="474" />
            philosophical dissertations by. You know Epictetus?<lb n="475" /> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;An old gentleman, said Stephen coarsely, who said that the <lb n="476" />
            soul is very like a bucketful of water.<lb n="477" /> </said>
            <said who="???">&#8213;He tells us in his homely way, the dean went on, that he put <lb n="478" />
            an iron lamp before a statue of one of the gods and that a thief <lb n="479" />
            stole the lamp. What did the philosopher do? He reflected that <lb n="480" />
            it was in the character of a thief to steal and determined to buy <lb n="481" />
            an earthen lamp next day instead of the iron lamp.<lb n="482" /></said> </p>
            <p> A smell  of molten  tallow came up from the dean's candle <lb n="483" />
            butts and fused itself in Stephen's consciousness with the jingle <lb n="484" />
            of the words, bucket and lamp and lamp and bucket. The <lb n="485" />
            priest's voice too had a hard jingling tone. Stephen's mind <lb n="486" />
            halted by instinct, checked by the strange tone and the  imagery <lb n="487" />
            and by the priest's face which seemed like an unlit lamp or a <lb n="488" />
            reflector hung in a false focus. What lay behind it or within it? <lb n="489" />
            A dull torpor of the soul or the dullness of the thundercloud, <lb n="490" />
            charged with intellection and capable of the gloom of God? <lb n="491" />
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;I meant a different kind of lamp, sir, said Stephen.<lb n="492" /> </said>
            <said who="???">&#8213;Undoubtedly, said the dean.<lb n="493" /> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;One difficulty, said Stephen, in esthetic discussion is to <lb n="494" />
            know whether words are being used according to the literary <lb n="495" />
            tradition or according to the tradition of the marketplace. I <lb n="496" />
            remember a sentence of Newman's in which he says of the <lb n="497" />
            Blessed Virgin that she was detained in the full company of the <lb n="498" />
            saints. The use of the word in the marketplace is quite differ- <lb n="499" />
            ent. <emph>I hope I am not detaining you.</emph><lb n="500" /> </said>
            <said who="???">&#8213;Not in the least, said the dean politely.<lb n="501" /> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;No, no, said Stephen smiling, I mean ....<lb n="502" /> </said>
            <said who="???">&#8213;Yes, yes: I see, said the dean quickly, I quite catch the point: <lb n="503" />
            <emph>detain</emph>.<lb n="504" /></said> </p>
            <p> He thrust forward his under jaw and uttered a dry short <lb n="505" />
            cough. <lb n="506" />
            <said who="???">&#8213;To return to the lamp, he said, the feeding of it is also a nice <lb n="507" />
            problem. You must choose the pure oil and you must be careful <lb n="508" />
            when you pour it in not to overflow it, not to pour in more <lb n="509" />
            than the funnel can hold.<lb n="510" /> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;What funnel? asked Stephen.<lb n="511" /> </said>
            <said who="???">&#8213;The funnel through which you pour the  oil into your lamp.<lb n="512" /> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;That? said Stephen. Is that called a funnel? Is it not a tun- <lb n="513" />
            dish?<lb n="514" /> </said>

            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;That. The ... the funnel.<lb n="516" /> </said>
            <said who="???">&#8213;Is that called a tundish in Ireland? asked the dean. I never <lb n="517" />
            heard the word in my life.<lb n="518" /> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;It is called a tundish in <place><location><geo>53.364757 -6.256734</geo></location><placeName>Lower Drumcondra</placeName></place>, said Stephen <lb n="519" />
            laughing, where they speak the best English.<lb n="520" /> </said>
            <said who="???">&#8213;A tundish! said the dean reflectively. That is a most interest- <lb n="521" />
            ing word. I must look that word up. Upon my word I must.<lb n="522" /></said> </p>
            <p> His courtesy of manner rang a little false and Stephen looked <lb n="523" />
            at the English convert with the same eyes as the elder brother in <lb n="524" />
            the parable may have turned on the prodigal. A humble fol- <lb n="525" />
            lower in the wake of clamorous conversions,  a poor English- <lb n="526" />
            man in Ireland, he seemed to have entered on the stage of jesuit <lb n="527" />
            history when that strange play of intrigue and suffering and <lb n="528" />
            envy and struggle and indignity had been all but given through <lb n="529" />
            &#8211; a latecomer, a tardy spirit.  From what had he set out? Per- <lb n="530" />
            haps he had been born and bred among serious dissenters, <lb n="531" />
            seeing salvation in Jesus only and abhorring the vain pomps of <lb n="532" />
            the establishment. Had he felt the need of an implicit faith <lb n="533" />
            amid the welter of sectarianism and the jargon of its turbulent <lb n="534" />
            schisms, six principle men, peculiar people, seed and snake <lb n="535" />
            baptists, supralapsarian dogmatists? Had he found the true <lb n="536" />
            church all of a sudden in winding up to the end like a reel of <lb n="537" />
            cotton some finespun line of reasoning upon insufflation or the <lb n="538" />
            imposition of hands or the procession of the Holy Ghost? Or <lb n="539" />
            had Lord Christ touched him and bidden him follow, like that <lb n="540" />
            disciple who had sat at the receipt of custom, as he sat by the <lb n="541" />
            door of some zincroofed chapel, yawning and telling over his <lb n="542" />
            church pence?<lb n="543" /> </p>
            <p> The dean repeated the word yet again. <lb n="544" />
            <said who="???">&#8213;Tundish! Well now, that is interesting!<lb n="545" /> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;The question you asked me a moment ago seems to me more <lb n="546" />
            interesting. What is that beauty which the artist struggles to <lb n="547" />
            express from lumps of earth, said Stephen coldly.<lb n="548" /></said> </p>
            <p> The little word seemed to have turned a rapier point of his <lb n="549" />
            sensitiveness against this courteous and vigilant foe. He felt <lb n="550" />
            with a smart of dejection that the man to whom he was speak- <lb n="551" />
            ing was a countryman of Ben Jonson. He thought: <lb n="552" />
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;The language in which we are speaking is his before it is <lb n="553" />
            mine. How different are the words <emph>home, Christ, ale, master</emph> on <lb n="554" />
            his lips and on mine! I cannot speak or write these words with- <lb n="555" />
            out unrest of spirit. His language, so familiar and so foreign, <lb n="556" />
            will always be for me an acquired speech. I have not made or <lb n="557" />
            accepted its words. My voice holds them at bay. My soul frets <lb n="558" />
            in the shadow of his language.<lb n="559" /> </said>
            <said who="???">&#8213;And to distinguish between the beautiful and the sublime, <lb n="560" />
            the dean added. To distinguish between moral beauty and ma- <lb n="561" />
            terial beauty. And to inquire what kind of  beauty is proper to <lb n="562" />
            each of the various arts. These are some interesting points we <lb n="563" />
            might take up.<lb n="564" /></said> </p>
            <p> Stephen, disheartened suddenly by the dean's firm dry tone, <lb n="565" />
            was silent. The dean also was silent: and through the silence a <lb n="566" />
            distant noise of many boots and confused voices came up the <lb n="567" />
            staircase. <lb n="568" />
            <said who="???">&#8213;In pursuing  these speculations, said the dean conclusively, <lb n="569" />
            there is however the danger of perishing of inanition. First you <lb n="570" />
            must take your degree. Set that before you as your first aim. <lb n="571" />
            Then, little by little, you will see your way. I mean in every <lb n="572" />
            sense, your way in life and in thinking. It may be uphill pedal- <lb n="573" />
            ling at first. Take Mr Moonan. He was a long time before he <lb n="574" />
            got to the top. But he got there.<lb n="575" /> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;I may not have his talent, said Stephen quietly.<lb n="576" /> </said>
            <said who="???">&#8213;You never know, said the dean brightly. We never can say <lb n="577" />
            what is in us. I most certainly should not be despondent. <seg xml:lang="la">Per <lb n="578" />
            aspera ad astra.</seg><lb n="579" /></said> </p>
            <p> He left the hearth quickly and went towards the landing to <lb n="580" />
            oversee the arrival of the first arts' class.<lb n="581" /> </p>
            <p> Leaning against the fireplace Stephen heard him greet briskly <lb n="582" />
            and impartially every student of the class and could almost see <lb n="583" />
            the frank smiles of the coarser students. A desolating pity be- <lb n="584" />
            gan to fall like a dew upon his easily embittered heart for this <lb n="585" />
            faithful servingman of the knightly Loyola, for this halfbrother <lb n="586" />
            of the clergy, more venal than they in speech, more steadfast of <lb n="587" />
            soul than they, one whom he would never call his ghostly fa- <lb n="588" />
            ther: and he thought how this man and his companions had <lb n="589" />
            earned the name of worldlings at the hands not of the un- <lb n="590" />
            worldly only but of the worldly also for having pleaded, during <lb n="591" />
            all their history, at the bar of God's justice for the souls of the <lb n="592" />
            lax and the lukewarm and the prudent.<lb n="593" /> </p>
            <p> The entry of the professor was signalled by a few rounds of <place><location><geo>51.278708 0.521725</geo></location> <lb n="594" />
            <placeName>Kentish</placeName></place> fire from the heavy boots of those students who sat on <lb n="595" />
            the highest tier of the gloomy theatre under the grey cob- <lb n="596" />
            webbed windows. The calling of the roll began and the re- <lb n="597" />
            sponses to the names were given out in all tones until the name <lb n="598" />
            of Peter Byrne was reached. <lb n="599" />
            <said who="???">&#8213;Here!<lb n="600" /></said> </p>
            <p> A deep bass note in response came from the upper tier, <lb n="601" />
            followed by coughs of protest along the other benches.<lb n="602" /> </p>
            <p> The professor paused in his reading and called the next <lb n="603" />
            name: <lb n="604" />
            <said who="???">&#8213;Cranly!<lb n="605" /></said> </p>
            <p> No answer. <lb n="606" />
            <said who="???">&#8213;Mr Cranly!<lb n="607" /></said> </p>
            <p> A smile flew across Stephen's face as he thought of his <lb n="608" />
            friend's studies. <lb n="609" />
            <said who="???">&#8213;Try <place><location><geo>53.267776 -6.198408</geo></location><placeName>Leopardstown</placeName></place>! said a voice from the bench behind.<lb n="610" /></said> </p>
            <p> Stephen glanced up quickly but Moynihan's snoutish face <lb n="611" />
            outlined on the grey light was impassive. A formula was given <lb n="612" />
            out. Amid the rustling of the notebooks Stephen turned back <lb n="613" />
            again and said: <lb n="614" />
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;Give me some paper for God' sake.<lb n="615" /> </said>
            <said who="???">&#8213;Are you as bad as that? asked Moynihan with a broad grin.<lb n="616" /></said> </p>
            <p> He tore a sheet from his scribbler and passed it down, whis- <lb n="617" />
            pering: <lb n="618" />
            <said who="???">&#8213;In case of necessity any layman or woman can do it.<lb n="619" /></said> </p>
            <p> The formula which he wrote obediently on the sheet of <lb n="620" />
            paper, the coiling and uncoiling calculations of the professor, <lb n="621" />
            the spectrelike symbols of force and velocity fascinated and <lb n="622" />
            jaded Stephen's mind. He had heard some say that the old <lb n="623" />
            professor was an atheist freemason. O the grey dull day! It <lb n="624" />
            seemed a limbo of painless patient consciousness through <lb n="625" />
            which souls of mathematicians might wander, projecting long <lb n="626" />
            slender fabrics from plane to plane of ever rarer and paler <lb n="627" />
            twilight, radiating swift eddies to the last verges of a universe <lb n="628" />
            ever vaster, farther and more impalpable. <lb n="629" />
            <said who="???">&#8213;So we must distinguish between elliptical and ellipsoidal. <lb n="630" />
            Perhaps some of you gentlemen may be familiar with the works <lb n="631" />
            of Mr W. S. Gilbert. In one of his songs he speaks of the <lb n="632" />
            billiard sharp who is condemned to play: <lb n="633" />
            <lg type="song">
              <l>On a cloth untrue</l> <lb n="634" />
              <l>With a twisted cue</l> <lb n="635" />
              <l>And elliptical billiard balls.</l> <lb n="636" />
            </lg>
            He means a ball having the form of the ellipsoid of the princi- <lb n="637" />
            pal axes of which I spoke a moment ago.<lb n="638" /></said> </p>
            <p> Moynihan leaned down towards Stephen's ear and mur- <lb n="639" />
            mured: <lb n="640" />
            <said who="???">&#8213;What price ellipsoidal balls! Chase me, ladies, I'm in the <lb n="641" />
            cavalry!<lb n="642" /></said> </p>
            <p> His fellowstudent's rude humour ran like a gust through the <lb n="643" />
            cloister of Stephen's mind, shaking into gay life limp priestly <lb n="644" />
            vestments that hung upon the walls, setting them to sway and <lb n="645" />
            caper in a sabbath of misrule. The forms of the community <lb n="646" />
            emerged from the gustblown vestments, the dean of studies, <lb n="647" />
            the portly florid bursar with his cap of grey hair, the president, <lb n="648" />
            the little priest with feathery hair who wrote devout verses, the <lb n="649" />
            squat peasant form of the professor of economics, the tall form <lb n="650" />
            of the young professor of mental science discussing on the <lb n="651" />
            landing a case of conscience with his class like a giraffe crop- <lb n="652" />
            ping high leafage among a herd of antelopes, the grave troubled <lb n="653" />
            prefect of the sodality, the plump roundheaded professor of <lb n="654" />
            Italian with his rogue's eyes. They came ambling and stum- <lb n="655" />
            bling, tumbling and capering, kilting their gowns for leap frog, <lb n="656" />
            holding one another back, shaken with deep false laughter, <lb n="657" />
            smacking one another behind and laughing at their rude mal- <lb n="658" />
            ice, calling to one another by familiar nicknames, protesting <lb n="659" />
            with sudden dignity at some rough usage, whispering two and <lb n="660" />
            two behind their hands.<lb n="661" /> </p>
            <p> The professor had gone to the glass cases on the sidewall <lb n="662" />
            from a shelf of which he took down a set of coils, blew away <lb n="663" />
            the dust from many points and, bearing it carefully to the table, <lb n="664" />
            held a finger on it while he proceeded with his lecture. He <lb n="665" />
            explained that the wires in modern coils were of a compound <lb n="666" />
            called platinoid lately discovered by F. W. Martino.<lb n="667" /> </p>
            <p> He spoke clearly the initials and surname of the discoverer. <lb n="668" />
            Moynihan whispered from behind: <lb n="669" />
            <said who="???">&#8213;Good old Fresh Water Martin!<lb n="670" /> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;Ask him, Stephen whispered back with weary humour, if he <lb n="671" />
            wants a subject for electrocution. He can have me.<lb n="672" /></said> </p>
            <p> Moynihan, seeing the professor bend over the coils, rose in <lb n="673" />
            his bench and, clacking noiselessly the fingers of his right hand, <lb n="674" />
            began to call with the voice of a slobbering urchin: <lb n="675" />
            <said who="???">&#8213;Please, teacher! Please, teacher! This boy is after saying a <lb n="676" />
            bad word, teacher.<lb n="677" /> </said>
            <said who="???">&#8213;Platinoid, the professor said solemnly, is preferred to Ger- <lb n="678" />
            man silver because it has a lower coefficient of resistance <lb n="679" />
            variation by changes of temperature. The platinoid wire is in- <lb n="680" />
            sulated and the covering of silk that insulates it is wound <lb n="681" />
            double on the ebonite bobbins just where my finger is. If it <lb n="682" />
            were wound single an extra current would be induced in the <lb n="683" />
            coils. The bobbins are saturated in hot paraffinwax ...<lb n="684" /></said> </p>
            <p> A sharp <place><location><geo>54.407332 -7.024250</geo></location><placeName>Ulster</placeName></place> voice said from the bench below Stephen: <lb n="685" />
            <said who="???">&#8213;Are we  likely to be asked questions on applied science?<lb n="686" /></said> </p>
            <p> The professor began to juggle gravely with the terms pure <lb n="687" />
            science and applied science. A heavybuilt student wearing gold <lb n="688" />
            spectacles stared with some wonder at the questioner. Moyni- <lb n="689" />
            han murmured from behind in his natural voice: <lb n="690" />
            <said who="???">&#8213;Isn't MacAlister a devil for his pound of flesh?<lb n="691" /></said> </p>
            <p> Stephen looked down coldly on the oblong skull beneath <lb n="692" />
            him overgrown with tangled twinecoloured hair. The voice, the <lb n="693" />
            accent, the mind of the questioner offended him and he allowed <lb n="694" />
            the offence to carry  him towards wilful unkindness, bidding his <lb n="695" />
            mind think that the student's father would have done better <lb n="696" />
            had he sent his son to <place><location><geo>54.597285 -5.930120</geo></location><placeName>Belfast</placeName></place> to study and have saved some- <lb n="697" />
            thing on the trainfare by so doing.<lb n="698" /> </p>
            <p> The oblong skull beneath did not turn to meet this shaft of <lb n="699" />
            thought and yet the shaft came back to its bowstring: for he <lb n="700" />
            saw in a moment the student's wheypale face. <lb n="701" />
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;That thought is not mine, he said to himself quickly. It came <lb n="702" />
            from the comic Irishman in the bench behind. Patience. Can <lb n="703" />
            you say with certitude by whom the soul of your race was <lb n="704" />
            bartered and its elect betrayed &#8211; by the questioner or  by the <lb n="705" />
            mocker? Patience. Remember Epictetus. It is probably in his <lb n="706" />
            character to ask such a question at such a moment in such a <lb n="707" />
            tone and to pronounce the word <emph>science</emph> as a monosyllable.<lb n="708" /></said> </p>
            <p> The droning voice of the professor continued to wind itself <lb n="709" />
            slowly round and round the coils it spoke of, doubling, <lb n="710" />
            trebling, quadrupling its somnolent energy as the coil multi- <lb n="711" />
            plied its ohms of resistance.<lb n="712" /> </p>
            <p> Moynihan's voice called from behind in echo to a distant <lb n="713" />
            bell: <lb n="714" />
            <said who="???">&#8213;Closing time, gents!<lb n="715" /></said> </p>
            <p> The entrance hall was crowded and loud with talk. On a <lb n="716" />
            table near the door were two photographs in frames and be- <lb n="717" />
            tween them a long roll of paper bearing an irregular tail of <lb n="718" />
            signatures. MacCann went briskly to and fro among the stu- <lb n="719" />
            dents, talking rapidly, answering rebuffs and leading one after <lb n="720" />
            another to the table. In the inner hall the dean of studies stood <lb n="721" />
            talking to a young professor, stroking his chin gravely and nod- <lb n="722" />
            ding his head.<lb n="723" /> </p>
            <p> Stephen,  checked by the crowd at the door, halted irresol- <lb n="724" />
            utely. From under the wide falling leaf of a soft hat Cranly's <lb n="725" />
            dark eyes were watching him. <lb n="726" />
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;Have you signed? Stephen asked.<lb n="727" /></said> </p>
            <p> Cranly closed his long thinlipped mouth, communed with <lb n="728" />
            himself an instant and answered: <lb n="729" />

            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;What is it for?<lb n="731" /> </said>
            <said who="Cranly">&#8213;<seg xml:lang="la">Quod?</seg><lb n="732" /> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;What is it for?<lb n="734" /></said> </p>
            <p> Cranly turned his pale face to Stephen and said blandly and <lb n="734" />
            bitterly: <lb n="735" />
            <said who="Cranly">&#8213;<seg xml:lang="la">Per pax universalis.</seg><lb n="736" /></said> </p>
            <p> Stephen pointed to the Czar's photograph and said: <lb n="737" />
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;He has the face of a besotted Christ.<lb n="738" /></said> </p>
            <p> The scorn and anger in his voice brought Cranly's eyes back <lb n="739" />
            from a calm survey of the walls of the hall. <lb n="740" />
            <said who="Cranly">&#8213;Are you annoyed? he asked.<lb n="741" /> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;No, answered Stephen.<lb n="742" /> </said>
            <said who="Cranly">&#8213;Are you in bad humour?<lb n="743" /> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;No.<lb n="744" /></said> </p>
            <p> <said who="Cranly">&#8213;<seg xml:lang="la">Credo ut vos sanguinarius mendax estis</seg>, said Cranly, <seg xml:lang="la">quia <lb n="745" />
            facies vostra monstrat ut vos in damno malo humore estis.</seg><lb n="746" /></said> </p>
            <p> Moynihan, on his way to the table, said in Stephen's ear: <lb n="747" />
            <said who="Moynihan">&#8213;MacCann is in tiptop form. Ready to shed the last drop. <lb n="748" />
            Brandnew world. No stimulants and votes for the bitches.<lb n="749" /></said> </p>
            <p> Stephen smiled at the manner of this confidence and, when <lb n="750" />
            Moynihan had passed, turned again to meet Cranly's eyes. <lb n="751" />
            <said who="???">&#8213;Perhaps you can tell me, he said, why he pours his soul so <lb n="752" />
            freely into my ear. Can you?<lb n="753" /></said> </p>
            <p> A dull scowl appeared on Cranly's forehead. He stared at <lb n="754" />
            the table where Moynihan had bent to write his name on the <lb n="755" />
            roll, and then said flatly: <lb n="756" />
            <said who="???">&#8213;A sugar!<lb n="757" /> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">"&gt;&#8213;<seg xml:lang="la">Quis est in malo humore</seg>, said Stephen, <seg xml:lang="la">ego aut vos?</seg><lb n="758" /></said> </p>
            <p> Cranly did not take up the taunt. He brooded sourly on his <lb n="759" />
            judgment and repeated with the same flat force: <lb n="760" />
            <said who="???">&#8213;A flaming bloody sugar, that's what he is!<lb n="761" /></said> </p>
            <p> It was his epitaph for all dead friendships and Stephen won- <lb n="762" />
            dered whether it would ever be spoken in the same tone over <lb n="763" />
            his memory. The heavy lumpish phrase sank slowly out of <lb n="764" />
            hearing like a stone through a quagmire. Stephen saw it sink as <lb n="765" />
            he had seen many an other, feeling its heaviness depress his <lb n="766" />
            heart. Cranly's speech, unlike that of Davin, had neither rare <lb n="767" />
            phrases of Elizabethan English nor quaintly turned versions of <lb n="768" />
            Irish idioms. Its drawl was an echo of the quays of Dublin <lb n="769" />
            given back by a bleak decaying seaport, its energy an echo of <lb n="770" />
            the sacred eloquence of Dublin given back flatly by a <place><location><geo>52.979861 -6.048263</geo></location><placeName>Wicklow</placeName></place> <lb n="771" />
            pulpit.<lb n="772" /> </p>
            <p> The heavy scowl faded from Cranly's face as MacCann <lb n="773" />
            marched briskly towards them from the other side of the hall. <lb n="774" />
            <said who="???">&#8213;Here you are! said MacCann cheerily.<lb n="775" /> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;Here I am! said Stephen.<lb n="776" /> </said>
            <said who="???">&#8213;Late as usual. Can you not combine the progressive tendency <lb n="777" />
            with a respect for punctuality?<lb n="778" /> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;That question is out of order, said Stephen. Next business.<lb n="779" /></said> </p>
            <p> His smiling eyes were fixed on a silverwrapped tablet of milk <lb n="780" />
            chocolate which peeped out of the propagandist's breastpocket. <lb n="781" />
            A little ring of listeners closed round to hear the war of wits. A <lb n="782" />
            lean student with olive skin and lank black hair thrust his face <lb n="783" />
            between the two, glancing from one to the other at each phrase <lb n="784" />
            and seeming to try to catch each flying phrase in his open moist <lb n="785" />
            mouth. Cranly took a small grey handball from his pocket and <lb n="786" />
            began to examine it closely, turning it over and over. <lb n="787" />
            <said who="???">&#8213;Next business? said MacCann. Hom!<lb n="788" /></said> </p>
            <p> He gave a loud cough of laughter, smiled broadly and <lb n="789" />
            tugged twice at  the strawcoloured goatee which hung from his <lb n="790" />
            blunt chin. <lb n="791" />
            <said who="???">&#8213;The next business is to sign the testimonial.<lb n="792" /> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;Will you pay me anything if I sign? asked Stephen.<lb n="793" /> </said>
            <said who="???">&#8213;I thought you were an idealist, said MacCann.<lb n="794" /></said> </p>
            <p> The gipsylike student looked about him and addressed the <lb n="795" />
            onlookers in an indistinct bleating voice. <lb n="796" />
            <said who="???">&#8213;By hell, that's a queer notion. I consider that notion to be a <lb n="797" />
            mercenary notion.<lb n="798" /></said> </p>
            <p> His voice faded into silence. No heed was paid to his words. <lb n="799" />
            He turned his olive face, equine in expression, towards Ste- <lb n="800" />
            phen, inviting him to speak again.<lb n="801" /> </p>
            <p> MacCann began to speak with fluent energy of the Czar's <lb n="802" />
            rescript, of Stead, of general disarmament, arbitration in cases <lb n="803" />
            of international disputes, of the signs of the times, of the new <lb n="804" />
            humanity and the new gospel of life which would make it the <lb n="805" />
            business of the community to secure as cheaply as possible the <lb n="806" />
            greatest possible happiness of the greatest possible number.<lb n="807" /> </p>
            <p> The gipsy student responded to the close of the period by <lb n="808" />
            crying: <lb n="809" />
            <said who="???">&#8213;Three cheers for universal brotherhood!<lb n="810" /> </said>
            <said who="???">&#8213;Go on, Temple, said a stout ruddy student near him. I'll <lb n="811" />
            stand you a pint after.<lb n="812" /> </said>
            <said who="???">&#8213;I'm a believer in universal brotherhood, said Temple, <lb n="813" />
            glancing about him out of his dark oval eyes. Marx is only a <lb n="814" />
            bloody cod.<lb n="815" /></said> </p>
            <p> Cranly gripped his arm tightly to check his tongue, smiling <lb n="816" />
            uneasily, and repeated: <lb n="817" />
            <said who="???">&#8213;Easy, easy, easy!<lb n="818" /></said> </p>
            <p> Temple struggled to free his arm but continued, his mouth <lb n="819" />
            flecked by a thin foam: <lb n="820" />
            <said who="???">&#8213;Socialism was founded by an Irishman and the first man in <lb n="821" />
            Europe who preached the freedom of thought was Collins. Two <lb n="822" />
            hundred years ago. He denounced priestcraft. The philosopher <lb n="823" />
            of <place><location><geo>51.520987 -0.415985</geo></location><placeName>Middlesex</placeName></place>. Three cheers for John Anthony Collins!<lb n="824" /></said> </p>
            <p> A thin voice from the verge of the ring replied: <lb n="825" />
            <said who="???">&#8213;Pip! pip!<lb n="826" /></said> </p>
            <p> Moynihan murmured beside Stephen's ear: <lb n="827" />
            <said who="???">&#8213;And what about John Anthony's poor little sister: <lb n="828" />
            <lg>
              <l>Lottie Collins lost her drawers;</l> <lb n="829" />
              <l>Won't you kindly lend her yours?</l> <lb n="830" />
            </lg>
            </said></p>
            <p> Stephen laughed and Moynihan, pleased with the result, <lb n="831" />
            murmured again: <lb n="832" />
            <said who="???">&#8213;We'll have five bob each way on John Anthony Collins.<lb n="833" /> </said>
            <said who="???">&#8213;I am waiting for your answer, said MacCann briefly.<lb n="834" /> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;The affair doesn't interest me in the least, said Stephen <lb n="835" />
            wearily. You knew that well. Why do you make a scene about <lb n="836" />
            it?<lb n="837" /> </said>
            <said who="???">&#8213;Good! said MacCann, smacking his lips. You are a reaction- <lb n="838" />
            ary then?<lb n="839" /> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;Do you think you impress me, Stephen asked, when you <lb n="840" />
            flourish your wooden sword?<lb n="841" /> </said>
            <said who="???">&#8213;Metaphors! said MacCann bluntly. Come to facts.<lb n="842" /></said> </p>
            <p> Stephen blushed and turned aside. MacCann stood his <lb n="843" />
            ground and said with hostile humour: <lb n="844" />
            <said who="???">&#8213;Minor poets, I suppose, are above such trivial questions as <lb n="845" />
            the question of universal peace.<lb n="846" /></said> </p>
            <p> Cranly raised his head and held the handball between the <lb n="847" />
            two students by way of a peaceoffering, saying: <lb n="848" />
            <said who="???">&#8213;<seg xml:lang="la">Pax super totum sanguinarium globum.</seg><lb n="849" /></said> </p>
            <p> Stephen, moving away the bystanders, jerked his shoulder <lb n="850" />
            angrily in the direction of the Czar's image, saying: <lb n="851" />
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;Keep your icon. If we must have a Jesus let us have a legit- <lb n="852" />
            imate Jesus.<lb n="853" /> </said>
            <said who="???">&#8213;By hell, that's a good one! said the gipsy student to those <lb n="854" />
            about him. That's a fine expression. I like that expression <lb n="855" />
            immensely.<lb n="856" /></said> </p>
            <p> He gulped down the spittle in his throat as if he were gulp- <lb n="857" />
            ing down the phrase and, fumbling at the peak of his tweed <lb n="858" />
            cap, turned to Stephen, saying: <lb n="859" />
            <said who="???">&#8213;Excuse me, sir, what do you mean by that expression you <lb n="860" />
            uttered just now?<lb n="861" /></said> </p>
            <p> Feeling himself jostled by the students near him, he said to <lb n="862" />
            them: <lb n="863" />
            <said who="???">&#8213;I am curious to know now what he meant by that ex- <lb n="864" />
            pression.<lb n="865" /></said> </p>
            <p> He turned again to Stephen and said in a whisper: <lb n="866" />
            <said who="???">&#8213;Do you believe in Jesus? I believe in man. Of course, I don't <lb n="867" />
            know if you believe in man. I admire you, sir. I admire the <lb n="868" />
            mind of man independent of all religions. Is that your opinion <lb n="869" />
            about the mind of Jesus?<lb n="870" /> </said>
            <said who="???">&#8213;Go on, Temple, said the stout ruddy student returning, as <lb n="871" />
            was his wont, to his first idea, that pint is waiting for you.<lb n="872" /> </said>
            <said who="???">&#8213;He thinks I'm an imbecile, Temple explained to Stephen, <lb n="873" />
            because I'm a  believer in the power of mind.<lb n="874" /></said> </p>
            <p> Cranly linked his arms into those of Stephen and his admirer <lb n="875" />
            and said: <lb n="876" />
            <said who="???">&#8213;<seg xml:lang="la">Nos ad manum ballum jocabimus.</seg><lb n="877" /></said> </p>
            <p> Stephen, in the act of being led away, caught sight of <lb n="878" />
            MacCann's flushed bluntfeatured face. <lb n="879" />
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;My signature is of no account, he said politely. You are right <lb n="880" />
            to go your way. Leave me to go mine.<lb n="881" /> </said>
            <said who="???">&#8213;Dedalus, said MacCann crisply, I believe you're a good fel- <lb n="882" />
            low but you have yet to learn the dignity of altruism and the <lb n="883" />
            responsibility of the human individual.<lb n="884" /></said> </p>
            <p> A voice said: <lb n="885" />
            <said who="???">&#8213;Intellectual crankery is better out of this movement than in <lb n="886" />
            it.<lb n="887" /></said> </p>
            <p> Stephen, recognising  the harsh tone of MacAlister's voice, <lb n="888" />
            did not turn in the direction of the voice. Cranly pushed sol- <lb n="889" />
            emnly through the throng of students, linking Stephen and <lb n="890" />
            Temple like a celebrant attended by his ministers on his way to <lb n="891" />
            the altar.<lb n="892" /> </p>
            <p> Temple bent eagerly across Cranly's breast and said: <lb n="893" />
            <said who="???">&#8213;Did you hear MacAlister what he said? That youth is jealous <lb n="894" />
            of you. Did you see that? I bet Cranly didn't see that. By hell, I <lb n="895" />
            saw that at once.<lb n="896" /></said> </p>
            <p> As they crossed the inner hall the dean of studies was in  the <lb n="897" />
            act of escaping from the student with whom he had been con- <lb n="898" />
            versing. He stood at the foot of the staircase, a foot on the <lb n="899" />
            lowest step, his threadbare  soutane gathered about him for <lb n="900" />
            the ascent with womanish care, nodding his head often and <lb n="901" />
            repeating: <lb n="902" />
            <said who="???">&#8213;Not a doubt of it, Mr Hackett! Very true! Not a doubt of it!<lb n="903" /></said> </p>
            <p> In the middle of the hall the prefect of the college sodality <lb n="904" />
            was speaking earnestly, in a soft querulous voice, with a <lb n="905" />
            boarder. As he spoke he wrinkled a little his freckled brow and <lb n="906" />
            bit, between his phrases, at a tiny bone pencil. <lb n="907" />
            <said who="???">&#8213;I hope the matric men will all come. The first arts men are <lb n="908" />
            pretty sure. Second arts too. We must make sure of the new- <lb n="909" />
            comers.<lb n="910" /></said> </p>
            <p> Temple bent again across Cranly, as they were passing <lb n="911" />
            through the doorway, and said in a swift whisper: <lb n="912" />
            <said who="???">&#8213;Do you know that he is a married man? He was a married <lb n="913" />
            man before they converted him. He has a wife and children <lb n="914" />
            somewhere. By hell, I think that's the queerest notion I ever <lb n="915" />
            heard! Eh?<lb n="916" /></said> </p>
            <p> His whisper trailed off into sly cackling laughter. The mo- <lb n="917" />
            ment they were through the doorway Cranly seized him rudely <lb n="918" />
            by the neck and shook him, saying: <lb n="919" />
            <said who="???">&#8213;You flaming floundering fool! I'll take my dying bible there <lb n="920" />
            isn't a bigger bloody ape, do you know, than you in the whole <lb n="921" />
            flaming bloody world!<lb n="922" /></said> </p>
            <p> Temple wriggled in his grip, laughing still with sly content, <lb n="923" />
            while Cranly repeated flatly at every rude shake: <lb n="924" />
            <said who="???">&#8213;A flaming flaring  bloody idiot!<lb n="925" /></said> </p>
            <p> They crossed the weedy garden together. The president, <lb n="926" />
            wrapped in a heavy loose cloak, was coming towards them <lb n="927" />
            along one of the walks, reading his office. At the end of the <lb n="928" />
            walk he halted before turning and raised his eyes. The students <lb n="929" />
            saluted, Temple fumbling as before at the peak of his cap. They <lb n="930" />
            walked forward in silence. As they neared the alley Stephen <lb n="931" />
            could hear the thuds of the players' hands and the wet smacks <lb n="932" />
            of the ball and Davin's voice crying out excitedly at each <lb n="933" />
            stroke.<lb n="934" /> </p>
            <p> The three students halted round the box on which Davin sat <lb n="935" />
            to follow the game. Temple, after a few moments, sidled across <lb n="936" />
            to Stephen and said: <lb n="937" />
            <said who="???">&#8213;Excuse me, I wanted to ask you do you believe that Jean <lb n="938" />
            Jacques Rousseau was a sincere man?<lb n="939" /></said> </p>
            <p> Stephen laughed outright. Cranly, picking up the broken <lb n="940" />
            stave of a cask from the grass at his foot, turned swiftly and <lb n="941" />
            said sternly: <lb n="942" />
            <said who="???">&#8213;Temple, I declare to the living God if you say another word, <lb n="943" />
            do you know, to anybody on any subject I'll kill you <seg xml:lang="la">super <lb n="944" />
            spottum</seg>.<lb n="945" /> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;He was like you, I fancy, said Stephen, an emotional man.<lb n="946" /> </said>
            <said who="???">&#8213;Blast him, curse him! said Cranly broadly. Don't talk to him <lb n="947" />
            at all. Sure you might as well be talking, do you know, to a <lb n="948" />
            flaming chamberpot as talking to Temple. Go home, Temple. <lb n="949" />
            For God' sake go home.<lb n="950" /> </said>
            <said who="???">&#8213;I don't care a damn about you, Cranly, answered Temple, <lb n="951" />
            moving out of reach of the uplifted stave and pointing at Ste- <lb n="952" />
            phen. He's the only man I see in this institution that has an <lb n="953" />
            individual mind.<lb n="954" /> </said>
            <said who="???">&#8213;Institution! Individual! cried Cranly. Go home, blast you, for <lb n="955" />
            you're a hopeless bloody man.<lb n="956" /> </said>
            <said who="???">&#8213;I'm an emotional man, said Temple. That's quite rightly <lb n="957" />
            expressed. And I'm proud that I'm an emotionalist.<lb n="958" /></said> </p>
            <p> He sidled out of the alley, smiling slily. Cranly watched him <lb n="959" />
            with a blank expressionless face. <lb n="960" />
            <said who="???">&#8213;Look at him! he said. Did you ever see such a go-by-the- <lb n="961" />
            wall?<lb n="962" /></said> </p>
            <p> His phrase was greeted by a strange laugh from a student <lb n="963" />
            who lounged against the wall, his peaked cap down on his eyes. <lb n="964" />
            The laugh, pitched in a high key and coming from a so muscu- <lb n="965" />
            lar frame, seemed like the whinny of an elephant. The student's <lb n="966" />
            body shook all over and, to ease his mirth, he rubbed both his <lb n="967" />
            hands delightedly over  his groins. <lb n="968" />
            <said who="???">&#8213;Lynch is awake, said Cranly.<lb n="969" /></said> </p>
            <p> Lynch, for answer, straightened himself and thrust forward <lb n="970" />
            his chest. <lb n="971" />
            <said who="???">&#8213;Lynch puts out his chest, said Stephen, as a criticism of life.<lb n="972" /></said> </p>
            <p> Lynch smote himself sonorously on the chest and said: <lb n="973" />
            <said who="???">&#8213;Who has anything to say about my girth?<lb n="974" /></said> </p>
            <p> Cranly took him at the word and the two began to tussle. <lb n="975" />
            When their faces had flushed with the struggle they drew apart, <lb n="976" />
            panting. Stephen bent down towards Davin who, intent on the <lb n="977" />
            game, had paid no heed to the talk of the others. <lb n="978" />
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;And how is my little tame goose? he asked. Did he sign too?<lb n="979" /></said> </p>
            <p> Davin nodded and said: <lb n="980" />
            <said who="???">&#8213;And you, Stevie?<lb n="981" /></said> </p>
            <p> Stephen shook his head. <lb n="982" />
            <said who="???">&#8213;You're a terrible man, Stevie, said Davin, taking the short <lb n="983" />
            pipe from his mouth. Always alone.<lb n="984" /> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;Now that you have signed the petition for universal peace, <lb n="985" />
            said Stephen, I suppose you will burn that little copybook I saw <lb n="986" />
            in your room.<lb n="987" /></said> </p>
            <p> As Davin did not answer Stephen began to quote: <lb n="988" />
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;Long pace, fianna! Right incline, fianna! Fianna, by num- <lb n="989" />
            bers, salute, one, two!<lb n="990" /> </said>
            <said who="???">&#8213;That's a different question, said Davin. I'm an Irish nation- <lb n="991" />
            alist, first and foremost. But that's you all out. You're a born <lb n="992" />
            sneerer, Stevie.<lb n="993" /> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;When you make the next rebellion with hurleysticks, said <lb n="994" />
            Stephen, and want the indispensable informer, tell me. I can <lb n="995" />
            find you a few in this college.<lb n="996" /> </said>
            <said who="???">&#8213;I can't understand you, said Davin. One time I hear you talk <lb n="997" />
            against English literature. Now you talk against the  Irish in- <lb n="998" />
            formers. What with your name and your ideas .... Are you Irish <lb n="999" />
            at all?<lb n="1000" /> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;Come with me now to the office of arms and I will show you <lb n="1001" />
            the tree of my family, said Stephen.<lb n="1002" /> </said>
            <said who="???">&#8213;Then be one of us, said Davin. Why don't you learn Irish? <lb n="1003" />
            Why did you drop out of the league class after the first lesson?<lb n="1004" /> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;You know one reason why, answered Stephen.<lb n="1005" /></said> </p>
            <p> Davin tossed his head and laughed. <lb n="1006" />
            <said who="???">&#8213;O, come now, he said. Is it on account of that certain young <lb n="1007" />
            lady and Father Moran? But that's all in your own mind, <lb n="1008" />
            Stevie. They were only talking and laughing.<lb n="1009" /></said> </p>
            <p> Stephen paused and laid a friendly hand upon Davin's <lb n="1010" />
            shoulder. <lb n="1011" />
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;Do you remember, he said, when we knew each other first. <lb n="1012" />
            The first morning we met you asked me to show you the <lb n="1013" />
            way to the matriculation class, putting a very strong stress on <lb n="1014" />
            the first syllable. You remember? Then you used to address the <lb n="1015" />
            jesuits as father, you remember? I ask myself about you: <emph>Is <lb n="1016" />
            he as innocent as his speech?</emph><lb n="1017" /> </said>
            <said who="???">&#8213;I'm a simple person, said Davin. You know that. When you <lb n="1018" />
            told me that night in Harcourt Street those things about your <lb n="1019" />
            private life, honest to God, Stevie, I was not able to eat my <lb n="1020" />
            dinner. I was quite bad. I was awake a long time that night. <lb n="1021" />
            Why did you tell me those things?<lb n="1022" /> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;Thanks, said Stephen. You mean I am a monster.<lb n="1023" /> </said>
            <said who="???">&#8213;No, said Davin, but I wish you had not told me.<lb n="1024" /></said> </p>
            <p> A tide began to surge beneath the calm surface of Stephen's <lb n="1025" />
            friendliness. <lb n="1026" />
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;This race and this country and this life produced me, he <lb n="1027" />
            said. I shall express myself as I am.<lb n="1028" /> </said>
            <said who="???">&#8213;Try to be one of us, repeated Davin. In your heart you are an <lb n="1029" />
            Irishman but your pride is too powerful.<lb n="1030" /> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;My ancestors threw off their language and took on another, <lb n="1031" />
            Stephen said. They allowed a handful of foreigners to subject <lb n="1032" />
            them. Do you fancy I am going to pay in my own life and <lb n="1033" />
            person debts they made? What for?<lb n="1034" /> </said>
            <said who="???">&#8213;For our freedom, said Davin.<lb n="1035" /> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;No honourable and sincere man, said Stephen, has given up <lb n="1036" />
            to you his life and his youth and his affections from the days of <lb n="1037" />
            Tone to those of Parnell but you sold him to the enemy or <lb n="1038" />
            failed him in need or reviled him and left him for another. And <lb n="1039" />
            you invite me to be one of you. I'd see you damned first.<lb n="1040" /> </said>
            <said who="???">&#8213;They died for their ideals, Stevie, said Davin. Our day will <lb n="1041" />
            come yet, believe me.<lb n="1042" /></said> </p>
            <p> Stephen, following his own thought, was silent for an in- <lb n="1043" />
            stant. <lb n="1044" />
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;The soul is born, he said vaguely, first in those moments I <lb n="1045" />
            told you of. It has a slow and dark birth, more mysterious than <lb n="1046" />
            the birth of the body. When the soul of a man is born in this <lb n="1047" />
            country there are nets flung at it to hold it back from flight. <lb n="1048" />
            You talk to me of nationality, language, religion. I shall try to <lb n="1049" />
            fly by those nets.<lb n="1050" /></said> </p>
            <p> Davin knocked the ashes from his pipe. <lb n="1051" />
            <said who="???">&#8213;Too deep for me, Stevie, he said. But a man's country comes <lb n="1052" />
            first. Ireland first, Stevie. You can be a poet or a mystic after.<lb n="1053" /> </said>
            <said who="???">&#8213;Do you know what Ireland is? asked Stephen with cold <lb n="1054" />
            violence. Ireland is the old sow that eats her farrow.<lb n="1055" /></said> </p>
            <p> Davin rose from his box and went towards the players, <lb n="1056" />
            shaking his head sadly. But in a moment his sadness left him <lb n="1057" />
            and he was hotly disputing with Cranly and the two players <lb n="1058" />
            who had finished their game. A match of four was arranged, <lb n="1059" />
            Cranly insisting, however, that his ball should be used. He let it <lb n="1060" />
            rebound twice or thrice to his hand and then struck it strongly <lb n="1061" />
            and swiftly towards the base of the alley, exclaiming in answer <lb n="1062" />
            to its thud: <lb n="1063" />
            <said who="???">&#8213;Your soul!<lb n="1064" /></said> </p>
            <p> Stephen stood with Lynch till the score began to rise. Then <lb n="1065" />
            he plucked him by the sleeve to come away. Lynch obeyed, <lb n="1066" />
            saying: <lb n="1067" />
            <said who="???">&#8213;Let us eke go, as Cranly has it.<lb n="1068" /></said> </p>
            <p> Stephen smiled at this sidethrust. They passed back through <lb n="1069" />
            the garden and out through the hall where the doddering porter <lb n="1070" />
            was pinning up a notice in the frame. At the foot of the steps <lb n="1071" />
            they halted and Stephen took a packet of cigarettes from his <lb n="1072" />
            pocket and offered it to his companion. <lb n="1073" />
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;I know you are poor, he said.<lb n="1074" /> </said>
            <said who="???">&#8213;Damn your yellow insolence, answered Lynch.<lb n="1075" /></said> </p>
            <p> This second proof of Lynch's culture made Stephen smile <lb n="1076" />
            again. <lb n="1077" />
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;It was a great day for European culture, he said, when you <lb n="1078" />
            made up your mind to swear in yellow.<lb n="1079" /></said> </p>
            <p> They lit their cigarettes and turned to the right. After a <lb n="1080" />
            pause Stephen began: <lb n="1081" />
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;Aristotle has not defined pity and terror. I have. I say ...<lb n="1082" /></said> </p>
            <p> Lynch halted and said bluntly: <lb n="1083" />
            <said who="???">&#8213;Stop! I won't listen! I am sick. I was out last night on a <lb n="1084" />
            yellow drunk with Horan and Goggins.<lb n="1085" /></said> </p>
            <p> Stephen went on: <lb n="1086" />
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;Pity is the feeling which arrests the mind in the presence of <lb n="1087" />
            whatsoever is grave and constant in human sufferings and <lb n="1088" />
            unites it with the human sufferer.  Terror is the feeling which <lb n="1089" />
            arrests the mind in the presence of whatsoever is grave and <lb n="1090" />
            constant in human sufferings and unites it with the secret <lb n="1091" />
            cause.<lb n="1092" /> </said>
            <said who="???">&#8213;Repeat, said Lynch.<lb n="1093" /></said> </p>
            <p> Stephen repeated the definitions slowly. <lb n="1094" />
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;A girl got into a hansom a few days ago, he went on, in <place><location><geo>51.507351 -0.127758</geo></location> <lb n="1095" />
            <placeName>London</placeName></place>. She was on her way to meet her mother whom she <lb n="1096" />
            had not seen for many years. At the corner of a street the shaft <lb n="1097" />
            of a lorry shivered the window of the hansom in the shape of a <lb n="1098" />
            star. A long fine needle of the shivered glass pierced her heart. <lb n="1099" />
            She died on the instant. The reporter called it a tragic death. It <lb n="1100" />
            is not. It is remote from terror and pity according to the terms <lb n="1101" />
            of my definitions.<lb n="1102" /> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">The tragic emotion, in fact, is a face looking two ways, <lb n="1103" />
            towards terror and towards pity, both of which are phases of <lb n="1104" />
            it. You see I use the word <emph>arrest</emph>. I mean that the tragic emotion <lb n="1105" />
            is static. Or rather the dramatic emotion is. The feelings ex- <lb n="1106" />
            cited by improper art are kinetic, desire or loathing. Desire <lb n="1107" />
            urges us to possess, to go to something, loathing  urges us to <lb n="1108" />
            abandon, to go from something. These are kinetic emotions. <lb n="1109" />
            The arts which excite them, pornographical or didactic, are <lb n="1110" />
            therefore improper arts. The esthetic emotion (I use the general <lb n="1111" />
            term) is therefore static. The mind is arrested and raised above <lb n="1112" />
            desire and loathing.<lb n="1113" /> </said>
            <said who="???">&#8213;You say that art must not excite desire, said Lynch. I told <lb n="1114" />
            you that one day I wrote my name in pencil on the backside of <lb n="1115" />
            the Venus of Praxiteles in the <place><location><geo>53.339706 -6.252188</geo></location><placeName>Museum</placeName></place>. Was that not desire?<lb n="1116" /> </said>
            <said who="???">&#8213;I speak of normal natures, said Stephen. You also told me <lb n="1117" />
            that when you were a boy in that charming carmelite school <lb n="1118" />
            you ate pieces of dried cowdung.<lb n="1119" /></said> </p>
            <p> Lynch broke again into a whinny of laughter and again <lb n="1120" />
            rubbed both his hands over his groins but without taking them <lb n="1121" />
            from his pockets. <lb n="1122" />
            <said who="???">&#8213;O I did! I did! he cried.<lb n="1123" /></said> </p>
            <p> Stephen turned towards his companion and looked at him <lb n="1124" />
            for a moment boldly in the eyes. Lynch, recovering from his <lb n="1125" />
            laughter, answered his look from his humbled eyes. The long <lb n="1126" />
            slender flattened skull beneath the long pointed cap brought <lb n="1127" />
            before Stephen's mind the image of a hooded reptile. The eyes, <lb n="1128" />
            too, were reptilelike in glint and gaze. Yet at that instant, <lb n="1129" />
            humbled and alert in their look, they were lit by one tiny <lb n="1130" />
            human point, the window of a shrivelled soul, poignant and <lb n="1131" />
            selfembittered. <lb n="1132" />
            <said who="???">&#8213;As for that, Stephen said in polite parenthesis, we are all <lb n="1133" />
            animals. I also am an animal.<lb n="1134" /> </said>
            <said who="???">&#8213;You are, said Lynch.<lb n="1135" /> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">"&gt;&#8213;But we are just now in a mental world, Stephen continued. <lb n="1136" />
            The desire and loathing excited by improper esthetic means are <lb n="1137" />
            really not esthetic emotions not only because they are kinetic <lb n="1138" />
            in character but also because they are not more than physical. <lb n="1139" />
            Our flesh shrinks from what it dreads and responds to the <lb n="1140" />
            stimulus of what it desires by a purely reflex action of the nerv- <lb n="1141" />
            ous system. Our eyelid closes before we are aware that the fly is <lb n="1142" />
            about to enter our eye.<lb n="1143" /> </said>
            <said who="???">&#8213;Not always, said Lynch critically.<lb n="1144" /> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">"&gt;&#8213;In the same way, said Stephen, your flesh responded to the <lb n="1145" />
            stimulus of a naked statue but it was, I say, simply a reflex <lb n="1146" />
            action of the nerves. Beauty expressed by the artist cannot <lb n="1147" />
            awaken in us an emotion which is kinetic or a sensation which <lb n="1148" />
            is purely physical. It awakens, or ought to awaken, or induces, <lb n="1149" />
            or ought to induce, an esthetic stasis, an ideal pity or an ideal <lb n="1150" />
            terror, a stasis called forth, prolonged and at last dissolved by <lb n="1151" />
            what I call the rhythm of beauty.<lb n="1152" /> </said>
            <said who="???">&#8213;What is that exactly? asked Lynch.<lb n="1153" /> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;Rhythm, said Stephen, is the first formal esthetic relation of <lb n="1154" />
            part to part in any esthetic whole or of an esthetic whole to its <lb n="1155" />
            part or parts or of any part to the esthetic whole of which it is a <lb n="1156" />
            part.<lb n="1157" /> </said>
            <said who="???">&#8213;If that is rhythm, said Lynch, let me hear what you call <lb n="1158" />
            beauty: and, please remember, though I did eat a cake of cow- <lb n="1159" />
            dung once, that I admire only beauty.<lb n="1160" /></said> </p>
            <p> Stephen raised his cap as if in greeting. Then,  blushing <lb n="1161" />
            slightly, he laid his hand on Lynch's thick tweed sleeve. <lb n="1162" />
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;We are right, he said, and the others are wrong. To speak of <lb n="1163" />
            these things and to try to understand their nature and, having <lb n="1164" />
            understood it, to try slowly and humbly and constantly to <lb n="1165" />
            express, to press out again, from the gross earth or what it <lb n="1166" />
            brings forth, from sound and shape and colour which are the <lb n="1167" />
            prison gates of our soul, an image of the beauty we have come <lb n="1168" />
            to understand &#8211; that is art.<lb n="1169" /></said> </p>
            <p> They had reached the <place><location><geo>53.342399 -6.238434</geo></location><placeName>canal bridge</placeName></place> and, turning from their <lb n="1170" />
            course, went on by the trees. A crude grey light, mirrored in the <lb n="1171" />
            sluggish water, and a smell of wet branches over their heads <lb n="1172" />
            seemed to war against the course of Stephen's thought. <lb n="1173" />
            <said who="???">&#8213;But you have not answered my question, said Lynch. What <lb n="1174" />
            is art? What is the beauty it expresses?<lb n="1175" /> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;That was the first definition I gave you, you sleepyheaded <lb n="1176" />
            wretch, said Stephen, when I began to try to think out the <lb n="1177" />
            matter for myself. Do you remember the night? Cranly lost his <lb n="1178" />
            temper and began to talk about Wicklow bacon.<lb n="1179" /> </said>
            <said who="???">&#8213;I remember, said Lynch. He told us about them flaming fat <lb n="1180" />
            devils of pigs.<lb n="1181" /> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;Art, said Stephen, is the human disposition of sensible or <lb n="1182" />
            intelligible matter for an esthetic end. You remember the pigs <lb n="1183" />
            and forget that. You are a distressing pair, you and Cranly.<lb n="1184" /></said> </p>
            <p> Lynch made a grimace at the raw grey sky and said: <lb n="1185" />
            <said who="???">&#8213;If I am to listen to your esthetic philosophy give me at least <lb n="1186" />
            another cigarette. I don't care about it. I don't even care about <lb n="1187" />
            women. Damn you and damn everything. I want a job of five <lb n="1188" />
            hundred a year. You can't get me one.<lb n="1189" /></said> </p>
            <p> Stephen handed him the packet of cigarettes. Lynch took the <lb n="1190" />
            last one that remained, saying simply: <lb n="1191" />
            <said who="???">&#8213;Proceed!<lb n="1192" /> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;Aquinas, said Stephen, says that is beautiful the apprehen- <lb n="1193" />
            sion of which pleases.<lb n="1194" /></said> </p>
            <p> Lynch nodded. <lb n="1195" />
            <said who="???">&#8213;I remember that, he said. <seg xml:lang="la">Pulcra sunt quae visa placent.</seg><lb n="1196" /> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;He uses the word <seg xml:lang="la">visa</seg>, said Stephen, to cover esthetic appre- <lb n="1197" />
            hension of all kinds, whether through sight or hearing or <lb n="1198" />
            through any other avenue of apprehension. This word, though <lb n="1199" />
            it is vague, is clear enough to keep away good and evil which <lb n="1200" />
            excite desire and loathing. It means certainly a stasis and not a <lb n="1201" />
            kinesis. How about the true? It produces also a stasis of the <lb n="1202" />
            mind. You would not write your name in pencil across the <lb n="1203" />
            hypothenuse of a rightangled triangle.<lb n="1204" /> </said>
            <said who="???">&#8213;No, said Lynch. Give me the hypothenuse of the Venus of <lb n="1205" />
            Praxiteles.<lb n="1206" /> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;Static therefore, said Stephen. Plato, I believe, said that <lb n="1207" />
            beauty is the splendour of truth. I don't think that it has a <lb n="1208" />
            meaning but the true and the beautiful are akin. Truth is beheld <lb n="1209" />
            by the intellect which is appeased by the most satisfying <lb n="1210" />
            relations of the intelligible:  beauty is beheld by the imagination <lb n="1211" />
            which is appeased by the most satisfying relations of the sen- <lb n="1212" />
            sible. The first step in the direction of truth is to understand the <lb n="1213" />
            frame and scope of the intellect itself, to comprehend the act <lb n="1214" />
            itself of intellection. Aristotle's entire system of philosophy <lb n="1215" />
            rests upon his book of psychology and that, I think, rests on his <lb n="1216" />
            statement that the same attribute cannot at the same time and <lb n="1217" />
            in the same connection belong to and not belong to the same <lb n="1218" />
            subject. The first step in the direction of beauty is to under- <lb n="1219" />
            stand the frame and scope of the imagination, to comprehend <lb n="1220" />
            the act itself of esthetic apprehension. Is that clear?<lb n="1221" /> </said>
            <said who="???">&#8213;But what is beauty? asked Lynch impatiently. Out with an- <lb n="1222" />
            other definition. Something we see and like! Is that the best you <lb n="1223" />
            and Aquinas can do?<lb n="1224" /> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;Let us take woman, said Stephen.<lb n="1225" /> </said>
            <said who="???">&#8213;Let us take her! said Lynch fervently.<lb n="1226" /> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;The Greek, the Turk, the Chinese, the Copt, the Hottentot,<lb n="1227" /> </said>
            said Stephen, <said who="Stephen Dedalus">all admire a different type of female beauty. That <lb n="1228" />
            seems to be a maze out of which we cannot escape. I see <lb n="1229" />
            however two ways out. One is this hypothesis: that every physi- <lb n="1230" />
            cal quality admired by men in women is in direct connection <lb n="1231" />
            with the manifold functions of women for the propagation of <lb n="1232" />
            the species. It may be so. The world, it seems, is drearier than <lb n="1233" />
            even you, Lynch, imagined. For my part I dislike that way out. <lb n="1234" />
            It leads to eugenics rather than to esthetic. It leads you out of <lb n="1235" />
            the maze into a new gaudy lectureroom where MacCann, with <lb n="1236" />
            one hand on <emph>The Origin of Species</emph> and the other hand on the <lb n="1237" />
            new testament, tells you that you admired the great flanks of <lb n="1238" />
            Venus because you felt that she would bear you burly offspring <lb n="1239" />
            and admired her great breasts because you felt that she would <lb n="1240" />
            give good milk to her children and yours.<lb n="1241" /> </said>
            <said who="???">&#8213;Then MacCann is a sulphuryellow liar, said Lynch energeti- <lb n="1242" />
            cally.<lb n="1243" /> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;There remains another way out, said Stephen laughing.<lb n="1244" /> </said>
            <said who="???">&#8213;To wit? said Lynch.<lb n="1245" /> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;This hypothesis, Stephen began.<lb n="1246" /></said> </p>
            <p> A long dray laden with old iron came round the corner of <lb n="1247" />
            <place><location><geo>53.339029 -6.241523</geo></location><placeName>sir Patrick Dun's</placeName></place> hospital covering the end of Stephen's speech <lb n="1248" />
            with the harsh roar of jangled and rattling metal. Lynch closed <lb n="1249" />
            his ears and gave out oath after oath till the dray had passed. <lb n="1250" />
            Then he turned on his heel rudely. Stephen turned also and <lb n="1251" />
            waited for a few moments till his companion's illhumour had <lb n="1252" />
            had its vent. <lb n="1253" />
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;This hypothesis, Stephen repeated, is the other way out: <lb n="1254" />
            that, though the same object may not seem beautiful to all <lb n="1255" />
            people, all people who admire a beautiful object find in it <lb n="1256" />
            certain relations which satisfy and coincide with the stages <lb n="1257" />
            themselves of all esthetic apprehension. These relations of the <lb n="1258" />
            sensible, visible to you through one form and to me through <lb n="1259" />
            another, must be therefore the necessary qualities of beauty. <lb n="1260" />
            Now, we can return to our old friend saint Thomas for another <lb n="1261" />
            pennyworth of wisdom.<lb n="1262" /></said> </p>
            <p> Lynch laughed. <lb n="1263" />
            <said who="???">&#8213;It amuses me vastly, he said, to hear you quoting him time <lb n="1264" />
            after time like a jolly round friar. Are you laughing in your <lb n="1265" />
            sleeve?<lb n="1266" /> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;MacAlister, answered Stephen, would call my esthetic the- <lb n="1267" />
            ory applied Aquinas. So far as this side of esthetic philosophy <lb n="1268" />
            extends Aquinas will carry me all along the line. When we <lb n="1269" />
            come to the phenomenon of artistic conception, artistic gesta- <lb n="1270" />
            tion and artistic reproduction I require a new terminology and <lb n="1271" />
            a new personal experience.<lb n="1272" /> </said>
            <said who="Lynch">Of course, said Lynch. After all Aquinas, in spite of his <lb n="1273" />
            intellect, was exactly a good round  friar. But you will tell me <lb n="1274" />
            about the new personal experience and new terminology some <lb n="1275" />
            other day. Hurry up and finish the first part.<lb n="1276" /> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;Who knows? said Stephen smiling. Perhaps Aquinas would <lb n="1277" />
            understand me better than you. He was a poet himself. He <lb n="1278" />
            wrote a hymn for Maundy Thursday. It begins with the words <lb n="1279" />
            <seg xml:lang="la">Pange lingua gloriosi</seg>. They say it is the highest glory of the <lb n="1280" />
            hymnal. It is an intricate and soothing hymn.  I like it: but there <lb n="1281" />
            is no hymn that can be put beside that mournful and majestic <lb n="1282" />
            processional song, the <seg xml:lang="la">Vexilla Regis</seg> of <seg xml:lang="la">Venantius Fortunatus</seg>.<lb n="1283" /></said> </p>
            <p> Lynch began to sing softly and solemnly in a deep bass <lb n="1284" />
            voice: <lb n="1285" />
            <lg type="song" xml:lang="la">
              <l>Impleta sunt quae concinit</l> <lb n="1286" />

            </lg>
            <said who="???">&#8213;That's great! he said, well pleased. Great music!<lb n="1290" /></said> </p>
            <p> They turned into <place><location><geo>53.338573 -6.243389</geo></location><placeName>Lower Mount Street</placeName></place>. A few steps from the <lb n="1291" />
            corner a fat young man, wearing a silk neckcloth, saluted them <lb n="1292" />
            and stopped. <lb n="1293" />
            <said who="???">&#8213;Did you hear the results of the exams? he asked. Griffin was <lb n="1294" />
            plucked. Halpin and O'Flynn are through the home civil. <lb n="1295" />
            Moonan got fifth place in the Indian. O'Shaughenessy got four- <lb n="1296" />
            teenth. The Irish fellows in Clarke's gave them a feed last night. <lb n="1297" />
            They all ate curry.<lb n="1298" /></said> </p>
            <p> His pallid bloated face expressed benevolent malice and, as <lb n="1299" />
            he had advanced through his tidings of success, his small <lb n="1300" />
            fatencircled eyes vanished out of sight and his weak wheezing <lb n="1301" />
            voice out of hearing.<lb n="1302" /> </p>
            <p> In reply to a question of Stephen's his eyes and his voice <lb n="1303" />
            came forth again from their lurkingplaces. <lb n="1304" />
            <said who="???">&#8213;Yes, MacCullagh and I, he said. He's taking pure mathemat- <lb n="1305" />
            ics and I'm taking constitutional history. There are twenty <lb n="1306" />
            subjects. I'm taking botany too. You know I'm a member of the <lb n="1307" />
            field club.<lb n="1308" /></said> </p>
            <p> He drew back from the other two in a stately fashion and <lb n="1309" />
            placed a plump woollengloved hand on his breast from which <lb n="1310" />
            muttered wheezing laughter at once broke forth. <lb n="1311" />
            <said who="???">&#8213;Bring us a few turnips and onions the next time you go out <lb n="1312" />
            said Stephen drily, to make a stew.<lb n="1313" /></said> </p>
            <p> The fat student laughed indulgently and said: <lb n="1314" />
            <said who="???">&#8213;We are all  highly respectable people in the field club. Last <lb n="1315" />
            Saturday we went out to <place><location><geo>52.957720 -6.354370</geo></location><placeName>Glenmalure</placeName></place>, seven of us.<lb n="1316" /> </said>
            <said who="???">&#8213;With women, Donovan? said Lynch.<lb n="1317" /></said> </p>
            <p> Donovan again laid his hand on his chest and said: <lb n="1318" />
            <said who="???">&#8213;Our end is the acquisition of knowledge.<lb n="1319" /></said> </p>
            <p> Then he said quickly: <lb n="1320" />
            <said who="???">&#8213;I hear you are writing some essay about esthetics.<lb n="1321" /></said> </p>
            <p> Stephen made a vague gesture of denial. <lb n="1322" />
            <said who="???">&#8213;Goethe and Lessing, said Donovan, have written a lot on <lb n="1323" />
            that subject, the classical school and the romantic school and <lb n="1324" />
            all that. The <emph>Laocoon</emph> interested me very much when I read it. <lb n="1325" />
            Of course it is idealistic, German, ultraprofound.<lb n="1326" /></said> </p>
            <p> Neither of the others spoke. Donovan took leave of them <lb n="1327" />
            urbanely. <lb n="1328" />
            <said who="???">&#8213;I must go, he said softly and benevolently. I have a strong <lb n="1329" />
            suspicion, amounting almost to a conviction, that my sister <lb n="1330" />
            intended to make pancakes today for the dinner of the Don- <lb n="1331" />
            ovan family.<lb n="1332" /> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;Goodbye, Stephen said in his wake. Don't forget the turnips <lb n="1333" />
            for me and my mate.<lb n="1334" /></said> </p>
            <p> Lynch gazed after him, his lip curling in slow scorn till his <lb n="1335" />
            face resembled a devil's mask: <lb n="1336" />
            <said who="???">&#8213;To think that that yellow pancakeeating excrement can get a <lb n="1337" />
            good job, he said at length, and I have to smoke cheap ciga- <lb n="1338" />
            rettes!<lb n="1339" /></said> </p>
            <p> They turned their faces towards <place><location><geo>53.339658 -6.249165</geo></location><placeName>Merrion Square</placeName></place> and went <lb n="1340" />
            on for a little in silence. <lb n="1341" />
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;To finish what I was saying about beauty, said Stephen, the <lb n="1342" />
            most satisfying relations of the sensible must therefore corre- <lb n="1343" />
            spond to the necessary phases of artistic apprehension. Find <lb n="1344" />
            these and you find the qualities of universal beauty. Aquinas <lb n="1345" />
            says: <seg xml:lang="la">ad pulcritudinem tria requiruntur, integritas, consonantia, <lb n="1346" />
            claritas</seg>. I translate it so: <emph>Three things are needed for beauty, <lb n="1347" />
            wholeness, harmony and radiance</emph>. Do these correspond to the <lb n="1348" />
            phases of apprehension? Are you following?<lb n="1349" /> </said>
            <said who="???">&#8213;Of course, I am, said Lynch. If you think I have an excre- <lb n="1350" />
            mentitious intelligence run after Donovan and ask him to listen <lb n="1351" />
            to you.<lb n="1352" /></said> </p>
            <p> Stephen pointed to a basket which a butcher's boy had slung <lb n="1353" />
            inverted on his head. <lb n="1354" />
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;Look at that basket, he said.<lb n="1355" /> </said>
            <said who="???">&#8213;I see it, said Lynch.<lb n="1356" /> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;In order to see that basket, said Stephen, your mind first of <lb n="1357" />
            all separates the basket from the rest of the visible universe <lb n="1358" />
            which is not the basket. The first phase of apprehension is a <lb n="1359" />
            bounding line drawn about the object to be apprehended. An <lb n="1360" />
            esthetic image is presented to us either in space or in time. <lb n="1361" />
            What is audible is presented in time, what is visible is presented <lb n="1362" />
            in space. But temporal or spatial the esthetic image is first <lb n="1363" />
            luminously apprehended as selfbounded and selfcontained <lb n="1364" />
            upon the immeasurable background of space or time which is <lb n="1365" />
            not it. You apprehend it as <emph>one</emph> thing. You see it as one whole. <lb n="1366" />
            You apprehend its wholeness. That is <seg xml:lang="la">integritas</seg>.<lb n="1367" /> </said>
            <said who="???">&#8213;Bull's eye! said Lynch laughing. Go on.<lb n="1368" /> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;Then, said Stephen, you pass from point to point, led by its <lb n="1369" />
            formal lines; you apprehend it as balanced part against part <lb n="1370" />
            within its limits; you feel the rhythm of its structure. In other <lb n="1371" />
            words the synthesis of immediate perception is followed by the <lb n="1372" />
            analysis of apprehension. Having first felt that it is <emph>one</emph> thing <lb n="1373" />
            you feel now that it is a <emph>thing</emph>. You apprehend it as complex, <lb n="1374" />
            multiple, divisible, separable, made up of its parts, the result of <lb n="1375" />
            its parts and their sum, harmonious. That is <seg xml:lang="la">consonantia</seg>.<lb n="1376" /> </said>
            <said who="???">&#8213;Bull's eye again! said Lynch wittily. Tell me now what is <lb n="1377" />
            <seg xml:lang="la">claritas</seg> and you win the cigar.<lb n="1378" /> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;The connotation of the word, Stephen said, is rather vague. <lb n="1379" />
            Aquinas uses a term which seems to be inexact. It baffled me <lb n="1380" />
            for a long time. It would lead you to believe that he had in <lb n="1381" />
            mind symbolism or idealism, the supreme quality of beauty <lb n="1382" />
            being a light from some other world, the idea of which the <lb n="1383" />
            matter is but the shadow, the reality of which it is but the <lb n="1384" />
            symbol. I thought he might mean that <seg xml:lang="la">claritas</seg> is the artistic <lb n="1385" />
            discovery and representation of the divine purpose in anything <lb n="1386" />
            or a force of generalisation which would make the esthetic <lb n="1387" />
            image a universal one, make it outshine its proper conditions. <lb n="1388" />
            But that is literary talk. I understand it so. When you have <lb n="1389" />
            apprehended that basket as one thing and have then  analysed it <lb n="1390" />
            according to its form and apprehended it as a thing you make <lb n="1391" />
            the only synthesis which is logically and esthetically permiss- <lb n="1392" />
            ible. You see that it is that thing which it is and no other thing. <lb n="1393" />
            The radiance of which he speaks is the scholastic <seg xml:lang="la">quidditas</seg>, the <lb n="1394" />
            <emph>whatness</emph> of a thing. This supreme quality is felt by the artist <lb n="1395" />
            when the esthetic image is first conceived in his imagination. <lb n="1396" />
            The mind in that mysterious instant Shelley likened beautifully <lb n="1397" />
            to a fading coal. The instant wherein that supreme quality of <lb n="1398" />
            beauty, the clear radiance of the esthetic image, is apprehended <lb n="1399" />
            luminously by the mind which has been arrested by its whole- <lb n="1400" />
            ness and fascinated by its harmony is the luminous silent stasis <lb n="1401" />
            of esthetic pleasure, a spiritual state very like to that cardiac <lb n="1402" />
            condition which the Italian physiologist Luigi Galvani, using a <lb n="1403" />
            phrase almost as beautiful as Shelley's, called the enchantment <lb n="1404" />
            of the heart.<lb n="1405" /></said> </p>
            <p> Stephen paused and, though his companion did not speak, <lb n="1406" />
            felt that his words had called up around them a thoughten- <lb n="1407" />
            chanted silence. <lb n="1408" />
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;What I have said, he began again, refers to beauty in the <lb n="1409" />
            wider sense of the word, in the sense which the word has in the <lb n="1410" />
            literary tradition. In the marketplace it has another sense. <lb n="1411" />
            When we speak of beauty in the second sense of the term our <lb n="1412" />
            judgment is influenced in the first place by the art itself and by <lb n="1413" />
            the form of that art. The image, it is clear, must be set between <lb n="1414" />
            the mind or senses of the  artist himself and the mind or senses <lb n="1415" />
            of others. If you bear this in memory you will see that art <lb n="1416" />
            necessarily divides itself into three forms progressing from one <lb n="1417" />
            to the next. These forms are: the lyrical form, the form wherein <lb n="1418" />
            the artist presents his image in immediate relation to himself; <lb n="1419" />
            the epical form, the form wherein he presents his image in <lb n="1420" />
            mediate relation to himself and to others; the dramatic form, <lb n="1421" />
            the form wherein he presents his image in immediate relation to <lb n="1422" />
            others.<lb n="1423" /> </said>
            <said who="???">&#8213;That you told me a few nights ago, said Lynch, and we <lb n="1424" />
            began the famous discussion.<lb n="1425" /> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;I have a book at home, said Stephen, in which I have written <lb n="1426" />
            down questions which are more amusing than yours were. In <lb n="1427" />
            finding the answers to them I found the theory of esthetic <lb n="1428" />
            which I am trying to explain. Here are some questions I set <lb n="1429" />
            myself: <emph>Is a chair finely made tragic or comic? Is the portrait of <lb n="1430" />
            Mona Lisa good if I desire to see it? Is the bust of sir Philip <lb n="1431" />
            Crampton lyrical, epical or dramatic? Can excrement or a child <lb n="1432" />
            or a louse be a work of art? If not, why not?</emph><lb n="1433" /> </said>
            <said who="???">&#8213;Why not, indeed? said Lynch laughing.<lb n="1434" /> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus"><emph>If a man hacking in fury at a block of wood</emph>, Stephen con- <lb n="1435" />
            tinued, <emph>make there an image &gt;of a cow is that image a work of <lb n="1436" />
            &gt;art? If not, why not?</emph><lb n="1437" /> </said>
            <said who="???">&#8213;That's a lovely one, said  Lynch laughing again. That has the <lb n="1438" />
            true scholastic stink.<lb n="1439" /> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;Lessing, said Stephen, should not have taken a group of <lb n="1440" />
            statues to write of. The art, being inferior, does not present the <lb n="1441" />
            forms I spoke of distinguished clearly one from another. Even <lb n="1442" />
            in literature, the highest and most spiritual art, the forms are <lb n="1443" />
            often confused. The lyrical form is in fact the simplest verbal <lb n="1444" />
            vesture of an instant of emotion, a rhythmical cry such as ages <lb n="1445" />
            ago cheered on the man who pulled at the oar or dragged <lb n="1446" />
            stones up a slope. He who utters it is more conscious of the <lb n="1447" />
            instant of emotion than of himself as feeling emotion. The <lb n="1448" />
            simplest epical form is seen emerging out of lyrical literature <lb n="1449" />
            when the artist prolongs and broods upon himself as the centre <lb n="1450" />
            of an epical event and this form progresses till the centre of <lb n="1451" />
            emotional gravity is equidistant from the artist himself and <lb n="1452" />
            from others. The narrative is no longer purely personal. The <lb n="1453" />
            personality of the artist passes into the narration itself, flowing <lb n="1454" />
            round and round the persons and the action like a vital sea. <lb n="1455" />
            This progress you will see easily in that old English ballad <lb n="1456" />
            <emph>Turpin Hero</emph> which begins in the first person and ends in the <lb n="1457" />
            third person. The dramatic form is reached when the vitality <lb n="1458" />
            which has flowed and eddied round each person fills every <lb n="1459" />
            person with such vital force that he or she assumes a proper <lb n="1460" />
            and intangible esthetic life. The personality of the artist at first <lb n="1461" />
            a cry or a cadence or a mood and then a fluid and lambent <lb n="1462" />
            narrative finally refines itself out of existence, impersonalises <lb n="1463" />
            itself, so to speak. The esthetic image in the dramatic form is <lb n="1464" />
            life purified in and reprojected from the human imagination. <lb n="1465" />
            The mystery of esthetic like that of material creation is accom- <lb n="1466" />
            plished. The artist, like the God of the creation, remains within <lb n="1467" />
            or behind or beyond or above his handiwork, invisible, refined <lb n="1468" />
            out of existence, indifferent, paring his fingernails.<lb n="1469" /> </said>
            <said who="???">&#8213;Trying to refine them also out of existence, said Lynch.<lb n="1470" /></said> </p>
            <p> A fine rain began to fall from the high veiled sky and they <lb n="1471" />
            turned into the duke's lawn to reach <place><location><geo>53.341522 -6.254893</geo></location><placeName>the national library</placeName></place> before <lb n="1472" />
            the shower came. <lb n="1473" />
            <said who="???">&#8213;What do you mean, Lynch asked surlily, by prating about <lb n="1474" />
            beauty and the imagination in this miserable Godforsaken is- <lb n="1475" />
            land? No wonder the artist retired within or behind his handi- <lb n="1476" />
            work after having perpetrated this country.<lb n="1477" /></said> </p>
            <p> The rain fell faster. When they passed through the passage <lb n="1478" />
            beside<place><location><geo>53.340762 -6.258382</geo></location><placeName>Kildare house</placeName></place> they found many students sheltering un- <lb n="1479" />
            der the arcade of the library. Cranly leaning against a pillar <lb n="1480" />
            was picking his teeth with a sharpened match, listening to some <lb n="1481" />
            companions. Some girls stood near the entrance door. Lynch <lb n="1482" />
            whispered to Stephen: <lb n="1483" />
            <said who="???">&#8213;Your beloved is  here.<lb n="1484" /></said> </p>
            <p> Stephen took his place silently on the step below the group <lb n="1485" />
            of students, heedless of the rain which fell fast, turning his eyes <lb n="1486" />
            towards her  from time to time. She too stood silently among <lb n="1487" />
            her companions. She has no priest to flirt with, he thought with <lb n="1488" />
            conscious bitterness, remembering how he had seen her last. <lb n="1489" />
            Lynch was right. His mind, emptied of theory and courage, <lb n="1490" />
            lapsed back into a listless peace.<lb n="1491" /> </p>
            <p> He heard the students talking among themselves. They <lb n="1492" />
            spoke of two friends who had passed the final medical exam- <lb n="1493" />
            ination, of the chances of getting places on ocean liners, of <lb n="1494" />
            poor and rich practices. <lb n="1495" />
            <said who="???">&#8213;That's all a  bubble. An Irish country practice is better.<lb n="1496" /> </said>

            <p> Their voices reached his ears as if from a distance in inter- <lb n="1509" />

            boots prattled as they stood on the steps of the colonnade <lb n="1515" />
            talking quietly and gaily, glancing at the clouds, holding their <lb n="1516" />
            umbrellas at cunning angles against the few last raindrops, <lb n="1517" />
            closing them again, holding their skirts demurely.<lb n="1518" /> </p>

            <p> Towards dawn he awoke. O what sweet music! His soul was <lb n="1523" />
            all dewy wet. Over his limbs in sleep pale cool waves of light <lb n="1524" />
            had passed. He lay still, as if his soul lay amid cool waters, <lb n="1525" />
            conscious of faint sweet music. His mind was waking slowly to <lb n="1526" />
            a tremulous morning knowledge, a morning inspiration. A <lb n="1527" />
            spirit filled him, pure as the purest water, sweet as dew, moving <lb n="1528" />
            as music. But how faintly it was inbreathed, how passionlessly <lb n="1529" />
            as if the seraphim themselves were breathing upon him! His <lb n="1530" />
            soul was waking slowly, fearing to awake wholly. It was that <lb n="1531" />
            windless hour of dawn when madness wakes and strange plants <lb n="1532" />
            open to the light and the moth flies forth silently.<lb n="1533" /> </p>
            <p> An enchantment of the heart! The night had been enchanted. In <lb n="1534" />
            dream or vision he had known the ecstasy of seraphic life. <lb n="1535" />
            Was it an instant of enchantment only or long hours and days <lb n="1536" />
            and years and ages?<lb n="1537" /> </p>
            <p> The instant of inspiration seemed now to be reflected from <lb n="1538" />
            all sides at once from a multitude of cloudy circumstance of <lb n="1539" />
            what had happened or of what might have happened. The in- <lb n="1540" />
            stant flashed forth like a point of light and now from cloud on <lb n="1541" />
            cloud of vague circumstance confused form  was veiling softly <lb n="1542" />
            its afterglow. O! In the virgin womb of the imagination the <lb n="1543" />
            word was made flesh. Gabriel the  seraph had come to the <lb n="1544" />
            virgin's chamber. An afterglow deepened within his spirit, <lb n="1545" />
            whence the white flame had passed, deepening to a rose and <lb n="1546" />
            ardent light. That rose and ardent light was her strange wilful <lb n="1547" />
            heart, strange that no man had known or would know, wilful <lb n="1548" />
            from before the beginning of the world: and lured by that <lb n="1549" />
            ardent roselike glow the choirs of the seraphim were falling <lb n="1550" />
            from heaven.<lb n="1551" /> </p>
            <lg>
              <l>Are you not weary of ardent ways,</l> <lb n="1552" />
              <l>Lure of the fallen seraphim?</l> <lb n="1553" />
              <l>Tell no more of enchanted days.</l> <lb n="1554" />
            </lg>
            <p> The verses passed from his mind to his lips and, murmuring <lb n="1555" />
            them over, he felt the rhythmic movement of a villanelle pass <lb n="1556" />
            through them. The roselike glow sent forth its rays of rhyme; <lb n="1557" />
            ways, days, blaze, praise, raise. Its rays burned up the world, <lb n="1558" />
            consumed the hearts of men and angels: the rays from the rose <lb n="1559" />
            that was her wilful heart.<lb n="1560" /> </p>
            <lg>
              <l>Your eyes have set man's heart ablaze</l> <lb n="1561" />
              <l>And you have had your will of him.</l> <lb n="1562" />
              <l>Are you not weary of ardent ways?</l> <lb n="1563" />
            </lg>
            <p> And then? The rhythm died away, ceased, began again to <lb n="1564" />
            move and beat. And then? Smoke, incense ascending from the <lb n="1565" />
            altar of the world.<lb n="1566" /> </p>
            <lg>
              <l>Above the flame the smoke of praise</l> <lb n="1567" />
              <l>Goes up from ocean rim to rim.</l> <lb n="1568" />
              <l>Tell no more of enchanted days.</l> <lb n="1569" />
            </lg>
            <p> Smoke went up from the whole earth, from the vapoury <lb n="1570" />
            oceans, smoke of her praise. The earth was like a swinging <lb n="1571" />
            swaying smoking [swaying] censer, a ball of incense, an ellipsoidal ball. <lb n="1572" />
            The rhythm died out at once; the cry of his heart was broken. <lb n="1573" />
            His lips began to murmur the first verses over and over; then <lb n="1574" />
            went on stumbling through half verses, stammering and <lb n="1575" />
            baffled; then stopped. The heart's cry was broken.<lb n="1576" /> </p>
            <p> The veiled windless hour had passed and behind the panes <lb n="1577" />
            of the naked window the morning light was gathering. A bell <lb n="1578" />
            beat faintly very far away. A bird twittered; two birds, three. <lb n="1579" />
            The bell and the birds ceased: and the dull white light  spread <lb n="1580" />
            itself east and west, covering the world, covering the roselight <lb n="1581" />
            in his heart.<lb n="1582" /> </p>
            <p> Fearing to lose all he raised himself suddenly on his elbow to <lb n="1583" />
            look for paper and pencil. There was neither on the table; only <lb n="1584" />
            the soup plate he had eaten the rice from for supper and the <lb n="1585" />
            candlestick with its tendrils of tallow and its paper socket, <lb n="1586" />
            singed by the last flame. He stretched his arm wearily towards <lb n="1587" />
            the foot of the bed, groping with his hand in the pockets of the <lb n="1588" />
            coat that hung there. His fingers found a pencil and then a <lb n="1589" />
            cigarette packet.  He  lay back and, tearing open the packet, <lb n="1590" />
            placed the last cigarette on the window ledge and began to <lb n="1591" />
            write out the stanzas of the villanelle in small neat letters on the <lb n="1592" />
            rough cardboard surface.<lb n="1593" /> </p>
            <p> Having written them out he lay back on the lumpy pillow, <lb n="1594" />
            murmuring them again. The lumps of knotted flock under his <lb n="1595" />
            head reminded him of the lumps of knotted horsehair in the <lb n="1596" />
            sofa of her parlour on which he used to sit, smiling or serious, <lb n="1597" />
            asking himself why he had come, displeased with her and with <lb n="1598" />
            himself, confounded by the print of the Sacred Heart above the <lb n="1599" />
            untenanted sideboard. He saw her approach him in a lull of the <lb n="1600" />
            talk and beg him to sing one of his curious songs. Then he saw <lb n="1601" />
            himself sitting at the old piano, striking chords softly from its <lb n="1602" />
            speckled keys and singing, amid the talk which had risen again <lb n="1603" />
            in the room, to her who leaned beside the mantelpiece a dainty <lb n="1604" />
            song of the Elizabethans, a sad and sweet loth to depart, the <lb n="1605" />
            victory chant of Agincourt, the happy air of Greensleeves. <lb n="1606" />
            While he sang and she listened, or feigned to listen, his heart <lb n="1607" />
            was at rest but when the quaint old songs had ended and he <lb n="1608" />
            heard again the voices in the room he remembered his own <lb n="1609" />
            sarcasm: the house where young men are called by their chris- <lb n="1610" />
            tian names a little too soon.<lb n="1611" /> </p>
            <p> At certain instants her eyes seemed about to trust him but he <lb n="1612" />
            had waited in vain. She passed now dancing lightly across his <lb n="1613" />
            memory as she had been that night at the carnival ball. Her <lb n="1614" />
            white dress a little lifted, a white spray nodding in her hair. She <lb n="1615" />
            danced lightly in the round. She was dancing towards him and, <lb n="1616" />
            as she came, her eyes were a little averted and a faint glow was <lb n="1617" />
            on her cheek. At the pause in the chain of hands her hand had <lb n="1618" />
            lain in his an instant, a soft merchandise. <lb n="1619" />
            <said who="???">&#8213;You are a great stranger now.<lb n="1620" /> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;Yes. I was born to be a monk.<lb n="1621" /> </said>
            <said who="???">&#8213;I am afraid you are a heretic.<lb n="1622" /> </said>
            <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;Are you much afraid?<lb n="1623" /></said> </p>
            <p> For answer she had danced away from him along the chain <lb n="1624" />
            of hands, dancing lightly and discreetly, giving herself to none. <lb n="1625" />
            The white spray nodded to her dancing and when she was in <lb n="1626" />
            shadow the glow was deeper on her cheek.<lb n="1627" /> </p>
            <p> A monk! His own image started forth a profaner of the <lb n="1628" />
            cloister, a heretic franciscan, willing and willing not to serve, <lb n="1629" />
            spinning like Gherardino da Borgo San Donnino a lithe web of <lb n="1630" />
            sophistry and whispering in her ear.<lb n="1631" /> </p>
            <p> No, it was not his image. It was the image of the young <lb n="1632" />
            priest in whose company he had seen her last, looking at him <lb n="1633" />
            out of dove's eyes, toying with the pages of her Irish phrase- <lb n="1634" />
            book. <lb n="1635" />
            <said who="???">&#8213;Yes, yes, the ladies are coming round to us. I can see it every <lb n="1636" />
            day. The ladies are with us. The best helpers the language has.<lb n="1637" /> </said>
            <said who="???">&#8213;And the church, Father Moran?<lb n="1638" /> </said>
            <said who="???">&#8213;The church too. Coming round too. The work is going <lb n="1639" />
            ahead there too. Don't fret about the church.<lb n="1640" /></said> </p>
            <p> Bah! he had done well to leave the room in disdain. He had <lb n="1641" />
            done well not to salute her on the steps of the library. He had <lb n="1642" />
            done well to leave her to flirt with her priest, to toy with a <lb n="1643" />
            church which was the scullerymaid of christendom.<lb n="1644" /> </p>
            <p> Rude brutal anger routed the last lingering instant of ecstasy <lb n="1645" />
            from his soul. It broke up violently her fair image and flung the <lb n="1646" />
            fragments on all sides. On all sides distorted reflections of her <lb n="1647" />
            image started from his memory: the flowergirl in the ragged <lb n="1648" />
            dress with damp coarse hair and a hoyden's face who had <lb n="1649" />
            called herself his own girl and begged his handsel, the kitchen- <lb n="1650" />
            girl in the next house who sang over the clatter of her plates <lb n="1651" />
            with the drawl of a country singer the first bars of <emph>By <lb n="1652" />
            Killarney's Lakes and Fells</emph>, a girl who had laughed gaily to see <lb n="1653" />
            him stumble when the iron grating in the footpath near <place><location><geo>53.343835 -6.267562</geo></location><placeName>Cork <lb n="1654" />
            Hill</placeName></place> had caught the broken sole of his shoe, a girl he had <lb n="1655" />
            glanced at, attracted by her small ripe mouth as she passed out <lb n="1656" />
            of Jacob's biscuit factory, who had cried to him over her shoul- <lb n="1657" />
            der: <lb n="1658" />
            <said who="???">&#8213;Do you like what you seen of me, straight hair and curly <lb n="1659" />
            eyebrows?<lb n="1660" /></said> </p>
            <p> And yet he felt that, however he might revile and mock her <lb n="1661" />
            image, his anger was also a form of homage. He had left the <lb n="1662" />
            classroom in disdain that was not wholly sincere, feeling that <lb n="1663" />
            perhaps the secret of her race lay behind those dark eyes upon <lb n="1664" />
            which her long lashes flung a quick shadow. He had told him- <lb n="1665" />
            self bitterly as he walked through the streets that she was a <lb n="1666" />
            figure of the womanhood of her country, a batlike soul waking <lb n="1667" />
            to the consciousness of itself in darkness and secrecy and lone- <lb n="1668" />
            liness, tarrying a while, loveless and sinless, with her mild lover <lb n="1669" />
            and leaving him to whisper of innocent transgressions in the <lb n="1670" />
            latticed ear of a priest. His anger against her found vent in <lb n="1671" />
            coarse railing at her paramour, whose name and voice and <lb n="1672" />
            features offended his baffled pride: a priested peasant, with a <lb n="1673" />
            brother a policeman in Dublin and a brother a potboy in <place><location><geo>53.338748 -9.181478</geo></location> <lb n="1674" />
            <placeName>Moycullen</placeName></place>. To him she would unveil her soul's shy nakedness, <lb n="1675" />
            to one who was but schooled in the discharging of a formal rite <lb n="1676" />
            rather than to him, a priest of the eternal imagination, trans- <lb n="1677" />
            muting the daily bread of experience into the radiant body of <lb n="1678" />
            everliving life.<lb n="1679" /> </p>
            <p> The radiant image of the eucharist united again in an instant <lb n="1680" />
            his bitter and despairing thoughts, their cries arising unbroken <lb n="1681" />
            in a hymn of thanksgiving.<lb n="1682" /> </p>
            <lg>
              <l>Our broken cries and mournful lays</l> <lb n="1683" />
              <l>Rise in one eucharistic hymn.</l> <lb n="1584" />
              <l>Are you not weary of ardent ways?</l> <lb n="1585" />
              <l>While sacrificing hands upraise</l> <lb n="1686" />
              <l>The chalice flowing to the brim.</l> <lb n="1587" />
              <l>Tell no more of enchanted days.</l> <lb n="1588" />
            </lg>
            <p> He spoke the verses aloud from the first lines till the music <lb n="1689" />
            and rhythm suffused his mind, turning it to quiet indulgence; <lb n="1690" />
            then copied them painfully to feel them the better by seeing <lb n="1691" />
            them; then lay back on his bolster.<lb n="1692" /> </p>
            <p> The full morning light had come. No sound was to be heard: <lb n="1693" />
            but he knew that all around him life was about to awaken in <lb n="1694" />
            common noises, hoarse voices, sleepy prayers. Shrinking from <lb n="1695" />
            that life he turned towards the wall, making a cowl of the <lb n="1696" />
            blanket and staring at the great overblown scarlet flowers of <lb n="1697" />
            the tattered wallpaper. He tried to warm his perishing joy in <lb n="1698" />
            their scarlet glow, imagining a roseway from where he lay <lb n="1699" />
            upwards to heaven all strewn  with scarlet flowers. Weary! <lb n="1700" />
            Weary! He too was weary of ardent ways.<lb n="1701" /> </p>
            <p> A gradual warmth, a languorous weariness passed over him <lb n="1702" />
            descending along his spine from his closely cowled  head. He <lb n="1703" />
            felt it descend and, seeing himself as he lay, smiled. Soon he <lb n="1704" />
            would sleep.<lb n="1705" /> </p>
            <p> He had written verses for her again after ten years. Ten years <lb n="1706" />
            before she had worn her shawl cowlwise about her head, send- <lb n="1707" />
            ing sprays of her warm breath into the night air, tapping her <lb n="1708" />
            foot upon the glassy road. It was the last tram; the lank brown <lb n="1709" />
            horses knew it and shook their bells to the clear night in <lb n="1710" />
            admonition. The conductor talked with the driver, both nod- <lb n="1711" />
            ding often in the green light of the lamp. They stood on the <lb n="1712" />
            steps of the tram, he on the upper, she on the lower. She came <lb n="1713" />
            up to his step many times between their phrases and went <lb n="1714" />
            down again and once or twice remained beside him forgetting <lb n="1715" />
            to go down and then went down. Let be! Let be!<lb n="1716" /> </p>
            <p> Ten years from that wisdom of children to his folly. If he <lb n="1717" />
            sent her the verses? They would be read out at breakfast amid <lb n="1718" />
            the tapping of eggshells. Folly indeed! The brothers would <lb n="1719" />
            laugh and try to wrest the page from each other with their <lb n="1720" />
            strong hard fingers. The suave priest, her uncle, seated in his <lb n="1721" />
            armchair, would hold the page at arm's length, read it smiling <lb n="1722" />
            and approve of the literary form.<lb n="1723" /> </p>
            <p> No, no: that was folly. Even if he sent her the verses she <lb n="1724" />
            would not show them to others. No, no: she could not.<lb n="1725" /> </p>
            <p> He began to feel that he had wronged her. A sense of her <lb n="1726" />
            innocence moved him almost to pity her, an innocence he had <lb n="1727" />
            never understood till he had come to the knowledge of it <lb n="1728" />
            through sin, an innocence which she too had not understood <lb n="1729" />
            while she was innocent or before the strange humiliation of her <lb n="1730" />
            nature had first come upon her. Then first her soul had begun <lb n="1731" />
            to live as his soul had when he had first sinned: and a tender <lb n="1732" />
            compassion filled his heart as he remembered her frail pallor <lb n="1733" />
            and her eyes, humbled and saddened by the dark shame of <lb n="1734" />
            womanhood.<lb n="1735" /> </p>
            <p> While his soul had passed from ecstasy to languor where had <lb n="1736" />
            she been? Might it be, in the mysterious ways of spiritual life, <lb n="1737" />
            that her soul at those same moments had been conscious of his <lb n="1738" />
            homage? It might be.<lb n="1739" /> </p>
            <p> A glow of desire kindled again his soul and fired and ful- <lb n="1740" />
            filled all his body. Conscious of his desire she was waking from <lb n="1741" />
            odorous sleep, the temptress of his villanelle. Her eyes, dark <lb n="1742" />
            and with a look of languor, were opening to his eyes. Her <lb n="1743" />
            nakedness yielded to him, radiant, warm, odorous and lavish- <lb n="1744" />
            limbed, enfolded him like a shining cloud, enfolded him like <lb n="1745" />
            water with a liquid life: and like a cloud of vapour or like <lb n="1746" />
            waters circumfluent in space the liquid letters of speech, sym- <lb n="1747" />
            bols of the element of mystery, flowed forth over his brain.<lb n="1748" /> </p>

              March evening made clear their flight, their dark darting <lb n="1772" />
              quivering bodies flying clearly against the sky as against a <lb n="1773" />
              limphung cloth of smoky tenuous blue.<lb n="1774" /> </p>
              <p> He watched their flight: bird after bird: a dark flash, a <lb n="1775" />
              swerve, a flash again, a dart aside, a curve, a flutter of wings. <lb n="1776" />
              He tried to count them before all their darting quivering bodies <lb n="1777" />
              passed: six, ten, eleven: and wondered were they odd or even in <lb n="1778" />
              number. Twelve, thirteen: for two came wheeling down from <lb n="1779" />
              the upper sky. They were flying high and low but ever round <lb n="1780" />
              and round in straight and curving lines and ever flying from left <lb n="1781" />
              to right, circling about a temple of air.<lb n="1782" /> </p>
              <p> He  listened to their cries: like the squeak of mice behind the <lb n="1783" />
              wainscot: a shrill twofold note. But the notes were long and <lb n="1784" />
              shrill and whirring, unlike the cry of vermin, falling a third or a <lb n="1785" />
              fourth and trilled as the flying beaks clove the air. Their cry <lb n="1786" />
              was shrill and clear and fine and falling like threads of silken <lb n="1787" />
              light unwound from whirring spools.<lb n="1788" /> </p>
              <p> The inhuman clamour soothed his ears in which his <lb n="1789" />
              mother's sobs and reproaches murmured insistently and the <lb n="1790" />
              dark frail quivering bodies wheeling and fluttering and swerv- <lb n="1791" />
              ing round an airy temple of the tenuous sky soothed his eyes <lb n="1792" />
              which still saw the image of his mother's face.<lb n="1793" /> </p>
              <p> Why was he gazing upwards from the steps of the porch, <lb n="1794" />
              hearing their shrill twofold cry, watching their flight? For an <lb n="1795" />
              augury of good or evil? A phrase of Cornelius Agrippa flew <lb n="1796" />
              through his mind and then there flew hither and thither shape- <lb n="1797" />
              less thoughts from Swedenborg on the correspondence of birds <lb n="1798" />
              to things of the intellect and of how the creatures of the air <lb n="1799" />
              have their knowledge and know their times and seasons be- <lb n="1800" />
              cause they, unlike man, are in the order of their life and have <lb n="1801" />
              not perverted that order by reason.<lb n="1802" /> </p>
              <p> And for ages men had gazed upward as he was gazing at <lb n="1803" />
              birds in flight. The colonnade above him made him think <lb n="1804" />
              vaguely of an ancient temple and the ashplant on which he <lb n="1805" />
              leaned wearily of the curved stick of an augur. A sense of fear <lb n="1806" />
              of the unknown moved in the heart of his weariness, a fear of <lb n="1807" />
              symbols and portents, of the hawklike man whose name he <lb n="1808" />
              bore soaring out of his captivity on osierwoven wings, of <lb n="1809" />
              Thoth, the god of writers, writing with a reed upon a tablet <lb n="1810" />
              and bearing on his narrow ibis head the cusped moon.<lb n="1811" /> </p>
              <p> He smiled as he thought of the god's image for it made him <lb n="1812" />
              think of a bottlenosed judge in a wig, putting commas into a <lb n="1813" />
              document which he held at arm's length and he knew that he <lb n="1814" />
              would not have remembered the god's name but that it was like <lb n="1815" />
              an Irish oath. It was folly. But was it for this folly that he was <lb n="1816" />
              about to leave for ever the house of prayer and prudence into <lb n="1817" />
              which he had been born and the order of life out of which he <lb n="1818" />
              had come?<lb n="1819" /> </p>
              <p> They came back with shrill cries over the jutting shoulder of <lb n="1820" />
              the house, flying darkly against the fading air. What birds were <lb n="1821" />
              they? He thought that they must be swallows who had come <lb n="1822" />
              back from the south. Then he was to go away? for they were <lb n="1823" />
              birds ever going and coming, building ever an unlasting home <lb n="1824" />
              under the eaves of men's houses and ever leaving the homes <lb n="1825" />
              they had built to wander.<lb n="1826" /> </p>
              <lg>
                <l>Bend down your faces, Oona and Aleel.</l> <lb n="1827" />
                <l>I gaze upon them as the swallow gazes</l> <lb n="1828" />
                <l>Upon the nest under the eave before</l> <lb n="1829" />
                <l>He wander the loud waters.</l> <lb n="1830" />
              </lg>
              <p> A soft liquid joy like the noise of many waters flowed over <lb n="1831" />
              his memory and he felt in his heart the soft peace of silent <lb n="1832" />
              spaces of fading tenuous sky above the waters, of oceanic si- <lb n="1833" />
              lence, of swallows flying through the seadusk over the flowing <lb n="1834" />
              waters.<lb n="1835" /> </p>
              <p> A soft liquid joy flowed through the words where the soft <lb n="1836" />
              long vowels hurtled noiselessly and fell away, lapping and <lb n="1837" />
              flowing back and ever shaking the white bells of their waves in <lb n="1838" />
              mute chime and mute peal and soft low swooning cry: and he <lb n="1839" />
              felt that the augury he had sought in the wheeling darting birds <lb n="1840" />
              and in the pale space of sky above him had come forth from his <lb n="1841" />
              heart like a bird from a turret quietly and swiftly.<lb n="1842" /> </p>
              <p> Symbol of departure or of loneliness? The verses crooned in <lb n="1843" />
              the ear of his memory composed slowly before his remember- <lb n="1844" />
              ing eyes the scene of the hall on the night of the opening of the <lb n="1845" />
              national theatre. He was alone at the side of the balcony, <lb n="1846" />
              looking out of jaded eyes at the culture of Dublin in the stalls <lb n="1847" />
              and at the tawdry scenecloths and human dolls framed by the <lb n="1848" />
              garish lamps of the stage. A burly policeman sweated behind <lb n="1849" />
              him and seemed at every moment about to act. The catcalls <lb n="1850" />
              and hisses and mocking cries ran in rude gusts round the hall <lb n="1851" />
              from his scattered fellowstudents. <lb n="1852" />
              <said who="???">&#8213;A libel on Ireland!<lb n="1853" /> </said>
              <said who="???">&#8213;Made in Germany!<lb n="1854" /> </said>
              <said who="???">&#8213;Blasphemy!<lb n="1855" /> </said>
              <said who="???">&#8213;We never sold our faith!<lb n="1856" /> </said>
              <said who="???">&#8213;No Irish woman ever did it!<lb n="1857" /> </said>
              <said who="???">&#8213;We want no amateur atheists.<lb n="1858" /> </said>
              <said who="???">&#8213;We want no budding buddhists.<lb n="1859" /></said> </p>
              <p> A sudden soft hiss fell from the windows above him and he <lb n="1860" />
              knew that the electric lamps had been switched on in the <lb n="1861" />
              readers' room. He turned into the pillared  hall, now calmly lit, <lb n="1862" />
              went up the staircase and passed in through the clicking turn- <lb n="1863" />
              stile.<lb n="1864" /> </p>
              <p> Cranly was sitting over near the dictionaries. A thick book, <lb n="1865" />
              opened at the frontispiece, lay before him on the wooden rest. <lb n="1866" />
              He leaned back in his chair, inclining his ear like that of a <lb n="1867" />
              confessor to the face of the medical student who was reading to <lb n="1868" />
              him a problem from the chess page of a journal. Stephen sat <lb n="1869" />
              down at his right and the priest at the other side of the  table <lb n="1870" />
              closed his copy of <emph>The Tablet</emph> with an angry snap and stood up.<lb n="1871" /> </p>
              <p> Cranly gazed after him blandly and vaguely. The medical <lb n="1872" />
              student went on in a softer voice: <lb n="1873" />
              <said who="???">&#8213;Pawn to king's fourth.<lb n="1874" /> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;We had better go, Dixon, said Stephen in warning. He has <lb n="1875" />
              gone to complain.<lb n="1876" /></said> </p>
              <p> Dixon folded the journal and rose with dignity, saying: <lb n="1877" />
              <said who="???">&#8213;Our men retired in good order.<lb n="1878" /> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;With guns and cattle, added Stephen, pointing to the title- <lb n="1879" />
              page of Cranly's book on which was printed <emph>Diseases of the <lb n="1880" />
              Ox</emph>.<lb n="1881" /></said> </p>
              <p> As they passed through a lane of the tables Stephen said: <lb n="1882" />
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;Cranly, I want to speak to you.<lb n="1883" /></said> </p>
              <p> Cranly did not answer or turn. He laid his book on the <lb n="1884" />
              counter and passed out, his wellshod feet sounding flatly on the <lb n="1885" />
              floor. On the staircase he paused and gazing absently at Dixon <lb n="1886" />
              repeated: <lb n="1887" />
              <said who="???">&#8213;Pawn to king's bloody fourth.<lb n="1888" /> </said>
              <said who="???">&#8213;Put it that way if you like, Dixon said.<lb n="1889" /></said> </p>
              <p> He had a quiet toneless voice and urbane manners and on a <lb n="1890" />
              finger of his plump clean hand he displayed at moments a <lb n="1891" />
              signet ring.<lb n="1892" /> </p>
              <p> As they crossed the hall a man of dwarfish stature came <lb n="1893" />
              towards them. Under the dome of his tiny hat his unshaven <lb n="1894" />
              face began to smile with pleasure and he was heard to murmur. <lb n="1895" />
              The eyes were melancholy as those of a monkey. <lb n="1896" />
              <said who="???">&#8213;Good evening, captain, said Cranly, halting.<lb n="1897" /> </said>
              <said who="???">&#8213;Good evening, gentlemen, said the stubblegrown monkeyish <lb n="1898" />
              face.<lb n="1899" /> </said>
              <said who="???">&#8213;Warm weather for March, said Cranly. They have the win- <lb n="1900" />
              dows open upstairs.<lb n="1901" /></said> </p>
              <p> Dixon smiled and turned his ring. The blackish monkey- <lb n="1902" />
              puckered face pursed its human mouth with gentle pleasure <lb n="1903" />
              and its voice purred: <lb n="1904" />
              <said who="???">&#8213;Delightful weather for March. Simply delightful.<lb n="1905" /> </said>
              <said who="???">&#8213;There are two nice young ladies upstairs, captain, tired of <lb n="1906" />
              waiting, Dixon said.<lb n="1907" /></said> </p>
              <p> Cranly smiled and said kindly: <lb n="1908" />
              <said who="???">&#8213;The captain has only one love: sir Walter Scott. Isn't that so, <lb n="1909" />
              captain?<lb n="1910" /> </said>
              <said who="???">&#8213;What are you reading now, captain? Dixon asked. <emph>The Bride <lb n="1911" />
              of <place><location><geo>55.775902 -4.136255</geo></location><placeName>Lammermoor</placeName></place>?</emph><lb n="1912" /> </said>
              <said who="???">&#8213;I love old Scott, the flexible lips said. I think he writes some- <lb n="1913" />
              thing lovely. There is no writer can touch sir Walter Scott.<lb n="1914" /></said> </p>
              <p> He moved a thin shrunken brown hand gently in the air in <lb n="1915" />
              time to his praise and his thin quick eyelids beat often over his <lb n="1916" />
              sad eyes.<lb n="1917" /> </p>
              <p> Sadder to Stephen's ear was his speech: a genteel accent, low <lb n="1918" />
              and moist, marred by errors: and listening to it he wondered <lb n="1919" />
              was the story true and was the thin blood that flowed in his <lb n="1920" />
              shrunken frame noble and come of an incestuous  love?<lb n="1921" /> </p>
              <p> The park trees were heavy with rain and rain fell still and <lb n="1922" />
              ever in the lake, lying grey like a shield. A game of swans flew <lb n="1923" />
              there and the water and the shore beneath were fouled with <lb n="1924" />
              their greenwhite slime. They embraced softly impelled by the <lb n="1925" />
              grey rainy light, the wet silent trees, the shieldlike witnessing <lb n="1926" />
              lake, the swans. They embraced without joy or passion, his <lb n="1927" />
              arm about his sister's neck. A grey woollen cloak was wrapped <lb n="1928" />
              athwart her from her shoulder to her waist: and her fair head was <lb n="1929" />
              bent in willing shame. He had loose redbrown hair and tender <lb n="1930" />
              shapely strong freckled hands. Face? There was no face seen. <lb n="1931" />
              The brother's face was bent upon her fair rainfragrant hair. <lb n="1932" />
              The hand freckled and strong and shapely and caressing was <lb n="1933" />
              Davin's hand.<lb n="1934" /> </p>
              <p> He frowned angrily upon his thought and on the shrivelled <lb n="1935" />
              mannikin who had called it forth. His father's gibes at the <place><location><geo>51.680080 -9.452576</geo></location> <lb n="1936" />
              <placeName>Bantry</placeName></place> gang leaped out of his memory. He held them at a <lb n="1937" />
              distance and brooded uneasily on his own thought again. Why <lb n="1938" />
              were they not  Cranly's hands? Had Davin's simplicity and in- <lb n="1939" />
              nocence stung him more secretly?<lb n="1940" /> </p>
              <p> He walked on across the hall with Dixon, leaving Cranly to <lb n="1941" />
              take leave elaborately of the dwarf.<lb n="1942" /> </p>
              <p> Under the colonnade Temple was standing in the midst of a <lb n="1943" />
              little group of students. One of them cried: <lb n="1944" />
              <said who="???">&#8213;Dixon, come over till you hear. Temple is in grand form.<lb n="1945" /></said> </p>
              <p> Temple turned on him his dark gipsy eyes. <lb n="1946" />
              <said who="???">&#8213;You're a hypocrite, O'Keeffe, he said. And Dixon's a smiler. <lb n="1947" />
              By hell, I think that's a good literary expression.<lb n="1948" /></said> </p>
              <p> He laughed slily, looking in Stephen's face, repeating: <lb n="1949" />
              <said who="???">&#8213;By hell, I'm delighted with that name. A smiler.<lb n="1950" /></said> </p>
              <p> A stout student who stood below them on the steps said: <lb n="1951" />
              <said who="???">&#8213;Come back to the mistress, Temple. We want to hear about <lb n="1952" />
              that.<lb n="1953" /> </said>
              <said who="???">&#8213;He had, faith, Temple said. And he was a married man too. <lb n="1954" />
              And all the priests used to be dining there. By hell, I think they <lb n="1955" />
              all had a touch.<lb n="1956" /> </said>
              <said who="???">&#8213;We shall call it riding a hack to spare the hunter, said Dixon.<lb n="1957" /> </said>
              <said who="???">&#8213;Tell us, Temple, O'Keeffe said. How many quarts of porter <lb n="1958" />
              have you in you?<lb n="1959" /> </said>
              <said who="???">&#8213;All your intellectual soul is in that phrase, O'Keeffe, said <lb n="1960" />
              Temple with open scorn.<lb n="1961" /></said> </p>
              <p> He moved with a shambling gait round the group and spoke <lb n="1962" />
              to Stephen. <lb n="1963" />
              <said who="???">&#8213;Did you know that the Forsters are the kings of Belgium? he <lb n="1964" />
              asked.<lb n="1965" /></said> </p>
              <p> Cranly came out through the door of the entrance hall, his <lb n="1966" />
              hat thrust back on the nape of his neck and picking his teeth <lb n="1967" />
              with care. <lb n="1968" />
              <said who="???">&#8213;And here's the wiseacre, said Temple. Do you know that <lb n="1969" />
              about the Forsters?<lb n="1970" /></said> </p>
              <p> He paused for an answer. Cranly dislodged a figseed from <lb n="1971" />
              his teeth on the point of his rude toothpick and gazed at it <lb n="1972" />
              intently. <lb n="1973" />
              <said who="???">&#8213;The Forster  family, Temple said, is descended from Baldwin <lb n="1974" />
              the First, king of Flanders. He was called the Forester. Forester <lb n="1975" />
              and Forster are the same name. A descendant of Baldwin the <lb n="1976" />
              First, captain Francis Forster, settled in Ireland and married <lb n="1977" />
              the daughter of the last chieftain of Clanbrassil. Then there are <lb n="1978" />
              the Blake Forsters. That's a different branch.<lb n="1979" /> </said>
              <said who="???">&#8213;From Baldhead, king of Flanders, Cranly repeated, rooting <lb n="1980" />
              again deliberately at his gleaming uncovered teeth.<lb n="1981" /> </said>
              <said who="???">&#8213;Where did you pick up all that history? O'Keeffe asked.<lb n="1982" /> </said>
              <said who="???">&#8213;I know all the history of your family too, Temple said, <lb n="1983" />
              turning to Stephen. Do you know what Giraldus Cambrensis <lb n="1984" />
              says about your family?<lb n="1985" /> </said>
              <said who="???">&#8213;Is he descended from Baldwin too? asked a tall consumptive <lb n="1986" />
              student with dark eyes.<lb n="1987" /> </said>
              <said who="???">&#8213;Baldhead, Cranly repeated, sucking at a crevice in his teeth.<lb n="1988" /> </said>
              <said who="???">&#8213;<seg xml:lang="la">Pernobilis et pervetusta familia</seg>, Temple said to Stephen.<lb n="1989" /></said> </p>
              <p> The stout student who stood below them on the steps farted <lb n="1990" />
              briefly. Dixon turned towards him saying in a soft voice: <lb n="1991" />
              <said who="???">&#8213;Did an angel speak?<lb n="1992" /></said> </p>
              <p> Cranly turned also and said vehemently but without anger: <lb n="1993" />
              <said who="???">&#8213;Goggins, you're the flamingest dirty devil I ever met, do you <lb n="1994" />
              know.<lb n="1995" /> </said>
              <said who="???">&#8213;I had it on my mind to say that, Goggins answered firmly. It <lb n="1996" />
              did no-one any harm, did it?<lb n="1997" /> </said>
              <said who="???">&#8213;We hope, Dixon said suavely, that it was not of the kind <lb n="1998" />
              known to science as a <seg xml:lang="la">paulo post futurum</seg>.<lb n="1999" /> </said>
              <said who="???">&#8213;Didn't I tell you he was a smiler? said Temple, turning right <lb n="2000" />
              and left. Didn't I give him that name?<lb n="2001" /> </said>
              <said who="???">&#8213;You did. We're not deaf, said the tall consumptive.<lb n="2002" /></said> </p>
              <p> Cranly still frowned at the stout student below him. Then, <lb n="2003" />
              with a snort of disgust, he shoved him violently down the steps. <lb n="2004" />
              <said who="???">&#8213;Go away from here, he said rudely. Go away, you stinkpot. <lb n="2005" />
              And you are a stinkpot.<lb n="2006" /></said> </p>
              <p> Goggins skipped down on to the gravel and at once returned <lb n="2007" />
              to his place with good humour. Temple turned back to Stephen <lb n="2008" />
              and asked: <lb n="2009" />
              <said who="???">&#8213;Do you believe in the law of heredity?<lb n="2010" /> </said>
              <said who="???">&#8213;Are you drunk or what are you or what are you trying to <lb n="2011" />
              say? asked Cranly, facing round on him with an expression of <lb n="2012" />
              wonder.<lb n="2013" /> </said>
              <said who="???">&#8213;The most profound sentence ever written, Temple said with <lb n="2014" />
              enthusiasm, is the sentence at the end of the zoology. Repro- <lb n="2015" />
              duction is the beginning of death.<lb n="2016" /></said> </p>
              <p> He touched Stephen timidly at the elbow and said eagerly: <lb n="2017" />
              <said who="???">&#8213;Do you feel how profound that is because you are a poet?<lb n="2018" /></said> </p>
              <p> Cranly pointed his long forefinger. <lb n="2019" />
              <said who="???">&#8213;Look at him! he said with scorn to the others. Look at <lb n="2020" />
              Ireland's hope!<lb n="2021" /></said> </p>
              <p> They laughed at his words and gesture. Temple turned on <lb n="2022" />
              him bravely, saying: <lb n="2023" />
              <said who="???">&#8213;Cranly, you're always sneering at me. I can see that. But I <lb n="2024" />
              am as good as you are any day. Do you know what I think <lb n="2025" />
              about you now as compared with myself?<lb n="2026" /> </said>
              <said who="???">&#8213;My dear man, said Cranly urbanely, you are incapable, do <lb n="2027" />
              you know, absolutely incapable of thinking.<lb n="2028" /> </said>
              <said who="???">&#8213;But do you know, Temple went on, what I think of you and <lb n="2029" />
              of myself compared together?<lb n="2030" /> </said>
              <said who="???">&#8213;Out with it, Temple! the stout student cried from the steps. <lb n="2031" />
              Get it out in bits!<lb n="2032" /></said> </p>
              <p> Temple turned right and left, making sudden feeble gestures <lb n="2033" />
              as he spoke. <lb n="2034" />
              <said who="???">&#8213;I'm a ballocks, he said, shaking his head in despair. I am. <lb n="2035" />
              And I know I am. And I admit it that I am.<lb n="2036" /></said> </p>
              <p> Dixon patted him lightly on the shoulder and said mildly: <lb n="2037" />
              <said who="???">&#8213;And it does you every credit, Temple.<lb n="2038" /> </said>
              <said who="???">&#8213;But he, Temple said, pointing to Cranly. He is a ballocks too <lb n="2039" />
              like me. Only he doesn't know it. And that's the only difference <lb n="2040" />
              I see.<lb n="2041" /></said> </p>
              <p> A burst of laughter covered his words. But he turned again <lb n="2042" />
              to Stephen and said with a sudden eagerness: <lb n="2043" />
              <said who="???">&#8213;That word is a most interesting word. That's the only Eng- <lb n="2044" />
              lish dual number. Did you know?<lb n="2045" /> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;Is it? Stephen said vaguely.<lb n="2046" /></said> </p>
              <p> He was watching Cranly's firmfeatured suffering face, lit up <lb n="2047" />
              now by a smile of false patience. The gross name had passed <lb n="2048" />
              over it like foul water poured over an old stone image, patient <lb n="2049" />
              of injuries: and, as he watched him, he saw him raise his hat in <lb n="2050" />
              salute and uncover the black hair that stood up stiffly from his <lb n="2051" />
              forehead like an iron crown.<lb n="2052" /> </p>
              <p> She passed out from the porch of the library and bowed <lb n="2053" />
              across Stephen in reply to Cranly's greeting. He also? Was there <lb n="2054" />
              not a slight flush on Cranly's cheek? Or had it come forth at <lb n="2055" />
              Temple's words? The light had waned. He could not see.<lb n="2056" /> </p>
              <p> Did that explain his friend's listless silence, his harsh com- <lb n="2057" />
              ments, the sudden intrusions of rude speech with which he had <lb n="2058" />
              shattered so often Stephen's ardent wayward confessions? Ste- <lb n="2059" />
              phen had forgiven freely for he had found this rudeness also in <lb n="2060" />
              himself towards himself. And he remembered an evening when <lb n="2061" />
              he had dismounted from a borrowed creaking bicycle to pray <lb n="2062" />
              to God in a wood near <place><location><geo>53.450924 -6.150138</geo></location><placeName>Malahide</placeName></place>. He had lifted up his arms <lb n="2063" />
              and spoken in ecstasy to the sombre nave of the trees, knowing <lb n="2064" />
              that he stood on holy ground and in a holy hour. And when <lb n="2065" />
              two constabularymen had come into sight round a bend in the <lb n="2066" />
              gloomy road he had broken off his prayer to whistle loudly an <lb n="2067" />
              air from the last pantomime.<lb n="2068" /> </p>
              <p> He began to beat the frayed end of his ashplant against the <lb n="2069" />
              base of a pillar. Had Cranly not heard him? Yet he could wait. <lb n="2070" />
              The talk about him ceased for a moment: and a soft hiss fell <lb n="2071" />
              again from a window above. But no other sound was in the air <lb n="2072" />
              and the swallows whose flight he had followed with idle eyes <lb n="2073" />
              were sleeping.<lb n="2074" /> </p>
              <p> She had passed through the dusk. And therefore the air was <lb n="2075" />
              silent save for one soft hiss that fell. And therefore the tongues <lb n="2076" />
              about him had ceased their babble. Darkness  was falling.<lb n="2077" /> </p>
              <p> <l><emph>Darkness falls from the air.</emph></l><lb n="2078" /> </p>
              <p> A trembling joy, lambent as a faint light, played like a fairy <lb n="2079" />
              host around him. But why? Her passage through the darkening <lb n="2080" />
              air or the verse with its black vowels and its opening sound, <lb n="2081" />
              rich and lutelike?<lb n="2082" /> </p>
              <p> He walked away slowly towards the deeper shadows at the <lb n="2083" />
              end of the colonnade, beating the stone softly with his stick to <lb n="2084" />
              hide his revery from the students whom he had left: and <lb n="2085" />
              allowed his mind to summon back to itself the age of Dowland <lb n="2086" />
              and Byrd and Nash.<lb n="2087" /> </p>
              <p> Eyes, opening from the darkness of desire, eyes that dimmed <lb n="2088" />
              the breaking east. What was their languid grace but the soft- <lb n="2089" />
              ness of chambering? And what was their shimmer but the <lb n="2090" />
              shimmer of the scum that mantled the cesspool of the court of a <lb n="2091" />
              slobbering Stuart. And he tasted in the language of memory <lb n="2092" />
              ambered wines, dying fallings of sweet airs, the proud pavan: <lb n="2093" />
              and saw with the eyes of memory kind gentlewomen in <place><location><geo>51.511732 -0.123270</geo></location><placeName>Covent <lb n="2094" />
              Garden</placeName></place> wooing from their balconies with sucking mouths and <lb n="2095" />
              the poxfouled wenches of the taverns and young wives that, <lb n="2096" />
              gaily yielding to their ravishers, clipped and clipped again.<lb n="2097" /> </p>
              <p> The images he had summoned gave him no pleasure. They <lb n="2098" />
              were secret and enflaming but her image was not entangled by <lb n="2099" />
              them. That was not the way to think of her. It was not even the <lb n="2100" />
              way in which he thought of her. Could his mind then not trust <lb n="2101" />
              itself? Old phrases, sweet only with a disinterred sweetness like <lb n="2102" />
              the figseeds Cranly rooted out of his gleaming teeth.<lb n="2103" /> </p>
              <p> It was not thought nor vision though he knew vaguely that <lb n="2104" />
              her figure was passing homeward through the city. Vaguely <lb n="2105" />
              first and then more sharply he smelt her body. A conscious <lb n="2106" />
              unrest seethed in his blood. Yes, it was her body that he smelt: <lb n="2107" />
              a wild and languid smell: the tepid limbs over which his music <lb n="2108" />
              had flowed desirously and the secret soft linen upon which her <lb n="2109" />
              flesh distilled odour and a dew.<lb n="2110" /> </p>
              <p> A louse crawled over the nape of his neck and, putting his <lb n="2111" />
              thumb and forefinger deftly beneath his loose collar, he caught <lb n="2112" />
              it. He rolled its body, tender yet brittle as a grain of rice, be- <lb n="2113" />
              tween thumb and finger for an instant before he let it fall from <lb n="2114" />
              him and wondered would it live or die. There came to his mind <lb n="2115" />
              a curious phrase from Cornelius a Lapide which said that the <lb n="2116" />
              lice born of human sweat were not created by God with the <lb n="2117" />
              other animals on the sixth day. But the tickling of the skin of <lb n="2118" />
              his neck made his mind raw and red. The life of his body, <lb n="2119" />
              illclad, illfed, louseeaten, made him close his eyelids in a sud- <lb n="2120" />
              den spasm of despair: and in the darkness he saw the brittle <lb n="2121" />
              bright bodies of lice falling from the air and turning often as <lb n="2122" />
              they fell. Yes: and it was not darkness that fell from the air. It <lb n="2123" />
              was brightness.<lb n="2124" /> </p>
              <p> <l><emph>Brightness falls from the air.</emph></l> <lb n="2125" />
              <p> He had not even remembered rightly Nash's line. All the <lb n="2126" />
              images it  had awakened were false. His mind bred vermin. His <lb n="2127" />
              thoughts were lice born of the sweat of sloth.<lb n="2128" /> </p>
              <p> He came back quickly along the colonnade towards the <lb n="2129" />
              group of students. Well then let her go and be damned to her. <lb n="2130" />
              She could love some clean athlete who washed himself every <lb n="2131" />
              morning to the waist and had black hair on his chest. Let her.<lb n="2132" /> </p>
              <p> Cranly had taken another dried fig from the supply in his <lb n="2133" />
              pocket and was eating it slowly and noisily. Temple sat on the <lb n="2134" />
              pediment of a pillar, leaning back, his cap pulled down on his <lb n="2135" />
              sleepy eyes. A squat young man came out of the porch, a <lb n="2136" />
              leather portfolio tucked under his armpit. He marched towards <lb n="2137" />
              the group, striking the flags with the heels of his boots and <lb n="2138" />
              with the ferrule of his heavy umbrella. Then, raising the um- <lb n="2139" />
              brella in salute, he said to all: <lb n="2140" />
              <said who="???">&#8213;Good evening, sirs.<lb n="2141" /></said> </p>
              <p> He struck the flags again and tittered while his head <lb n="2142" />
              trembled with a slight nervous movement. The tall consump- <lb n="2143" />
              tive student and Dixon and O'Keeffe were speaking in Irish and <lb n="2144" />
              did not answer him. Then, turning to Cranly, he said: <lb n="2145" />
              <said who="???">&#8213;Good evening, particularly to you.<lb n="2146" /></said> </p>
              <p> He moved the umbrella in indication and tittered again. <lb n="2147" />
              Cranly, who was still chewing the fig, answered with loud <lb n="2148" />
              movements of his jaws. <lb n="2149" />
              <said who="???">&#8213;Good? Yes. It is a good evening.<lb n="2150" /></said> </p>
              <p> The squat student looked at him seriously and shook his <lb n="2151" />
              umbrella gently and reprovingly. <lb n="2152" />
              <said who="???">&#8213;I can see, he said, that you are about to make obvious <lb n="2153" />
              remarks.<lb n="2154" /> </said>
              <said who="???">&#8213;Um, Cranly answered, holding out what remained of the <lb n="2155" />
              halfchewed fig and jerking it towards the squat student's <lb n="2156" />
              mouth in sign that he should eat.<lb n="2157" /></said> </p>
              <p> The squat student did not eat it but, indulging his  special <lb n="2158" />
              humour, said gravely, still tittering and prodding his phrase <lb n="2159" />
              with his  umbrella: <lb n="2160" />
              <said who="???">&#8213;Do you intend that ...<lb n="2161" /></said> </p>
              <p> He broke off, pointed bluntly to the munched pulp of the fig <lb n="2162" />
              and said loudly: <lb n="2163" />
              <said who="???">&#8213;I allude to that.<lb n="2164" /> </said>
              <said who="???">&#8213;Um, Cranly said as before.<lb n="2165" /> </said>
              <said who="???">&#8213;Do you intend that now, the squat student said, as <emph>ipso facto</emph> <lb n="2166" />
              or, let us say, as so to speak?<lb n="2167" /></said> </p>
              <p> Dixon turned aside from his group, saying: <lb n="2168" />
              <said who="???">&#8213;Goggins was waiting for you, Glynn. He has gone round to <lb n="2169" />
              the Adelphi to look for you and Moynihan. What have you <lb n="2170" />
              there? he asked, tapping the portfolio under Glynn's arm.<lb n="2171" /> </said>
              <p> <said who="???">&#8213;Examination papers, Glynn answered. I give them monthly <lb n="2172" />
              examinations to see that they are profiting by my tuition.<lb n="2173" /></said> </p>
              <p> He also tapped the portfolio and coughed gently and smiled. <lb n="2174" />
              <said who="???">&#8213;Tuition! said Cranly rudely. I suppose you mean the bare- <lb n="2175" />
              footed children that are taught by a bloody ape like you. God <lb n="2176" />
              help them!<lb n="2177" /></said> </p>
              <p> He bit off the rest of the fig and flung away the butt. <lb n="2178" />
              <said who="???">&#8213;I suffer little children to come unto me, Glynn said amiably.<lb n="2179" /> </said>
              <said who="???">&#8213;A bloody ape, Cranly repeated with emphasis, and a blas- <lb n="2180" />
              phemous bloody ape!<lb n="2181" /></said> </p>
              <p> Temple stood up and, pushing past Cranly, addressed <lb n="2182" />
              Glynn: <lb n="2183" />
              <said who="???">&#8213;That phrase you said now, he said, is from the new testa- <lb n="2184" />
              ment about suffer the children to come to me.<lb n="2185" /> </said>
              <said who="???">&#8213;Go to sleep again, Temple, said O'Keeffe.<lb n="2186" /> </said>
              <said who="???">&#8213;Very well, then, Temple continued, still addressing Glynn, <lb n="2187" />
              and if Jesus suffered the children to come why does the church <lb n="2188" />
              send them all to hell if they die unbaptised? Why is that?<lb n="2189" /> </said>
              <said who="???">&#8213;Were you baptised yourself, Temple? the consumptive stu- <lb n="2190" />
              dent asked.<lb n="2191" /> </said>
              <said who="???">&#8213;But why are they sent to hell if Jesus said they were all to <lb n="2192" />
              come? Temple said, his eyes searching in Glynn's eyes.<lb n="2193" /></said> </p>
              <p> Glynn coughed and said gently, holding back with difficulty <lb n="2194" />
              the nervous titter in his voice and moving his umbrella at every <lb n="2195" />
              word: <lb n="2196" />
              <said who="???">&#8213;And, as you remark, if it is thus I ask emphatically whence <lb n="2197" />
              comes this thusness.<lb n="2198" /> </said>
              <said who="???">&#8213;Because the church is cruel like all old sinners, Temple said.<lb n="2199" /> </said>
              <said who="???">&#8213;Are you quite orthodox on that point, Temple? Dixon said <lb n="2200" />
              suavely.<lb n="2201" /> </said>
              <said who="???">&#8213;Saint Augustine says that about unbaptised children going to <lb n="2202" />
              hell, Temple answered, because he was a cruel old sinner too.<lb n="2203" /> </said>
              <said who="???">&#8213;I bow to you, Dixon said, but I had the impression that <lb n="2204" />
              limbo existed for such cases.<lb n="2205" /> </said>
              <said who="???">&#8213;Don't argue with him, Dixon, Cranly said brutally. Don't <lb n="2206" />
              talk to him or look at him. Lead him home with a sugan the <lb n="2207" />
              way you'd lead a bleating goat.<lb n="2208" /> </said>
              <said who="???">&#8213;Limbo! Temple cried. That's a fine invention too. Like hell.<lb n="2209" /> </said>
              <said who="???">&#8213;But with the unpleasantness left out, Dixon said.<lb n="2210" /></said> </p>
              <p> He turned smiling to the others and said: <lb n="2211" />
              <said who="???">&#8213;I think I am voicing the opinions of all present in saying so <lb n="2212" />
              much.<lb n="2213" /> </said>
              <said who="???">&#8213;You are, Glynn said in a firm tone. On that point Ireland is <lb n="2214" />
              united.<lb n="2215" /></said> </p>
              <p> He struck the ferrule of his umbrella on the stone floor of <lb n="2216" />
              the colonnade. <lb n="2217" />
              <said who="???">&#8213;Hell, Temple said. I can respect that invention of the grey <lb n="2218" />
              spouse of Satan. Hell is Roman, like the walls of the Romans, <lb n="2219" />
              strong and ugly. But what is limbo?<lb n="2220" /> </said>
              <said who="???">&#8213;Put him back into  the perambulator, Cranly, O'Keeffe called <lb n="2221" />
              out.<lb n="2222" /></said> </p>
              Cranly made a swift step towards Temple, halted, stamping <lb n="2223" />
              his foot and crying as if to a fowl: <lb n="2224" />
              <said who="Cranly">&#8213;Hoosh!<lb n="2225" /></said> </p>
              Temple moved away nimbly. <lb n="2226" />
              <said who="Temple">&#8213;Do you know what limbo is? he cried. Do you know what <lb n="2227" />
              we call a notion like that in Roscommon?<lb n="2228" /> </said>
              <said who="Cranly">&#8213;Hoosh! Blast you! Cranly cried, clapping his hands.<lb n="2229" /> </said>
              <said who="Temple">&#8213;Neither my arse nor my elbow! Temple cried out scornfully. <lb n="2230" />
              And that's what I call limbo.<lb n="2231" /> </said>
              <said who="Cranly">&#8213;Give us that stick here, Cranly said.<lb n="2232" /></said> </p>
              <p> He snatched the ashplant roughly from Stephen's hand and <lb n="2233" />
              sprang down the steps: but Temple, hearing him move in pur- <lb n="2234" />
              suit, fled through the dusk like a wild creature, nimble and <lb n="2235" />
              fleetfooted. Cranly's heavy boots were heard loudly charging <lb n="2236" />
              across the quadrangle and then returning heavily, foiled and <lb n="2237" />
              spurning the gravel at each step.<lb n="2238" /> </p>
              <p> His step was angry and with an angry abrupt gesture he <lb n="2239" />
              thrust the stick back into Stephen's hand. Stephen felt that his <lb n="2240" />
              anger had another cause but, feigning patience, touched his <lb n="2241" />
              arm slightly and said quietly: <lb n="2242" />
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;Cranly, I told you I wanted to speak to you. Come away.<lb n="2243" /></said> </p>
              <p> Cranly looked at him for a few moments and asked: <lb n="2244" />
              <said who="???">&#8213;Now?<lb n="2245" /> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;Yes, now, Stephen said. We can't speak here. Come away.<lb n="2246" /></said> </p>
              <p> They crossed the quadrangle together without speaking. The <lb n="2247" />
              birdcall from <emph>Siegfried</emph> whistled softly followed them from the <lb n="2248" />
              steps of the porch. Cranly turned: and Dixon, who had <lb n="2249" />
              whistled, called out: <lb n="2250" />
              <said who="???">&#8213;Where are you fellows off to? What about that  game, <lb n="2251" />
              Cranly?<lb n="2252" /></said> </p>
              <p> They parleyed in shouts across the still air about a game of <lb n="2253" />
              billiards to be played in the <place><location><geo>53.350570 -6.254002</geo></location><placeName>Adelphi hotel</placeName></place>. Stephen walked on <lb n="2254" />
              alone and out into the quiet of Kildare Street. Opposite <lb n="2255" />
              Maple's hotel he stood to wait, patient again. The name of the <lb n="2256" />
              hotel, a colourless polished wood, and its colourless quiet front <lb n="2257" />
              stung him like a glance of polite disdain. He stared angrily back <lb n="2258" />
              at the softly lit drawingroom of the hotel in which he imagined <lb n="2259" />
              the sleek lives of the patricians of Ireland housed in calm. They <lb n="2260" />
              thought of army commissions and land agents: peasants greeted <lb n="2261" />
              them along the roads  in the country: they knew the names of <lb n="2262" />
              certain French dishes and gave orders to jarvies in highpitched <lb n="2263" />
              provincial voices which pierced through their skintight accents.<lb n="2264" /> </p>
              <p> How could he hit their conscience or how cast his shadow <lb n="2265" />
              over the imagination of their daughters, before their squires <lb n="2266" />
              begat upon them, that they might breed a race less ignoble than <lb n="2267" />
              their own? And under the deepened dusk he felt the thoughts <lb n="2268" />
              and desires of the race to which he belonged flitting like bats <lb n="2269" />
              across the dark country lanes,  under trees by the edges of <lb n="2270" />
              streams and near the poolmottled bogs. A woman had waited <lb n="2271" />
              in the doorway as Davin had passed by at night and, offering <lb n="2272" />
              him a cup of milk, had all but wooed him to her bed: for Davin <lb n="2273" />
              had the mild eyes of one that could be secret. But him no <lb n="2274" />
              woman's eyes had wooed.<lb n="2275" /> </p>
              <p> His arm was taken in a strong grip and Cranly's voice said: <lb n="2276" />
              <said who="???">&#8213;Let us eke go.<lb n="2277" /></said> </p>
              <p> They walked southward in silence. Then Cranly said: <lb n="2278" />
              <said who="???">&#8213;That blithering idiot Temple! I swear to Moses, do you <lb n="2279" />
              know, that I'll be the death of that fellow one time.<lb n="2280" /></said> </p>
              <p> But his voice was no longer angry and Stephen wondered <lb n="2281" />
              was he thinking of her greeting to him under the porch.<lb n="2282" /> </p>
              <p> They turned to the left and walked on as before. When they <lb n="2283" />
              had gone on so for some time Stephen said: <lb n="2284" />
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;Cranly, I had an unpleasant quarrel this evening.<lb n="2285" /> </said>
              <said who="???">&#8213;With your people? Cranly asked.<lb n="2286" /> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;With my mother.<lb n="2287" /> </said>
              <said who="???">&#8213;About religion?<lb n="2288" /> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;Yes, Stephen answered.<lb n="2289" /></said> </p>
              <p> After a pause Cranly asked: <lb n="2290" />
              <said who="???">&#8213;What age is your mother?<lb n="2291" /> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;Not old, Stephen said. She wishes me to make my easter <lb n="2292" />
              duty.<lb n="2293" /> </said>
              <said who="???">&#8213;And will you?<lb n="2294" /> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;I will not, Stephen said.<lb n="2295" /> </said>
              <said who="???">&#8213;Why not? Cranly said.<lb n="2296" /> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;I will not serve, answered Stephen.<lb n="2297" /> </said>
              <said who="???">&#8213;That remark was made before, Cranly said calmly.<lb n="2298" /> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;It is made behind now, said Stephen hotly.<lb n="2299" /></said> </p>
              <p> Cranly pressed Stephen's arm, saying: <lb n="2300" />
              <said who="???">&#8213;Go easy, my dear man. You're an excitable bloody man, do <lb n="2301" />
              you know.<lb n="2302" /></said> </p>
              <p> He laughed nervously as he spoke and, looking up into Ste- <lb n="2303" />
              phen's face with moved and friendly eyes, said: <lb n="2304" />
              <said who="???">&#8213;Do you know that you are an excitable man?<lb n="2305" /> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;I daresay I am, said Stephen, laughing also.<lb n="2306" /></said> </p>
              <p> Their minds, lately estranged, seemed suddenly to have been <lb n="2307" />
              drawn closer, one to the other. <lb n="2308" />
              <said who="???">&#8213;Do you believe in the eucharist? Cranly asked.<lb n="2309" /> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;I do not, Stephen said.<lb n="2310" /> </said>
              <said who="???">&#8213;Do you disbelieve then?<lb n="2311" /> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;I neither believe in it nor disbelieve in it, Stephen answered.<lb n="2312" /> </said>
              <said who="???">&#8213;Many persons have doubts, even religious persons, yet they <lb n="2313" />
              overcome them or put them aside, Cranly said. Are your <lb n="2314" />
              doubts on that point too strong?<lb n="2315" /> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;I do not wish to overcome them, Stephen answered.<lb n="2316" /></said> </p>
              <p> Cranly, embarrassed for a moment, took another fig from <lb n="2317" />
              his pocket and was about to eat it when Stephen said: <lb n="2318" />
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;Don't, please. You cannot discuss this question with your <lb n="2319" />
              mouth full of chewed  fig.<lb n="2320" /></said> </p>
              <p> Cranly examined the fig by the light of a lamp under which <lb n="2321" />
              he halted. Then he smelt it with both nostrils, bit a tiny piece, <lb n="2322" />
              spat it out and threw the fig rudely into the gutter. Addressing <lb n="2323" />
              it as it lay, he said: <lb n="2324" />
              <said who="???">&#8213;Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire!<lb n="2325" /></said> </p>
              <p> Taking Stephen's arm he went on again and said: <lb n="2326" />
              <said who="???">&#8213;Do you not fear that those words may be spoken to you on <lb n="2327" />
              the day of judgment?<lb n="2328" /> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;What is offered me on the other hand? Stephen asked. An <lb n="2329" />
              eternity of bliss in the company of the dean of studies?<lb n="2330" /> </said>
              <said who="???">&#8213;Remember, Cranly said, that he would be glorified.<lb n="2331" /> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;Ay, Stephen said somewhat bitterly. Bright, agile, impassible <lb n="2332" />
              and, above all, subtle.<lb n="2333" /> </said>
              <said who="???">&#8213;It is a curious thing, do you know, Cranly said dispassion- <lb n="2334" />
              ately, how your mind is supersaturated with the religion in <lb n="2335" />
              which you say you disbelieve. Did you believe in it when you <lb n="2336" />
              were at school? I bet you did.<lb n="2337" /> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;I did, Stephen answered.<lb n="2338" /> </said>
              <said who="???">&#8213;And were you happier then? Cranly asked softly. Happier <lb n="2339" />
              than you are now, for instance?<lb n="2340" /> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;Often happy, Stephen said, and often unhappy. I was some- <lb n="2341" />
              one else then.<lb n="2342" /> </said>
              <said who="???">&#8213;How someone else? What do you mean by that  statement?<lb n="2343" /> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;I mean, said Stephen, that I was not myself as I am now, as I <lb n="2344" />
              had to become.<lb n="2345" /> </said>
              <said who="???">&#8213;Not as you are now, not as you had to become, Cranly <lb n="2346" />
              repeated. Let me ask you a question. Do you love your mother?<lb n="2347" /></said> </p>
              <p> Stephen shook his head slowly. <lb n="2348" />
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;I don't know what your words mean, he said simply.<lb n="2349" /> </said>
              <said who="???">&#8213;Have you never loved anyone? Cranly asked.<lb n="2350" /> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;Do you mean women?<lb n="2351" /> </said>
              <said who="???">&#8213;I am not speaking of that, Cranly said in a colder tone. I ask <lb n="2352" />
              you if you ever felt love towards anyone or anything.<lb n="2353" /></said> </p>
              <p> Stephen walked on beside his friend, staring gloomily at the <lb n="2354" />
              footpath. <lb n="2355" />
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;I tried to love God, he said at length. It seems now I failed. It <lb n="2356" />
              is very difficult. I tried to unite my will with the will of God <lb n="2357" />
              instant by instant. In that I did not always fail. I could perhaps <lb n="2358" />
              do that still .....<lb n="2359" /></said> </p>
              <p> Cranly cut him short by asking: <lb n="2360" />
              <said who="???">&#8213;Has your mother had a happy life?<lb n="2361" /> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;How do I know? Stephen said.<lb n="2362" /> </said>
              <said who="???">&#8213;How many children had she?<lb n="2363" /> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;Nine or ten, Stephen answered. Some died.<lb n="2364" /> </said>
              <said who="???">&#8213;Was your father .... Cranly interrupted himself for an in- <lb n="2365" />
              stant: and then said: I don't want to pry  into your family <lb n="2366" />
              affairs. But was your father what is called  well-to-do? I mean <lb n="2367" />
              when you were growing up?<lb n="2368" /> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;Yes, Stephen said.<lb n="2369" /> </said>
              <said who="???">&#8213;What was he? Cranly asked after a pause.<lb n="2370" /></said> </p>
              <p> Stephen began to enumerate glibly his father's attributes. <lb n="2371" />
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;A medical student, an oarsman, a tenor, an amateur actor, a <lb n="2372" />
              shouting politician, a small landlord, a small investor, a <lb n="2373" />
              drinker, a good fellow, a storyteller, somebody's secretary, <lb n="2374" />
              something in a distillery, a taxgatherer, a bankrupt and at <lb n="2375" />
              present a praiser of his own past.<lb n="2376" /></said> </p>
              <p> Cranly laughed, tightening  his grip on Stephen's arm, and <lb n="2377" />
              said: <lb n="2378" />
              <said who="???">&#8213;The distillery is damn good.<lb n="2379" /> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;Is there anything else you want to know? Stephen asked.<lb n="2380" /> </said>
              <said who="???">&#8213;Are you in good circumstances at present?<lb n="2381" /> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;Do I look it? Stephen asked bluntly.<lb n="2382" /> </said>
              <said who="???">&#8213;So then, Cranly went on musingly, you were born in the lap <lb n="2383" />
              of luxury.<lb n="2384" /></said> </p>
              <p> He used the phrase broadly and loudly as he often used <lb n="2385" />
              technical expressions as if he wished his hearer to understand <lb n="2386" />
              that they were used by him without conviction. <lb n="2387" />
              <said who="???">&#8213;Your mother must have gone through a good deal of suffer- <lb n="2388" />
              ing, he said then. Would you not try to save her from suffering <lb n="2389" />
              more even if .... or would you?<lb n="2390" /> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;If I could, Stephen said. That would cost me very little.<lb n="2391" /> </said>
              <said who="???">&#8213;Then do so, Cranly said. Do as she wishes you to do. What <lb n="2392" />
              is it for you? You disbelieve in it. It is a form: nothing else. And <lb n="2393" />
              you will set her mind at rest.<lb n="2394" /></said> </p>
              <p> He ceased and, as Stephen did not reply, remained silent. <lb n="2395" />
              Then, as if giving utterance to the process of his own thought, <lb n="2396" />
              he said: <lb n="2397" />
              <said who="???">&#8213;Whatever else is unsure in this stinking dunghill of a world a <lb n="2398" />
              mother's love is not. Your mother brings you into the world, <lb n="2399" />
              carries you first in her body. What do we know about what she <lb n="2400" />
              feels? But whatever she feels, it, at least, must be real. It must <lb n="2401" />
              be. What are our ideas or ambitions? Play. Ideas! Why, that <lb n="2402" />
              bloody bleating goat Temple has ideas. MacCann has ideas too. <lb n="2403" />
              Every jackass going the  roads thinks he has ideas.<lb n="2404" /></said> </p>
              <p> Stephen, who had been listening to the unspoken speech <lb n="2405" />
              behind the words, said with  assumed carelessness: <lb n="2406" />
              <p> <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;Pascal, if I remember rightly, would not suffer his mother to <lb n="2407" />
              kiss him as he feared the contact of her sex.<lb n="2408" /> </said>
              <said who="???">&#8213;Pascal was a pig, said Cranly.<lb n="2409" /> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;Aloysius Gonzaga, I think, was of the same mind, Stephen <lb n="2410" />
              said.<lb n="2411" /> </said>
              <said who="???">&#8213;And he was another pig then, said Cranly.<lb n="2412" /> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;The church calls him a saint, Stephen objected.<lb n="2413" /> </said>
              <said who="???">&#8213;I don't care a flaming damn what anyone calls him, Cranly <lb n="2414" />
              said rudely and flatly. I call him a pig.<lb n="2415" /></said> </p>
              <p> Stephen, preparing the words neatly in his mind, continued: <lb n="2416" />
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;Jesus too seems to have treated his mother with scant cour- <lb n="2417" />
              tesy in public but Suarez, a jesuit theologian and Spanish <lb n="2418" />
              gentleman, has apologised for him.<lb n="2419" /> </said>
              <said who="???">&#8213;Did the idea ever occur to you, Cranly asked, that Jesus was <lb n="2420" />
              not what he pretended to be?<lb n="2421" /> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;The first person to whom that idea occurred,  Stephen <lb n="2422" />
              answered, was Jesus himself.<lb n="2423" /> </said>
              <said who="???">&#8213;I mean, Cranly said,  hardening in his speech, did the idea <lb n="2424" />
              ever occur to you that he was himself a conscious hypocrite, <lb n="2425" />
              what he called the jews of his time, a whited sepulchre? Or, to <lb n="2426" />
              put it more plainly, that he was a blackguard?<lb n="2427" /> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;That idea never occurred  to me, Stephen answered. But I am <lb n="2428" />
              curious to know are you trying to make a convert of me or a <lb n="2429" />
              pervert of yourself?<lb n="2430" /></said> </p>
              <p> He turned towards his friend's face and saw there a raw <lb n="2431" />
              smile which some force of will strove to make finely significant.<lb n="2432" /> </p>
              <p> Cranly asked suddenly in a plain sensible tone: <lb n="2433" />
              <said who="???">&#8213;Tell me the truth. Were you at all shocked by what I said?<lb n="2434" /> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;Somewhat, Stephen said.<lb n="2435" /> </said>
              <said who="???">&#8213;And why were you shocked, Cranly pressed on in the same <lb n="2436" />
              tone, if you feel sure that our religion is false and that Jesus <lb n="2437" />
              was not the son of God?<lb n="2438" /> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;I am not at all sure of it, Stephen said. He is more like a son <lb n="2439" />
              of God than a son of Mary.<lb n="2440" /> </said>
              <said who="???">&#8213;And is that why you will not communicate, Cranly asked, <lb n="2441" />
              because you are not sure of that too, because you feel that the <lb n="2442" />
              host too may be the body and blood of the son of God and not <lb n="2443" />
              a wafer of bread? And because you fear that it may be?<lb n="2444" /> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;Yes, Stephen said quietly. I feel that and I also fear it.<lb n="2445" /> </said>
              <said who="???">&#8213;I see, Cranly said.<lb n="2446" /></said> </p>
              <p> Stephen, struck by his tone of closure, reopened the dis- <lb n="2447" />
              cussion at once by saying: <lb n="2448" />
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;I fear many things: dogs, horses, firearms, the sea, thunder- <lb n="2449" />
              storms, machinery, the country roads at night.<lb n="2450" /> </said>
              <said who="???">&#8213;But why do you fear a bit of bread?<lb n="2451" /> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;I imagine, Stephen said, that there is a malevolent  reality <lb n="2452" />
              behind those things I say I fear.<lb n="2453" /> </said>
              <said who="???">&#8213;Do you fear then, Cranly asked, that the God of the Roman <lb n="2454" />
              catholics would strike you dead and damn you if you made a <lb n="2455" />
              sacrilegious communion?<lb n="2456" /> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;The God of the Roman catholics could do that now, Stephen <lb n="2457" />
              said. I fear more than that the chemical action which would be <lb n="2458" />
              set up in my soul by a false homage to a symbol behind which <lb n="2459" />
              are massed twenty centuries of authority and veneration.<lb n="2460" /> </said>
              <said who="???">&#8213;Would you, Cranly asked, in extreme danger commit that <lb n="2461" />
              particular sacrilege? For instance, if you lived in the penal days?<lb n="2462" /> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;I cannot answer for the past, Stephen replied. Possibly not.<lb n="2463" /> </said>
              <said who="???">&#8213;Then, said Cranly, you do not intend to become a protes- <lb n="2464" />
              tant?<lb n="2465" /> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;I said that I had lost the faith, Stephen answered, but not <lb n="2466" />
              that I had lost selfrespect. What kind of liberation would that <lb n="2467" />
              be to forsake an absurdity which is logical and coherent and to <lb n="2468" />
              embrace one which is illogical and incoherent?<lb n="2469" /></said> </p>
              <p> They had walked on towards the township of <place><location><geo>51.873620 -8.347738</geo></location><placeName>Pembroke</placeName></place> and <lb n="2470" />
              now, as they went on slowly along the avenues, the trees and <lb n="2471" />
              the scattered lights in the villas soothed their minds. The air of <lb n="2472" />
              wealth and repose diffused about them seemed to comfort their <lb n="2473" />
              neediness. Behind a hedge of laurel a light glimmered in the <lb n="2474" />
              window of a kitchen and the voice of a servant was heard <lb n="2475" />
              singing as she sharpened knives. She sang in short broken bars <lb n="2476" />
              <emph>Rosie O'Grady</emph>.<lb n="2477" /> </p>
              <p> Cranly stopped to listen, saying: <lb n="2478" />
              <said who="???">&#8213;<seg xml:lang="la">Mulier cantat.</seg><lb n="2479" /></said> </p>
              <p> The soft beauty of the Latin word touched with an enchant- <lb n="2480" />
              ing touch the  dark of the evening, with a touch fainter and <lb n="2481" />
              more persuading than the touch of music or of a woman's <lb n="2482" />
              hand. The strife of their minds was quelled. The figure of <lb n="2483" />
              woman as she appears in the liturgy of the church passed si- <lb n="2484" />
              lently through the darkness: a whiterobed figure, small and <lb n="2485" />
              slender as a boy and with a falling girdle. Her voice, frail and <lb n="2486" />
              high as a boy's, was heard intoning from a distant choir the <lb n="2487" />
              first words of a woman which pierce the gloom and clamour of <lb n="2488" />
              the first chanting of the passion: <lb n="2489" />
              <said who="???">&#8213;<seg xml:lang="la">Et tu cum Jesu Galilaeo eras.</seg><lb n="2490" /></said> </p>
              <p> And all  hearts were touched and turned to her voice, shining <lb n="2491" />
              like a young star, shining clearer as the voice intoned the pro- <lb n="2492" />
              paroxyton and more faintly as the cadence died.<lb n="2493" /> </p>
              <p> The singing ceased. They went on together, Cranly repeating <lb n="2494" />
              in strongly stressed rhythm the end of the refrain: <lb n="2495" />
              <lg>
                <l>And when we are married</l> <lb n="2496" />
                <l>O, how happy we'll be</l> <lb n="2497" />
                <l>For I love sweet Rosie O'Grady</l> <lb n="2498" />
                <l>And Rosie O'Grady loves me.</l> <lb n="2499" />
              </lg>
              <said who="???">&#8213;There's real poetry for you, he said. There's real love.<lb n="2500" /></said> </p>
              <p> He glanced sideways at Stephen with a strange smile and <lb n="2501" />
              said: <lb n="2502" />
              <said who="???">&#8213;Do you consider that poetry? Or do you know what the <lb n="2503" />
              words mean?<lb n="2504" /> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;I want to see Rosie first, said Stephen.<lb n="2505" /> </said>
              <said who="???">&#8213;She's easy to find, Cranly said.<lb n="2506" /></said> </p>
              <p> His hat had come down on his forehead. He shoved it back: <lb n="2507" />
              and in the shadow of the trees Stephen saw his pale face, <lb n="2508" />
              framed by the dark, and his large dark eyes. Yes. His face was <lb n="2509" />
              handsome: and his body was strong and hard. He had spoken <lb n="2510" />
              of a mother's love. He felt then the sufferings of women, the <lb n="2511" />
              weaknesses of their bodies and souls: and would shield them <lb n="2512" />
              with a strong  and resolute arm and bow his mind to them.<lb n="2513" /> </p>
              <p> Away then: it is time to go. A voice spoke softly to Stephen's <lb n="2514" />
              lonely heart, bidding him go and telling him that his friendship <lb n="2515" />
              was coming to an end. Yes: he would go. He could not strive <lb n="2516" />
              against another. He knew his part. <lb n="2517" />
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;Probably I shall go away, he said.<lb n="2518" /> </said>
              <said who="???">&#8213;Where? Cranly asked.<lb n="2519" /> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;Where I can, Stephen said.<lb n="2520" /> </said>
              <said who="???">&#8213;Yes, Cranly said. It might be difficult for you to live here <lb n="2521" />
              now. But is it that that makes you go?<lb n="2522" /> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;I have to go, Stephen answered.<lb n="2523" /></said> </p>
              <said who="???">&#8213;Because, Cranly continued, you need not look upon yourself <lb n="2524" />
              as driven away if you do not wish to go or as a heretic or an <lb n="2525" />
              outlaw. There are many good believers who think as you do. <lb n="2526" />
              Would that surprise you? The church is not the stone building <lb n="2527" />
              nor even the clergy and their dogmas. It is the whole mass of <lb n="2528" />
              those born into it. I don't know what you wish to do in life. Is <lb n="2529" />
              it what you told me the night we were standing outside <place><location><geo>53.333446 -6.262433</geo></location><placeName>Har- <lb n="2530" />
              court Street station</placeName></place>?<lb n="2531" /> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;Yes, Stephen said, smiling in spite of himself at Cranly's way <lb n="2532" />
              of remembering thoughts in connection with places. The night <lb n="2533" />
              you spent half an hour wrangling with Doherty about the <lb n="2534" />
              shortest way from <place><location><geo>53.136900 -6.310000</geo></location><placeName>Sallygap</placeName></place> to Larras.<lb n="2535" /> </said>
              <said who="???">&#8213;Pothead! Cranly said with calm contempt. What does he <lb n="2536" />
              know about the way from Sallygap to Larras? Or what does he <lb n="2537" />
              know about anything for that matter? And the big slobbering <lb n="2538" />
              washingpot head of him!<lb n="2539" /></said> </p>
              <p> He broke out into a loud long laugh. <lb n="2540" />
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;Well? Stephen said. Do you remember the rest?<lb n="2541" /> </said>
              <said who="???">&#8213;What you said, is it? Cranly asked. Yes, I remember it. To <lb n="2542" />
              discover the mode of life or of art whereby your spirit could <lb n="2543" />
              express itself in unfettered freedom.<lb n="2544" /></said> </p>
              <p> Stephen raised his hat in acknowledgment. <lb n="2545" />
              <said who="???">&#8213;Freedom! Cranly repeated. But you are not free enough yet <lb n="2546" />
              to commit a sacrilege. Tell me, would you rob?<lb n="2547" /> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;I would beg first, Stephen said.<lb n="2548" /> </said>
              <said who="???">&#8213;And if you got  nothing would you rob?<lb n="2549" /> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;You wish me to say, Stephen answered, that the rights of <lb n="2550" />
              property are provisional and that in certain circumstances it is <lb n="2551" />
              not unlawful to rob. Everyone would act in that belief. So I will <lb n="2552" />
              not make you that answer. Apply to the jesuit theologian Juan <lb n="2553" />
              Mariana de Talavera who will also explain to you in what <lb n="2554" />
              circumstances you may lawfully kill your king and whether you <lb n="2555" />
              had better hand him his poison in a goblet or smear it for him <lb n="2556" />
              upon his robe or his saddlebow. Ask me rather would I suffer <lb n="2557" />
              others to rob me or, if they did, would I call down upon them <lb n="2558" />
              what I believe is called the chastisement of the secular arm.<lb n="2559" /> </said>
              <said who="???">&#8213;And would you?<lb n="2560" /> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;I think, Stephen said, it would pain me as much to do so as <lb n="2561" />
              to be robbed.<lb n="2562" /> </said>
              <said who="???">&#8213;I see, Cranly said.<lb n="2563" /></said> </p>
              <p> He produced his match and began to clean the crevice be- <lb n="2564" />
              tween two teeth. Then he said carelessly: <lb n="2565" />
              <said who="???">&#8213;Tell me, for example, would you deflower a virgin?<lb n="2566" /> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;Excuse me, Stephen said politely. Is that not the ambition of <lb n="2567" />
              most young gentlemen?<lb n="2568" /> </said>
              <said who="???">&#8213;What then is your point of view? Cranly asked.<lb n="2569" /></said> </p>
              <p> His last phrase, soursmelling as the smoke of charcoal and <lb n="2570" />
              disheartening, excited Stephen's brain over which its fumes <lb n="2571" />
              seemed to brood. <lb n="2572" />
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;Look here, Cranly, he said. You have asked me what I would <lb n="2573" />
              do and what I would not do. I will tell you what I will do and <lb n="2574" />
              what I will not do. I will not serve that in which I no longer <lb n="2575" />
              believe whether it call itself my home, my fatherland or my <lb n="2576" />
              church: and I will try to express myself in some mode of life or <lb n="2577" />
              art as freely as I can and as wholly as I can, using for my <lb n="2578" />
              defence the only arms I allow myself to use, - silence, exile and <lb n="2579" />
              cunning.<lb n="2580" /></said> </p>
              <p> Cranly seized his arm and steered him round so as to lead <lb n="2581" />
              him back towards <place><location><geo>53.328562 -6.251897</geo></location><placeName>Leeson Park</placeName></place>. He laughed almost slily and <lb n="2582" />
              pressed Stephen's arm with an elder's affection. <lb n="2583" />
              <said who="???">&#8213;Cunning indeed! he said. Is it you? You poor poet, you!<lb n="2584" /> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;And you made me confess to you, Stephen said, thrilled by <lb n="2585" />
              his touch, as I have confessed to you so  many other things, <lb n="2586" />
              have I not?<lb n="2587" /> </said>
              <said who="???">&#8213;Yes, my child, Cranly said, still gaily.<lb n="2588" /> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;You made me confess the fears that I have. But I will tell you <lb n="2589" />
              also what I do not fear. I do not fear to be alone or to be <lb n="2590" />
              spurned for another or to leave whatever I have to leave. And I <lb n="2591" />
              am not afraid to make a mistake, even  a great  mistake, a <lb n="2592" />
              lifelong mistake and perhaps as long as eternity too.<lb n="2593" /></said> </p>
              <p> Cranly, now grave again, slowed his pace and said: <lb n="2594" />
              <said who="???">&#8213;Alone, quite alone. You have no fear of that. And you know <lb n="2595" />
              what that word means? Not only to be separate from all others <lb n="2596" />
              but to have not even one friend.<lb n="2597" /> </said>
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;I will take the risk, said Stephen.<lb n="2598" /> </said>
              <said who="???">&#8213;And not to have any one person, Cranly said, who would be <lb n="2599" />
              more than a friend, more even than the noblest and truest <lb n="2600" />
              friend a man ever had.<lb n="2601" /></said> </p>
              <p> His words seemed to have struck some deep chord in his <lb n="2602" />
              own nature. Had he spoken of himself, of himself as he was or <lb n="2603" />
              wished to be? Stephen watched his face for some moments in <lb n="2604" />
              silence. A cold sadness was there. He had spoken of himself, of <lb n="2605" />
              his own loneliness which he feared. <lb n="2606" />
              <said who="Stephen Dedalus">&#8213;Of whom are you speaking? Stephen asked at length.<lb n="2607" /></said> </p>
              <p> Cranly did not answer.<lb n="2608" /> </p>

              <p> <emph>20 March:</emph> Long talk with Cranly on the subject of my re- <lb n="2609" />
              volt. He had his grand manner on. I supple and suave. Attacked <lb n="2610" />
              me on the score of love for one's mother. Tried to imagine his <lb n="2611" />
              mother: cannot. Told me once, in a moment of thoughtlessness, <lb n="2612" />
              his father was sixtyone when he was born. Can see him. Strong <lb n="2613" />
              farmer type. Pepper and salt suit. Square feet. Unkempt <lb n="2614" />
              grizzled beard. Probably attends coursing matches. Pays his <lb n="2615" />
              dues regularly but not plentifully to Father Dwyer of Larras. <lb n="2616" />
              Sometimes talks to girls after nightfall. But his mother? Very <lb n="2617" />
              young or very old? Hardly the first. If so, Cranly would not <lb n="2618" />
              have spoken as he did. Old then. Probably: and neglected. <lb n="2619" />
              Hence Cranly's despair of soul: the child of exhausted loins.<lb n="2620" /> </p>
              <p> <emph>21 March, morning:</emph> Thought this in bed last night but was <lb n="2621" />
              too lazy and free to add it. Free, yes. The exhausted loins are <lb n="2622" />
              those of Elizabeth and Zachary. Then is he [is] the precursor. Item: <lb n="2623" />
              he eats chiefly belly bacon and dried figs. Read locusts and wild <lb n="2624" />
              honey. Also, when thinking of him, saw always a stern severed <lb n="2625" />
              head or deathmask as if outlined on a grey curtain or veronica. <lb n="2626" />
              Decollation they call it in the fold. Puzzled for the moment by <lb n="2627" />
              saint John at the Latin gate. What do I see? A decollated <lb n="2628" />
              precursor trying to pick the lock.<lb n="2629" /> </p>
              <p> <emph>21 March, night:</emph> Free. Soulfree and fancyfree. Let the dead <lb n="2630" />
              bury the dead. Ay. And let the dead marry the dead.<lb n="2631" /> </p>
              <p> <emph>22 March:</emph> In company with Lynch followed a sizable hos- <lb n="2632" />
              pital nurse. Lynch's idea. Dislike it. Two lean hungry grey- <lb n="2633" />
              hounds walking after a heifer.<lb n="2634" /> </p>
              <p> <emph>23 March:</emph> Have not seen her since that night. Unwell? Sits at <lb n="2635" />
              the fire perhaps with mamma's shawl on her shoulders. But not <lb n="2636" />
              peevish. A nice bowl of gruel? Won't you now?<lb n="2637" /> </p>
              <p> <emph>24 March:</emph> Began with a discussion with my mother. Subject: <lb n="2638" />
              B. V. M. Handicapped by my sex and youth. To escape held up <lb n="2639" />
              relations between Jesus and Papa against those between Mary <lb n="2640" />
              and her son. Said religion is not a lying-in hospital. Mother <lb n="2641" />
              indulgent. Said I have a queer mind and have read too much. <lb n="2642" />
              Not true. Have read little and understood less. Then she said I <lb n="2643" />
              would come back to faith because I had a restless mind. This <lb n="2644" />
              means to leave church by backdoor of sin and reenter through <lb n="2645" />
              the skylight of repentance. Cannot repent. Told her so and <lb n="2646" />
              asked for sixpence. Got threepence.<lb n="2647" /> </p>
              <p> Then went to college. Other wrangle with little roundhead <lb n="2648" />
              rogue's eye Ghezzi. This time about Bruno the Nolan. Began in <lb n="2649" />
              Italian and ended in pidgin English. He said Bruno was a ter- <lb n="2650" />
              rible heretic. I said he was terribly burned. He agreed to this <lb n="2651" />
              with some sorrow. Then gave me recipe for what he calls <lb n="2652" />
              <emph>risotto alla bergamasca</emph>. When he pronounces a soft <emph>o</emph> he pro- <lb n="2653" />
              trudes his full carnal lips as if he kissed the vowel. Has he? And <lb n="2654" />
              could he repent? Yes, he could: and cry two round rogue's <lb n="2655" />
              tears, one from each eye.<lb n="2656" /> </p>

              countrymen and not mine had invented what Cranly the other <lb n="2658" />
              night called our religion. A quartet of them, soldiers  of the <lb n="2659" />
              ninetyseventh infantry regiment, sat at the foot of the cross and <lb n="2660" />
              tossed up dice for the overcoat of the crucified.<lb n="2661" /> </p>
              <p> Went to library. Tried to read three reviews. Useless. She is <lb n="2662" />
              not out yet. Am I alarmed? About what? That she will never be <lb n="2663" />
              out again. Blake wrote:<lb n="2664" /> </p>
              <lg>

              <p> <emph>25 March, morning:</emph> A troubled night of dreams. Want to get <lb n="2672" />
              them off my chest.<lb n="2673" /> </p>
              <p> A long curving gallery. From the floor ascend pillars of dark <lb n="2674" />
              vapours. It is peopled by the images of fabulous kings, set in <lb n="2675" />
              stone. Their hands are folded upon their knees in token of <lb n="2676" />
              weariness and their eyes are darkened for the errors of men go <lb n="2677" />
              up before them for ever as dark vapours.<lb n="2678" /> </p>
              <p> Strange figures advance from a cave. They are not as tall as <lb n="2679" />
              men. One does not seem to stand quite apart from another. <lb n="2680" />
              Their faces are phosphorescent, with darker streaks. They peer <lb n="2681" />
              at me and their eyes seem to ask me something. They do not <lb n="2682" />
              speak.<lb n="2683" /> </p>
              <p> <emph>30 March:</emph> This evening Cranly was in the porch of the <lb n="2684" />
              library, proposing a problem to Dixon and her brother. A <lb n="2685" />
              mother let her child fall into the Nile. Still harping on the <lb n="2686" />
              mother. A crocodile seized the child. Mother asked it back. <lb n="2687" />
              Crocodile said all right if she told him what he was going to do <lb n="2688" />
              with the child, eat it or not eat it.<lb n="2689" /> </p>
              <p> This mentality, Lepidus would say, is indeed bred out of <lb n="2690" />
              your mud by the operation of your sun.<lb n="2691" /> </p>
              <p> And mine? Is it not too? Then into Nilemud with it!<lb n="2692" /> </p>
              <p> <emph>1 April:</emph> Disapprove of this last phrase.<lb n="2693" /> </p>
              <p> <emph>2 April:</emph> Saw her drinking tea and eating cakes in Johnston, <lb n="2694" />
              Mooney and O'Brien's. Rather, lynxeyed Lynch saw her as we <lb n="2695" />
              passed. He tells me Cranly was invited there by brother. Did he <lb n="2696" />
              bring his crocodile? Is he the shining light now? Well, I dis- <lb n="2697" />
              covered him. I protest I did. Shining quietly behind a bushel of <place><location><geo>52.979861 -6.048263</geo></location> <lb n="2698" />
              <placeName>Wicklow</placeName></place> bran.<lb n="2699" /> </p>
              <p> <emph>3 April:</emph> Met Davin at the <place><location><geo>53.353437 -6.261749</geo></location><placeName>cigar shop opposite Findlater's <lb n="2700" />
              church</placeName></place>. He was in a black sweater and had a hurleystick. <lb n="2701" />
              Asked me was it true I was going away and why. Told him the <lb n="2702" />
              shortest way to <place><location><geo>53.412910 -8.243890</geo></location><placeName>Tara</placeName></place> was <lb n="2703" />
              <place><location><geo>53.309441 -4.633038</geo></location><placeName>Holyhead</placeName></place>. Just then my father
              came up. Introduction. Father polite and observant. Asked <lb n="2704" />
              Davin if he might offer him some refreshment. Davin could <lb n="2705" />
              not, was going to a meeting. When we came away father told <lb n="2706" />
              me he had a good honest eye. Asked me why I did not join a <lb n="2707" />
              rowing club. I pretended to think it over. Told me then how he <lb n="2708" />
              broke Pennyfeather's heart. Wants me to read law. Says I was <lb n="2709" />
              cut out for that. More mud, more crocodiles.<lb n="2710" /> </p>
              <p> <emph>5 April:</emph> Wild spring. Scudding clouds. O life! Dark stream of <lb n="2711" />
              swirling bogwater on which appletrees have cast down their <lb n="2712" />
              delicate flowers. Eyes of girls among the leaves. Girls demure <lb n="2713" />
              and romping. All fair or auburn: no dark ones. They blush <lb n="2714" />
              better. Houp-la!<lb n="2715" /> </p>
              <p> <emph>6 April:</emph> Certainly she remembers the past. Lynch says all <lb n="2716" />
              women do. Then she remembers the time of her childhood &#8211; <lb n="2717" />
              and mine if I was ever a child. The past is consumed in the <lb n="2718" />
              present and the present is living only because it brings forth the <lb n="2719" />
              future. Statues of women, if Lynch be right, should always be <lb n="2720" />
              fully draped, one hand of the woman feeling regretfully her <lb n="2721" />
              own hinder parts.<lb n="2722" /> </p>
              <p> <emph>6 April: later:</emph> Michael Robartes remembers forgotten beauty <lb n="2723" />
              and, when his arms wrap her round, he presses in his arms the <lb n="2724" />
              loveliness which has long faded from the world. Not this. Not <lb n="2725" />
              at all. I desire to press in my arms the loveliness which has not <lb n="2726" />
              yet come into the world.<lb n="2727" /> </p>
              <p> 10 April:<emph /> Faintly, under the heavy night, through  the silence <lb n="2728" />
              of the city which has turned from dreams to dreamless sleep as <lb n="2729" />
              a weary lover whom no caresses move, the sound of hoofs <lb n="2730" />
              upon the road. Not so faintly now as they come near the <lb n="2731" />
              bridge; and in a moment as they pass the darkened windows <lb n="2732" />
              the silence is cloven by alarm as by an arrow. They are heard <lb n="2733" />
              now far away, hoofs that shine amid the heavy  night as gems, <lb n="2734" />
              hurrying beyond the sleeping fields to what journey's end &#8211; <lb n="2735" />
              what heart? &#8211; bearing what tidings?<lb n="2736" /> </p>
              <p> <emph>11 April:</emph> Read what I wrote last night. Vague words for a <lb n="2737" />
              vague emotion. Would she like it? I think so. Then I should <lb n="2738" />
              have to like it also.<lb n="2739" /> </p>
              <p> <emph>13 April:</emph> That tundish has been on my mind for a long time. <lb n="2740" />
              I looked it up and find it is English and good old blunt English <lb n="2741" />
              too. Damn the dean of studies and his funnel! What did he <lb n="2742" />
              come here for to teach us his own language or to learn it from <lb n="2743" />
              us. Damn him one way or the other!<lb n="2744" /> </p>
              <p> <emph>14 April:</emph> John Alphonsus Mulrennan has just returned from <lb n="2745" />
              the west of Ireland (European and Asiatic papers please copy). <lb n="2746" />
              He told us he met an old man there in a mountain cabin. Old <lb n="2747" />
              man had red eyes and short pipe. Old man spoke Irish. <lb n="2748" />
              Mulrennan spoke Irish. Then old man and Mulrennan spoke <lb n="2749" />
              English. Mulrennan spoke to him about universe and stars. Old <lb n="2750" />
              man sat, listened, smoked, spat. Then said: <lb n="2751" />
              <said who="???">&#8213;Ah, there must be terrible queer creatures at the latter end of <lb n="2752" />
              the world.<lb n="2753" /></said> </p>
              <p> I fear him. I fear his redrimmed horny eyes. It is with him I <lb n="2754" />
              must struggle all through this night till day come, till he or I lie <lb n="2755" />
              dead, gripping him by the sinewy throat till .... Till what? Till <lb n="2756" />
              he yield to me? No. I mean him no harm.<lb n="2757" /> </p>
              <p> <emph>15 April:</emph> Met her today pointblank in <place><location><geo>53.342556 -6.259573</geo></location><placeName>Grafton Street</placeName></place>. The <lb n="2758" />
              crowd brought us together. We both stopped. She asked me <lb n="2759" />
              why I never came, said she had heard all sorts of stories about <lb n="2760" />
              me. This was only to gain time. Asked me was I writing poems. <lb n="2761" />
              About whom? I asked her. This confused her more and I felt <lb n="2762" />
              sorry and mean. Turned off that valve at once and opened the <lb n="2763" />
              spiritual-heroic refrigerating apparatus, invented and patented <lb n="2764" />
              in all countries by Dante Alighieri. Talked rapidly of myself <lb n="2765" />
              and my plans. In the midst of it unluckily I made a sudden <lb n="2766" />
              gesture of a revolutionary nature. I must have looked like a <lb n="2767" />
              fellow throwing a handful of peas up into the air. People began <lb n="2768" />
              to look at us.  She shook hands a moment after and, in going <lb n="2769" />
              away, said she hoped I would do what I said.<lb n="2770" /> </p>
              <p> Now I call that friendly, don't you?<lb n="2771" /> </p>
              <p> Yes. I liked her today. A little or much? Don't know. I liked <lb n="2772" />
              her &#8211; and it seems a new feeling to me. Then, in that case, all <lb n="2773" />
              the rest, all that I thought I thought and all that I felt I felt, all <lb n="2774" />
              the rest before now, in fact ...... O, give it up, old chap! Sleep it <lb n="2775" />
              off!<lb n="2776" /> </p>
              <p> <emph>16 April:</emph> Away! Away!<lb n="2777" /> </p>
              <p> The spell of arms and voices: the white arms of roads, their <lb n="2778" />
              promise of close embraces and the black arms of tall ships that <lb n="2779" />
              stand against the moon, their tale of distant nations. They are <lb n="2780" />
              held out to say: We are alone. Come. And the voices say with <lb n="2781" />
              them: We are your kinsmen.  And  the air is thick with their <lb n="2782" />
              company as they call to me, their kinsman, making ready to go, <lb n="2783" />
              shaking the wings of their exultant and terrible youth.<lb n="2784" /> </p>
              <p> <emph>26 April:</emph> Mother is putting my new secondhand clothes in <lb n="2785" />
              order. She prays now, she says, that I may learn in my own life <lb n="2786" />
              and away from home and friends what the heart is and what it <lb n="2787" />
              feels. Amen. So be it. Welcome, O life! I go to encounter for the <lb n="2788" />
              millionth time the reality of experience and to forge in the <lb n="2789" />
              smithy of my soul the uncreated conscience of my race.<lb n="2790" /> </p>
              <p> <emph>27 April:</emph> Old father, old artificer, stand me now and ever in <lb n="2791" />
              good stead.<lb n="2792" /> </p>
