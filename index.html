<p class="textParagraph"> Once upon a time and a very good time it was there was a

<p class="textParagraph"> His father told him that story: his father looked at him

<p class="textParagraph">  Uncle Charles and  Dante clapped. They were older than his

<p class="textParagraph"> Dante had two brushes in her press. The brush with the
 maroon velvet back was for  Michael Davitt and the brush with
 the green velvet back was for  Parnell.  Dante gave him a cachou

<p class="textParagraph"> The wide playgrounds were swarming with boys. All were
 shouting and the prefects urged them on with strong cries. The
 evening air was pale and chilly and after every charge and thud
 of the footballers the greasy leather orb flew like a heavy bird
 through the grey light. He kept on the fringe of his line, out of
 sight of his prefect, out of the reach of the rude feet, feigning to
 run now and then. He felt his body small and weak amid the
 throng of players and his eyes were weak and watery.  Rody
 Kickham was not like that: he would be captain of the third
 line all the fellows said.</p>
<p class="textParagraph">  Rody Kickham was a decent fellow but  Nasty Roche was a
 stink.  Rody Kickham had greaves in his number and a hamper
 in the refectory.  Nasty Roche had big hands. He called the
 Friday pudding dog-in-the-blanket. And one day he had asked:</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Nasty Roche</span>―What is your name? </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph"> Stephen had answered:</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen</span>―  Stephen Dedalus. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph"> Then  Nasty Roche had said:</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Nasty Roche</span>―What kind of a name is that? </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph"> And when  Stephen had not been able to answer  Nasty
 Roche had asked:</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Nasty Roche</span>―What is your father? </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  Stephen had answered:</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen</span>―A gentleman. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph"> Then  Nasty Roche had asked:</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Nasty Roche</span>―Is he a magistrate? </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph"> He crept about from point to point on the fringe of his line,
 making little runs now and then. But his hands were bluish
 with cold. He kept his hands in the sidepockets of his belted
 grey suit. That was a belt round his jacket. And belt was also to
 give a fellow a belt. One day a fellow had said to  Cantwell:</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">a fellow</span>―I'd give you such a belt in a second. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  Cantwell had answered:</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Cantwell</span>―Go and fight your match. Give  Cecil Thunder a belt. I'd like
 to see you. He'd give you a toe in the rump for yourself. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph"> That was not a nice expression. His mother had told him
 not to speak with the rough boys in the college. Nice mother!
 The first day in the hall of the castle when she had said good-
 bye she had put up her veil double to her nose to kiss him: and
 her nose and eyes were red. But he had pretended not to see
 that she was going to cry. She was a nice mother but she was
 not so nice when she cried. And his father had given him two
  fiveshilling  pieces for pocket money. And his father had told
 him if he wanted anything to write home to him and, whatever
 he did, never to peach on a fellow. Then at the door of the
 castle the rector had shaken hands with his father and mother,
 his soutane fluttering in the breeze, and the car had driven off
 with his father and mother on it. They had cried to him from
 the car, waving their hands:</p>
<p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mary Dedalus, Simon Dedalus</span>
<p class="textParagraph">―Goodbye,  Stephen, goodbye!</p>
<p class="textParagraph">―Goodbye,  Stephen, goodbye!</p>
</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> He was caught in the whirl of a scrimmage and, fearful of
 the flashing eyes and muddy boots, bent down to look through
 the legs. The fellows were struggling and groaning and their
 legs were rubbing and kicking and stamping. Then  Jack
 Lawton's yellow boots dodged out the ball and all the other
 boots and legs ran after. He ran after them a little way and then
 stopped. It was useless to run on. Soon they would be going
 home for the holidays. After supper in the  studyhall  he would
 change the number pasted up inside his desk from  seventyseven 
 to  seventysix .</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> It would be better to be in the  studyhall  than out there in the
 cold. The sky was pale and cold but there were lights in the
 castle. He wondered from which window  Hamilton Rowan
 had thrown his hat on the haha and had there been flowerbeds
 at that time under the windows. One day when he had been
 called to the castle the butler had shown him the marks of the
 soldiers' slugs in the wood of the door and had given him a
 piece of shortbread that the community ate. It was nice and
 warm to see the lights in the castle. It was like something in a
 book. Perhaps   <span class="hide"> 52.640379 -1.132563 </span>   Leicester Abbey   was like that. And there were
 nice sentences in  Doctor Cornwell's Spelling Book. They were
 like poetry but they were only sentences to learn the spelling
 from.</p>
<p class="lg">
  <span class="emph">  Wolsey died in   <span class="hide"> 52.640379 -1.132563 </span>   Leicester Abbey   </span> <br>
  <span class="emph"> Where the abbots buried him. </span> <br>
  <span class="emph"> Canker is a disease of plants, </span> <br>
  <span class="emph"> Cancer one of animals. </span> <br>
</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> It would be nice to lie on the hearthrug before the fire,
 leaning his head upon his hands, and think on those sentences.
 He shivered as if he had cold slimy water next his skin. That
 was mean of  Wells to shoulder him into the square ditch be-
 cause he would not swop his little  snuffbox  for  Wells 's sea-
 soned hacking chestnut, the conqueror of forty. How cold and
 slimy the water had been! A fellow had once seen a big rat
 jump plop into the scum. He shivered and longed to cry. It
 would be so nice to be at home. Mother was sitting at the fire
 with  Dante  waiting for  Brigid  to bring in the tea. She had her
 feet on the fender and her jewelly slippers were so hot and they
 had such a lovely warm smell!  Dante  knew a lot of things. She
 had taught him where the   <span class="hide"> -18.615949 41.280858 </span>   Mozambique Channel   was and what
 was   <span class="hide"> 38.627003 -90.199404 </span>   the longest river in America   and what was the name of the
 highest mountain in the moon.  Father Arnall  knew more than
  Dante  because he was a priest but both his father and  uncle
 Charles  said that  Dante  was a clever woman and a  wellread 
 woman. And when  Dante  made that noise after dinner and
 then put up her hand to her mouth: that was heartburn.</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> A voice cried far out on the playground:</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">a voice</span>―All in! </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph"> Then other voices cried from the lower and third lines:</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">other voices from the lower and third lines</span>―All in! All in! </p> </p>
<p class="textParagraph"> The players closed around, flushed and muddy, and he went
 among them, glad to go in.  Rody Kickham  held the ball by its
 greasy lace. A fellow asked him to give it one last: but he
 walked on without even answering the fellow.  Simon Moonan 
 told him not to because the prefect was looking. The fellow
 turned to  Simon Moonan  and said:</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">a fellow</span>―We all know why you speak. You are  McGlade 's suck. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph"> Suck was a queer word. The fellow called  Simon Moonan 
 that name because  Simon Moonan  used to tie the prefect's false
 sleeves behind his back and the prefect used to let on to be
 angry. But the sound was ugly. Once he had washed his hands
 in the lavatory of the   <span class="hide"> 53.342872 -6.260651 </span>   Wicklow Hotel   and his father pulled the
 stopper up by the chain after and the dirty water went down
 through the hole in the basin. And when it had all gone down
 slowly the hole in the basin had made a sound like that: suck.
 Only louder.</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> To remember that and the white look of the lavatory made
 him feel cold and then hot. There were two cocks that you
 turned and water came out: cold and hot. He felt cold and then
 a little hot: and he could see the names printed on the cocks.
 That was a very queer thing.</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> And the air in the corridor chilled him too. It was queer and
 wettish. But soon the gas would be lit and in burning it made a
 light noise like a little song. Always the same: and when the
 fellows stopped talking in the playroom you could hear it.</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> It was the hour for sums.  Father Arnall  wrote a hard sum on
 the board and then said:</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Arnall</span>―Now then, who will win? Go ahead, York! Go ahead, Lan-
 caster! </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  Stephen  tried his best but the sum was too hard and he felt
 confused. The little silk badge with the white rose on it that
 was pinned on the breast of his jacket began to flutter. He was
 no good at sums but he tried his best so that York might not
 lose.  Father Arnall 's face looked very black but he was not in a
 wax: he was laughing. Then  Jack Lawton  cracked his fingers
 and  Father Arnall  looked at his copybook and said:</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Arnall</span>―Right. Bravo Lancaster! The red rose wins. Come on now,
 York! Forge ahead! </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  Jack Lawton  looked over from his side. The little silk badge
 with the red rose on it looked very rich because he had a blue
 sailor top on.  Stephen  felt his own face red too, thinking of all
 the bets about who would get first place in elements,  Jack
 Lawton  or he. Some weeks  Jack Lawton  got the card for first
 and some weeks he got the card for first. His white silk badge
 fluttered and fluttered as he worked at the next sum and heard
  Father Arnall 's voice. Then all his eagerness passed away and
 he felt his face quite cool. He thought his face must be white
 because it felt so cool. He could not get out the answer for the
 sum but it did not matter. White roses and red roses: those
 were beautiful colours to think of. And the cards for first place
 and second place and third place were beautiful colours too:
 pink and cream and lavender. Lavender and cream and pink
 roses were beautiful to think of. Perhaps a wild rose might be
 like those colours: and he remembered the song about the wild
 rose blossoms on the little green place. But you could not have
 a green rose. But perhaps somewhere in the world you could.</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> The bell rang and then the classes began to file out of the
 rooms and along the corridors towards the refectory. He sat
 looking at the two prints of butter on his plate but could not
 eat the damp bread. The tablecloth was damp and limp. But he
 drank off the hot weak tea which the clumsy scullion, girt with
 a white apron, poured into his cup. He wondered whether the
 scullion's apron was damp too or whether all white things were
 cold and damp.  Nasty Roche  and  Saurin  drank cocoa that their
 people sent them in tins. They said they could not drink the tea;
 that it was hogwash. Their fathers were magistrates, the fel-
 lows said.</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> All the boys seemed to him very strange. They had all fa-
 thers and mothers and different clothes and voices. He longed
 to be at home and lay his head on his mother's lap. But he
 could not: and so he longed for the play and study and prayers
 to be over and to be in bed.</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> He drank another cup of hot tea and  Fleming  said:</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Fleming</span>―What's up? Have you a pain or what's up with you? </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph"> <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen</span>―I don't know,  Stephen  said. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph"> <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Fleming</span>―Sick in your breadbasket,  Fleming  said, because your face
 looks white. It will go away. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph"> <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen</span>―O yes,  Stephen  said. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph"> But he was not sick there. He thought that he was sick in his
 heart if you could be sick in that place.  Fleming  was very
 decent to ask him. He wanted to cry. He leaned his elbows on
 the table and shut and opened the flaps of his ears. Then he
 heard the noise of the refectory every time he opened the flaps
 of his ears. It made a roar like a train at night. And when he
 closed the flaps the roar was shut off like a train going into a
 tunnel. That night at   <span class="hide"> 53.277911 -6.105844 </span>   Dalkey   the train had roared like that and
 then, when it went into the tunnel, the roar stopped. He closed
 his eyes and the train went on, roaring and then stopping;
 roaring again, stopping. It was nice to hear it roar and stop and
 then roar out of the tunnel again and then stop.</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> Then the higher line fellows began to come down along the
 matting in the middle of the refectory,  Paddy Rath  and  Jimmy
 Magee  and the Spaniard who was allowed to smoke cigars and
 the little Portuguese who wore the woolly cap. And then the
 lower line tables and the tables of the third line. And every
 single fellow had a different way of walking.</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> He sat in a corner of the playroom pretending to watch a
 game of dominos and once or twice he was able to hear for an
 instant the little song of the gas. The prefect was at the door
 with some boys and  Simon Moonan  was knotting his false
 sleeves. He was telling them something about   <span class="hide"> 52.888640 -8.428450 </span>   Tullabeg  .</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> Then he went away from the door and  Wells  came over to
  Stephen  and said:</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Wells</span>―Tell us,  Dedalus , do you kiss your mother every night before
 you go to bed? </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  Stephen  answered:</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen</span>―I do. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  Wells  turned to the other fellows and said:</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Wells</span>―O, I say, here's a fellow says he kisses his mother every night
 before he goes to bed. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph"> The other fellows stopped their game and turned round,
 laughing.  Stephen  blushed under their eyes and said:</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen</span>―I do not. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  Wells  said:</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Wells</span>―O, I say, here's a fellow says he doesn't kiss his mother
 before he goes to bed. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph"> They all laughed again.  Stephen  tried to laugh with them.
 He felt his whole body hot and confused in a moment. What
 was the right answer to the question? He had given two and
 still  Wells  laughed. But  Wells  must know the right answer for
 he was in third of grammar. He tried to think of  Wells 's mother
 but he did not dare to raise his eyes to  Wells 's face. He did not
 like  Wells 's face. It was  Wells  who had shouldered him into the
 square ditch the day before because he would not swop his
 little  snuffbox  for  Wells 's seasoned hacking chestnut, the con-
 queror of forty. It was a mean thing to do; all the fellows said it
 was. And how cold and slimy the water had been! And a fellow
 had once seen a big rat jump plop into the scum.</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> The cold slime of the ditch covered his whole body; and,
 when the bell rang for study and the lines filed out of the
 playrooms, he felt the cold air of the corridor and staircase
 inside his clothes. He still tried to think what was the right
 answer. Was it right to kiss his mother or wrong to kiss his
 mother? What did that mean, to kiss? You put your face up like
 that to say goodnight and then his mother put her face down.
 That was to kiss. His mother put her lips on his cheek; her lips
 were soft and they wetted his cheek; and they made a tiny little
 noise: kiss. Why did people do that with their two faces?</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> Sitting in the  studyhall  he opened the lid of his desk and
 changed the number pasted up inside from  seventyseven  to
  seventysix . But the Christmas vacation was very far away: but
 one time it would come because the earth moved round always.</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> There was a picture of the earth on the first page of his
 geography: a big ball in the middle of clouds.  Fleming  had a
 box of crayons and one night during free study he had coloured
 the earth green and the clouds maroon. That was like the two
 brushes in  Dante 's press, the brush with the green velvet back
 for  Parnell  and the brush with the maroon velvet back for
  Michael Davitt . But he had not told  Fleming  to colour them
 those colours.  Fleming  had done it himself.</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> He opened the geography to study the lesson; but he could
 not learn the names of places in  America . Still they were all
 different places that had those different names. They were all in
 different countries and the countries were in continents and the
 continents were in the world and the world was in the universe.</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> He turned to the flyleaf of the geography and read what he
 had written there: himself, his name and where he was.</p>
<p class="lg">
  <span class="emph">  Stephen Dedalus  </span> <br>
  <span class="emph"> Class of Elements </span> <br>
  <span class="emph">   <span class="hide"> 53.310769 -6.684716 </span>   Clongowes Wood College   </span> <br>
  <span class="emph">   <span class="hide"> 53.251067 -6.665231 </span>   Sallins   </span> <br>
  <span class="emph">  County Kildare  </span> <br>
  <span class="emph">  Ireland  </span> <br>
  <span class="emph">  Europe  </span> <br>
  <span class="emph">  The World  </span> <br>
  <span class="emph">  The Universe  </span> <br>
</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> That was in his writing: and  Fleming  one night for a cod had
 written on the opposite page:</p>
<p class="lg">
  <span class="emph">  Stephen Dedalus  is my name, </span> <br>
  <span class="emph">  Ireland  is my nation. </span> <br>
  <span class="emph">   <span class="hide"> 53.310769 -6.684716 </span>   Clongowes   is my  dwellingplace  </span> <br>
  <span class="emph"> And heaven my expectation. </span> <br>
</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> He read the verses backwards but then they were not poetry.
 Then he read the flyleaf from the bottom to the top till he came
 to his own name. That was he: and he read down the page
 again. What was after  the universe ? Nothing. But was there
 anything round  the universe  to show where it stopped before
 the nothing place began? It could not be a wall but there could
 be a thin thin line there all round everything. It was very big to
 think about everything and everywhere. Only  God  could do
 that. He tried to think what a big thought that must be but he
 could think only of  God .  God  was  God 's name just as his name
 was  Stephen .  <span class="emph"> Dieu </span>  was the French for  God  and that was  God 's
 name too; and when anyone prayed to  God  and said  <span class="emph"> Dieu </span>  then
  God  knew at once that it was a French person that was pray-
  ing. But though there were different names for  God  in all the
 different languages in the world and  God  understood what all
 the people who prayed said in their different languages still
  God  remained always the same  God  and  God 's real name was
  God .</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> It made him very tired to think that way. It made him feel
 his head very big. He turned over the flyleaf and looked wearily
 at the green round earth in the middle of the maroon clouds.
 He wondered which was right, to be for the green or for the
 maroon, because  Dante  had ripped the green velvet back off
 the brush that was for  Parnell  one day with her scissors and
 had told him that  Parnell  was a bad man. He wondered if they
 were arguing at home about that. That was called politics.
 There were two sides in it:  Dante  was on one side and his
 father and  Mr Casey  were on the other side but his mother and
  uncle Charles  were on no side. Every day there was something
 in the paper about it.</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> It pained him that he did not know well what politics meant
 and that he did not know where the universe ended. He felt
 small and weak. When would he be like the fellows in poetry
 and rhetoric? They had big voices and big boots and they
 studied trigonometry. That was very far away. First came the
 vacation and then the next term and then vacation again and
 then again another term and then again the vacation. It was
 like a train going in and out of tunnels and that was like the
 noise of the boys eating in the refectory when you opened and
 closed the flaps of the ears. Term, vacation; tunnel, out; noise,
 stop. How far away it was! It was better to go to bed to sleep.
 Only prayers in the chapel and then bed. He shivered and
 yawned. It would be lovely in bed after the sheets got a bit hot.
 First they were so cold to get into. He shivered to think how
 cold they were first. But then they got hot and then he could
 sleep. It was lovely to be tired. He yawned again. Night prayers
 and then bed: he shivered and wanted to yawn. It would be
 lovely in a few minutes. He felt a warm glow creeping up from
 the cold shivering sheets, warmer and warmer till he felt warm
 all over, ever so warm; ever so warm and yet he shivered a little
 and still wanted to yawn.</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> The bell rang for night prayers and he filed out of the  study-
 hall  after the others and down the staircase and along the
 corridors to the chapel. The corridors were darkly lit and the
 chapel was darkly lit. Soon all would be dark and sleeping.
 There was cold night air in the chapel and the marbles were the
 colour the sea was at night. The sea was cold day and night:
 but it was colder at night. It was cold and dark under the
 seawall beside his father's house. But the kettle would be on the
 hob to make punch.</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> The prefect of the chapel prayed above his head and his
 memory knew the responses:</p>
<p class="lg"><span class="tag type">prayer</span>
  <span class="emph"> O Lord, open our lips </span> <br>
  <span class="emph"> And our mouth shall announce Thy praise. </span> <br>
  <span class="emph"> Incline unto our aid, O God! </span> <br>
  <span class="emph"> O Lord, make haste to help us! </span> <br>
</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> There was a cold night smell in the chapel. But it was a holy
 smell. It was not like the smell of the old peasants who knelt at
 the back of the chapel at Sunday mass. That was a smell of air
 and rain and turf and corduroy. But they were very holy peas-
 ants. They breathed behind him on his neck and sighed as they
 prayed. They lived in   <span class="hide"> 53.293785 -6.687040 </span>   Clane , , a fellow said: there were little
 cottages there and he had seen a woman standing at the  half-
 door  of a cottage with a child in her arms, as the cars had come
 past from   <span class="hide"> 53.251067 -6.665231 </span>   Sallins  . It would be lovely to sleep for one night in
 that cottage before the fire of smoking turf, in the dark lit by
 the fire, in the warm dark, breathing the smell of the peasants,
 air and rain and turf and corduroy. But, O, the road there
 between the trees was dark! You would be lost in the dark. It
 made him afraid to think of how it was.</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> He heard the voice of the prefect of the chapel saying the last
 prayer. He prayed it too against the dark outside under the
 trees.</p>
<p class="textParagraph">  Visit, we beseech Thee, O Lord, this habitation and
 drive away from it all the snares of the enemy. May
 Thy holy angels dwell herein to preserve us in peace
 and may Thy blessing be always upon us through
 Christ, Our Lord. Amen. </p>
<p class="textParagraph"> His fingers trembled as he undressed himself in the dormi-
 tory. He told his fingers to hurry up. He had to undress and
 then kneel and say his own prayers and be in bed before the gas
 was lowered so that he might not go to hell when he died. He
 rolled his stockings off and put on his nightshirt quickly and
 knelt trembling at his bedside and repeated his prayers quickly
 quickly fearing that the gas would go down. He felt his shoul-
ders shaking as he murmured:</p>
<p class="lg"><span class="tag type">prayer</span>
  God bless my father and my mother and spare them to
 me! <br>
  God bless my little brothers and sisters and spare them
 to me! <br>
  God bless  Dante  and  uncle Charles  and spare them to
 me! <br>
</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> He blessed himself and climbed quickly into bed and, tuck-
 ing the end of the nightshirt under his feet, curled himself to
 gether under the cold white sheets, shaking and trembling. But
 he would not go to hell when he died; and the shaking would
 stop. A voice bade the boys in the dormitory goodnight. He
 peered out for an instant over the coverlet and saw the yellow
 curtains round and before his bed that shut him off on all sides.
 The light was lowered quietly.</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> The prefect's shoes went away. Where? Down the staircase
 and along the corridors or to his room at the end? He saw the
 dark. Was it true about the black dog that walked there at night
 with eyes as big as  carriagelamps ? They said it was the ghost of
 a murderer. A long shiver of fear flowed over his body. He saw
 the dark entrance hall of the castle. Old servants in old dress
 were in the  ironingroom  above the staircase. It was long ago.
 The old servants were quiet. There was a fire there but the hall
 was still dark. A figure came up the staircase from the hall. He
 wore the white cloak of a marshal; his face was pale and
 strange; he held his hand pressed to his side. He looked out of
 strange eyes at the old servants. They looked at him and saw
 their master's face and cloak and knew that he had received his
  deathwound . But only the dark was where they looked: only
 dark silent air. Their master had received his  deathwound  on
 the battlefield of   <span class="hide"> 50.075538 14.437800 </span>   Prague   far away over the sea. He was standing
 on the field; his hand was pressed to his side; his face was pale
 and strange and he wore the white cloak of a marshal.</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> O how cold and strange it was to think of that! All the dark
 was cold and strange. There were pale strange faces there, great
 eyes like  carriagelamps . They were the ghosts of murderers, the
 figures of marshals who had received their  deathwound  on
 battlefields far away over the sea. What did they wish to say
 that their faces were so strange?</p>
<p class="textParagraph">  Visit, we beseech Thee, O Lord, this habitation and drive
 away from it all.... </p>
<p class="textParagraph"> Going home for the holidays! That would be lovely: the
 fellows had told him. Getting up on the cars in the early wintry
 morning outside the door of the castle. The cars were rolling
 on the gravel. Cheers for the rector!</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> Hurray! Hurray! Hurray!</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> The cars drove past the chapel and all caps were raised.
 They drove merrily along the country roads. The drivers
 pointed with their whips to   <span class="hide"> 53.262617 -6.666295 </span>   Bodenstown  . The fellows cheered.
 They passed the farmhouse of the Jolly Farmer. Cheer after
The fellows cheered. They passed the farmhouse of the Jolly Farmer. Cheer after
 cheer after cheer. Through   <span class="hide"> 53.293785 -6.687040 </span>   Clane   they drove, cheering and
 cheered. The peasant women stood at the  halfdoors , the men
 stood here and there. The lovely smell there was in the wintry
 air: the smell of Clane: rain and wintry air and turf smoul-
 dering and corduroy.</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> The train was full of fellows: a long long chocolate train
 with cream facings. The guards went to and fro opening,
 closing, locking, unlocking the doors. They were men in dark
 blue and silver; they had silvery whistles and their keys made a
 quick music: click, click: click, click.</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> And the train raced on over the flat lands and past the   <span class="hide"> 53.230556 -6.866389 </span>   Hill
 of Allen  . The  telegraphpoles  were passing, passing. The train
 went on and on. It knew. There were coloured lanterns in the
 hall of his father's house and ropes of green branches. There
 were holly and ivy round the  pierglass  and holly and ivy, green
 and red, twined round the chandeliers. There were red holly
 and green ivy round the old portraits on the walls. Holly and
 ivy for him and for Christmas.</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> Lovely......</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> All the people. Welcome home,  Stephen ! Noises of welcome.
 His mother kissed him. Was that right? His father was a mar-
 shal now: higher than a magistrate. Welcome home,  Stephen !</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> Noises...</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> There was a noise of  curtainrings  running back along the
 rods, of water being splashed in the basins. There was a noise
 of rising and dressing and washing in the dormitory: a noise of
 clapping of hands as the prefect went up and down telling the
 fellows to look sharp. A pale sunlight showed the yellow cur-
 tains drawn back, the tossed beds. His bed was very hot and his
 face and body were very hot.</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> He got up and sat on the side of his bed. He was weak. He
 tried to pull on his stocking. It had a horrid rough feel. The
 sunlight was queer and cold.</p>
<p class="textParagraph">  Fleming  said:</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Fleming</span>―Are you not well? </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph"> He did not know; and  Fleming  said:</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Fleming</span>―Get back into bed. I'll tell  McGlade  you're not well. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph"> <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Fleming</span>―He's sick. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph"> <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog"></span>―Who is? </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph"> <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Fleming</span>―Tell  McGlade . </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph"> <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog"></span>―Get back into bed. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph"> <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog"></span>―Is he sick? </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph"> A fellow held his arms while he loosened the stocking cling-
 ing to his foot and climbed back into the hot bed.</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> He crouched down between the sheets, glad of their tepid
 glow. He heard the fellows talk among themselves about him
 as they dressed for mass. It was a mean thing to do, to shoulder
 him into the square ditch, they were saying.</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> Then their voices ceased; they had gone. A voice at his bed
 said:</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Wells</span>―  Dedalus , don't spy on us, sure you won't? </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  Wells 's face was there. He looked at it and saw that  Wells 
 was afraid.</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Wells</span>―I didn't mean to. Sure you won't? </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph"> His father had told him, whatever he did, never to peach on
 a fellow. He shook his head and answered no and felt glad.
  Wells  said:</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Wells</span>―I didn't mean to, honour bright. It was only for cod. I'm
 sorry. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph"> The face and the voice went away. Sorry because he was
 afraid. Afraid that it was some disease. Canker was a disease of
 plants and cancer one of animals: or another different. That
 was a long time ago then out on the playgrounds in the evening
 light, creeping from point to point on the fringe of his line, a
 heavy bird flying low through the grey light.  Leicester Abbey  lit
 up.  Wolsey  died there. The abbots buried him themselves.</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> It was not  Wells 's face, it was the prefect's. He was not
 foxing. No, no: he was sick really. He was not foxing. And he
 felt the prefect's hand on his forehead; and he felt his forehead
 warm and damp against the prefect's cold damp hand. That
 was the way a rat felt, slimy and damp and cold. Every rat had
 two eyes to look out of. Sleek slimy coats, little little feet
 tucked up to jump, black shiny eyes to look out of. They could
 understand how to jump. But the minds of rats could not
 understand trigonometry. When they were dead they lay on
 their sides. Their coats dried then. They were only dead things.</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> The prefect was there again and it was his voice that was
 saying that he was to get up, that  Father Minister  had said he
 was to get up and dress and go to the infirmary. And while he
 was dressing himself as quickly as he could the prefect said:</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">the prefect</span>―We must pack off to  Brother Michael  because we have the
 collywobbles. Terrible thing to have the collywobbles! How we
 wobble when we have the collywobbles! </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph"> He was very decent to say that. That was all to make him
 laugh. But he could not laugh because his cheeks and lips were
 all shivery: and then the prefect had to laugh by himself.</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> The prefect cried:</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">the prefect</span>―Quick march! Hayfoot! Strawfoot! </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph"> They went together down the staircase and along the corri-
 dor and past the bath. As he passed the door he remembered
 with a vague fear the warm  turfcoloured  bogwater, the warm
 moist air, the noise of plunges, the smell of the towels, like
 medicine.</p>
<p class="textParagraph">  Brother Michael  was standing at the door of the infirmary
 and from the door of the dark cabinet on his right came a smell
 like medicine. That came from the bottles on the shelves. The
 prefect spoke to  Brother Michael  and  Brother Michael 
 answered and called the prefect sir. He had reddish hair mixed
 with grey and a queer look. It was queer that he would always
 be a brother. It was queer too that you could not call him sir
 because he was a brother and had a different kind of look. Was
 he not holy enough or why could he not catch up on the others?</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> There were two beds in the room and in one bed there was a
 fellow: and when they went in he called out:</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Athy</span>―Hello! It's young  Dedalus ! What's up? </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph"> <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Brother Michael</span>―The sky is up,  Brother Michael  said. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph"> He was a fellow out of the third of grammar and, while  Stephen 
 was undressing, he asked  Brother Michael  to bring him a round
 of buttered toast.</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Athy</span>―Ah, do! he said. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph"> <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Brother Michael</span>―Butter you up! said  Brother Michael . You'll get your walking
 papers in the morning when the doctor comes. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph"> <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Athy</span>―Will I? the fellow said. I'm not well yet. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  Brother Michael  repeated:</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Athy</span>―You'll get your walking papers, I tell you. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph"> He bent down to rake the fire. He had a long back like the
 long back of a  tramhorse . He shook the poker gravely and
 nodded his head at the fellow out of third of grammar.</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> Then  Brother Michael  went away and after a while the fel-
 low out of third of grammar turned in towards the wall and fell
 asleep.</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> That was the infirmary. He was sick then. Had they written
 home to tell his mother and father? But it would be quicker for
 one of the priests to go himself to tell them. Or he would write
 a letter for the priest to bring.</p>
<p class="lg"><span class="tag type">letter</span>
  <span class="emph"> Dear Mother </span> <br>
  <span class="emph"> I am sick. I want to go home. Please come and take
 me home. I am in the infirmary. </span> <br>
  <span class="emph"> Your fond son, </span> <br>
  <span class="emph">  Stephen  </span> <br>
</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> How far away they were! There was cold sunlight outside
 the window. He wondered if he would die. You could die just
 the same on a sunny day. He might die before his mother came.
 Then he would have a dead mass in the chapel like the way the
 fellows had told him it was when  Little  had died. All the fellows would be at the mass, dressed in black, all with sad faces.
  Wells  too would be there but no fellow would look at him. The
 rector would be there in a cope of black and gold and there
 would be tall yellow candles on the altar and round the cata-
 falque. And they would carry the coffin out of the chapel
 slowly and he would be buried in the little graveyard of the
 community off the main avenue of limes. And  Wells  would be
 sorry then for what he had done. And the bell would toll
 slowly.</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> He could hear the tolling. He said over to himself the song
 that  Brigid  had taught him.</p>
<p class="lg"><span class="tag type">song</span>
  <span class="emph"> Dingdong! The castle bell! </span> <br>
  <span class="emph"> Farewell, my mother! </span> <br>
  <span class="emph"> Bury me in the old churchyard </span> <br>
  <span class="emph"> Beside my eldest brother. </span> <br>
  <span class="emph"> My coffin shall be black, </span> <br>
  <span class="emph"> Six angels at my back, </span> <br>
  <span class="emph"> Two to sing and two to pray </span> <br>
  <span class="emph"> And two to carry my soul away. </span> <br>
</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> How beautiful and sad that was! How beautiful the words
 were where they said <span class="emph"> Bury me in the old churchyard </span>! A tremor
 passed over his body. How sad and how beautiful! He wanted
 to cry quietly but not for himself: for the words, so beautiful
 and sad, like music. The bell! The bell! Farewell! O farewell!</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> The cold sunlight was weaker and  Brother Michael  was
 standing at his bedside with a bowl of  beeftea . He was glad for
 his mouth was hot and dry. He could hear them playing on the
 playgrounds. It was after lunchtime. And the day was going on
 in the college just as if he were there.</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> Then  Brother Michael  was going away and the fellow out of
 third of grammar told him to be sure and come back and tell
 him all the news in the paper. He told  Stephen  that his name
 was  Athy  and that his father kept a lot of racehorses that were
 spiffing jumpers and that his father would give a good tip to
  Brother Mi-
 chael  any time he wanted it because  Brother Michael  was very decent and always told him the news out of the
 paper they got every day up in the castle. There was every kind
 of news in the paper: accidents, shipwrecks, sports and politics.</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Athy</span>―Now it is all about politics in the paper, he said. Do your
 people talk about that too? </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph"> <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen</span>―Yes,  Stephen  said. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph"> <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Athy</span>―Mine too, he said. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph"> Then he thought for a moment and said:</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Athy</span>―You have a queer name,  Dedalus , and I have a queer name
 too,   <span class="hide"> 52.991834 -6.985728 </span>    Athy   . My name is the name of a town. Your name is like
 Latin. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph"> Then he asked:</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Athy</span>―Are you good at riddles? </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  Stephen  answered:</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen</span>―Not very good. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph"> Then he said:</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Athy</span>―Can you answer me this one? Why is the county  Kildare  like
 the leg of a fellow's breeches? </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  Stephen  thought what could be the answer and then said:</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen</span>―I give it up. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph"> <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Athy</span>―Because there is a thigh in it, he said. Do you see the joke?
   Athy   is the town in the county  Kildare  and a thigh is the other
 thigh. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph"> <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen</span>―O, I see,  Stephen  said. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph"> <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Athy</span>―That's an old riddle, he said. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph"> After a moment he said:</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Athy</span>―I say! </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph"> <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen</span>―What? asked  Stephen . </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph"> <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Athy</span>―You know, he said, you can ask that riddle another way? </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph"> <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen</span>―Can you? said  Stephen . </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph"> <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Athy</span>―The same riddle, he said. Do you know the other way to ask
 it?</p></p>
<p class="textParagraph"> <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen</span>―No, said  Stephen . </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph"> <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Athy</span>―Can you not think of the other way? he said. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph"> He looked at  Stephen  over the bedclothes as he spoke. Then
 he lay back on the pillow and said:</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Athy</span>―There is another way but I won't tell you what it is. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph"> Why did he not tell it? His father, who kept the racehorses,
 must be a magistrate too like  Saurin 's father and  Nasty Roche 's
 father. He thought of his own father, of how he sang songs
 while his mother played and of how he always gave him a
 shilling when he asked for sixpence and he felt sorry for him
 that he was not a magistrate like the other boys' fathers. Then
 why was he sent to that place with them? But his father had
 told him that he would be no stranger there because his grand-
 uncle had presented an address to the liberator there fifty years
 before. You could know the people of that time by their old
 dress. It seemed to him a solemn time: and he wondered if that
 was the time when the fellows in  Clongowes  wore blue coats
 with brass buttons and yellow waistcoats and caps of  rabbit-
skin  and drank beer like grownup people and kept greyhounds
 of their own to course the hares with.</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> He looked at the window and saw that the daylight had
 grown weaker. There would be cloudy grey light over the play-
 grounds. There was no noise on the playgrounds. The class
 must be doing the themes or perhaps  Father Arnall  was reading
 a legend out of the book.</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> It was queer that they had not given him any medicine.
 Perhaps  Brother Michael  would bring it back when he came.
 They said you got stinking stuff to drink when you were in the
 infirmary. But he felt better now than before. It would be nice
 getting better slowly. You could get a book then. There was a
 book in the library about  Holland . There were lovely foreign
 names in it and pictures of  strangelooking  cities and ships. It
 made you feel so happy.</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> How pale the light was at the window! But that was nice.
 The fire rose and fell on the wall. It was like waves. Someone
 had put coal on and he heard voices. They were talking. It was
 the noise of the waves. Or the waves were talking among them-
selves as they rose and fell.</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> He saw the sea of waves, long dark waves rising and falling,
 dark under the moonless night. A tiny light twinkled at the
 pierhead where the ship was entering: and he saw a multitude
 of people gathered by the waters' edge to see the ship that was
 entering their harbour. A tall man stood on the deck, looking
 out towards the flat dark land: and by the light at the pierhead
 he saw his face, the sorrowful face of  Brother Michael .</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> He saw him lift his hand towards the people and heard him
 say in a loud voice of sorrow over the waters:</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Brother Michael</span>―He is dead. We saw him lying upon the catafalque. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph"> A wail of sorrow went up from the people.</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">the people</span>―Parnell!  Parnell ! He is dead! </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph"> They fell upon their knees, moaning in sorrow.</p>
<p class="textParagraph"> And he saw  Dante  in a maroon velvet dress and with a green
 velvet mantle hanging from her shoulders walking proudly and
 silently past the people who knelt by the waters' edge.</p>

		

	  

 
<p class="textParagraph">  A great fire, banked high and red, flamed in the grate and
 under the ivytwined branches of the chandelier the Christmas
 table was spread. They had come home a little late and still
 dinner was not ready: but it would be ready in a jiffy, his
 mother had said. They were waiting for the door to open and
 for the servants to come in, holding the big dishes covered with
 their heavy metal covers.</p>
<p class="textParagraph">  All were waiting: uncle Charles, who sat far away in the
 shadow of the window, Dante and Mr Casey, who sat in the
 easychairs at either side of the hearth, Stephen, seated on a
 chair between them, his feet resting on the toasted boss. Mr
 Dedalus looked at himself in the pierglass above the mantel-
 piece, waxed out his moustache ends and then, parting his
 coattails, stood with his back to the glowing fire: and still, from
 time to time, he withdrew a hand from his coattail to wax out
 one of his moustache ends. Mr Casey leaned his head to one
 side and, smiling, tapped the gland of his neck with his fingers.
 And Stephen smiled too for he knew now that it was not true
 that Mr Casey had a purse of silver in his throat. He smiled to
 think how the silvery noise which Mr Casey used to make had
 deceived him. And when he had tried to open Mr Casey's hand
 to see if the purse of silver was hidden there he had seen that
 the fingers could not be straightened out: and Mr Casey had
 told him that he had got those three cramped fingers making a
 birthday present for Queen Victoria.</p>
<p class="textParagraph">  Mr Casey tapped the gland of his neck and smiled at StephenSte-
 phen with sleepy eyes: and Mr Dedalus said to him:
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―Yes. Well now, that's all right. O, we had a good walk,
 hadn't we, John? Yes ...... I wonder if there's any likelihood of
 dinner this evening. Yes ..... O, well now, we got a good breath
 of ozone round <span class="hide">53.190760 -6.089490</span>the Head today. Ay, bedad. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  He turned to Dante and said:
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">John Casey</span>―You didn't stir out at all, Mrs Riordan? </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  Dante frowned and said shortly:
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Dante</span>―No. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  Mr Dedalus dropped his coattails and went over to the side-
 sideboard. He brought forth a great stone jar of whisky from the
 locker and filled the decanter slowly, bending now and then to
 see how much he had poured in. Then replacing the jar in the
 locker he poured out a little of the whisky into two glasses,
 added a little water and came with them back to the fireplace.
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―A thimbleful, John, he said. Just to whet your appetite. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  Mr Casey took the glass, drank, and placed it near him on
 the mantelpiece. Then he said:
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">John Casey</span>―Well, I can't help thinking of our friend Christopher manu-
 facturing .... </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  He broke into a fit of laughter and coughing and added:
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">John Casey</span>―... manufacturing that champagne for those fellows. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  Mr Dedalus laughed loudly.
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―Is it Christy? he said. There's more cunning in one of those
 warts on his bald head than in a pack of jack foxes. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  He inclined his head, closed his eyes, and, licking his lips
 profusely, began to speak with the voice of the hotel keeper.
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―And he has such a soft mouth when he's speaking to you,
 don't you know. He's very moist and watery about the dew-
 dewlaps, God bless him. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  Mr Casey was still struggling through his fit of coughing and
 laughter. Stephen, seeing and hearing the hotel keeper through
 his father's face and voice, laughed.</p>
<p class="textParagraph">  Mr Dedalus put up his eyeglass and, staring down at him,
 said quietly and kindly:
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―What are you laughing at, you little puppy, you? </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  The servants entered and placed the dishes on the table. Mrs
 Dedalus followed and the places were arranged.
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mary Dedalus</span>―Sit over, she said. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  Mr Dedalus went to the end of the table and said:
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―Now, Mrs Riordan, sit over. John, sit you down, my hearty. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  He looked round to where uncle Charles sat and said:
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―Now then, sir, there's a bird here waiting for you. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  When all had taken their seats he laid his hand on the cover
 and then said quickly, withdrawing it:
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―Now, Stephen. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  Stephen stood up in his place to say the grace before meals:</p>
<p class="textParagraph">   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen</span> <p class="lg"> Bless us, O Lord, and these Thy gifts which through<br>
 Thy bounty we are about to receive through Christ<br>
 Our Lord. Amen. <br> </p> </p>  </p>
<p class="textParagraph">  All blessed themselves and Mr Dedalus with a sigh of pleas-
 ure lifted from the dish the heavy cover pearled around the
 edge with glistening drops.</p>
<p class="textParagraph">  Stephen looked at the plump turkey which had lain, trussed
 and skewered, on the kitchen table. He knew that his father
 had paid a guinea for it in <span class="hide">53.346308 -6.257925</span>Dunn's of D'Olier Street and that the
 man had prodded it often at the breastbone to show how good
 it was: and he remembered the man's voice when he had said:
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">the butcher</span>―Take that one, sir. That's the real Ally Daly. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  Why did Mr Barrett in Clongowes call his pandybat a tur-
 key? It was not like a turkey. But Clongowes was far away: and
 the warm heavy smell of turkey and ham and celery rose from
 the plates and dishes and the great fire was banked high and
 red in the grate and the green ivy and red holly made you feel
 so happy and when dinner was ended the big plumpudding
 would be carried in, studded with peeled almonds and sprigs of
 holly, with bluish fire running around it and a little green flag
 flying from the top.</p>
<p class="textParagraph">  It was his first Christmas dinner and he thought of his little
 brothers and sisters who were waiting in the nursery, as he had
 often waited, till the pudding came. The deep low collar and
 the <span class="hide">51.487402 -0.607942</span>Eton jacket made him feel queer and oldish: and that morn-
 ing when his mother had brought him down to the parlour,
 dressed for mass, his father had cried. That was because he was
 thinking of his own father. And uncle Charles had said so too.</p>
<p class="textParagraph">  Mr Dedalus covered the dish and began to eat hungrily.
 Then he said:
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―Poor old Christy, he's nearly lopsided now with roguery. </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mary Dedalus</span>―Simon, said Mrs Dedalus, you haven't given Mrs Riordan
 any sauce. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  Mr Dedalus seized the sauceboat.
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―Haven't I?  he cried. Mrs Riordan, pity the poor blind. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  Dante covered her plate with her hands and said:
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Dante</span>―No, thanks. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  Mr Dedalus turned to uncle Charles.
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―How are you off, sir? </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Uncle Charles</span>―Right as the mail, Simon. </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―You, John? </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">John Casey</span>―I'm all right. Go on yourself. </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―Mary? Here, Stephen, here's something to make your hair
 curl. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  He poured sauce freely over Stephen's plate and set the boat
 again on the table. Then he asked uncle Charles was it tender.
 Uncle Charles could not speak because his mouth was full but
 he nodded that it was.
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―That was a good answer our friend made to the canon.
 What? said Mr Dedalus. </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">John Casey</span>―I didn't think he had that much in him, said Mr Casey. </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―I'll pay you your dues, father, when you cease turning the
 house of God into a pollingbooth.</p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Dante</span>―A nice answer, said Dante, for any man calling himself a
 catholic to give to his priest. </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―They have only themselves to blame, said Mr Dedalus
 suavely. If they took a fool's advice they would confine their
 attention to religion. </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Dante</span>―It is religion, Dante said. They are doing their duty in warn-
 ing the people. </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">John Casey</span>―We go to the house of God, Mr Casey said, in all humility to
 pray to our Maker and not to hear election addresses. </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Dante</span>―It is religion, Dante said again. They are right. They must
 direct their flocks. </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―And preach politics from the altar, is it? asked Mr Dedalus. </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Dante</span>―Certainly, said Dante. It is a question of public morality. A
 priest would not be a priest if he did not tell his flock what is
 right and what is wrong. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  Mrs Dedalus laid down her knife and fork, saying:
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mary Dedalus</span>―For pity's sake and for pity' sake let us have no political
 discussion on this day of all days in the year. </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Uncle Charles</span>―Quite right, ma'am, said uncle Charles. Now, Simon, that's
 quite enough now. Not another word now. </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―Yes, yes, said Mr Dedalus quickly. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  He uncovered the dish boldly and said:
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―Now then, who's for more turkey? </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  Nobody answered. Dante said:
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Dante</span>―Nice language for any catholic to use! </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mary Dedalus</span>―Mrs Riordan, I appeal to you, said Mrs Dedalus, to let the
 matter drop now. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  Dante turned on her and said:
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Dante</span>―And am I to sit here and listen to the pastors of my church
 being flouted? </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―Nobody is saying a word against them, said Mr Dedalus, so
 long as they don't meddle in politics. </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Dante</span>―The bishops and priests of Ireland have spoken, said Dante,
 and they must be obeyed. </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">John Casey</span>―Let them leave politics alone, said Mr Casey, or the people
 may leave their church alone. </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Dante</span>―You hear? said Dante turning to Mrs Dedalus. </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mary Dedalus</span>―Mr Casey! Simon! said Mrs Dedalus. Let it end now. </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Uncle Charles</span>―Too bad! Too bad! said uncle Charles. </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―What? cried Mr Dedalus. Were we to desert him at the bid-
 ding of the English people? </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Dante</span>―He was no longer worthy to lead, said Dante. He was a
 public sinner. </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">John Casey</span>―We are all sinners and black sinners, said Mr Casey coldly. </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Dante</span>―Matthew 18.7Woe be to the man by whom the scandal cometh! said Mrs
 Riordan. Luke 17.1-2It would be better for him that a millstone were tied
 about his neck and that he were cast into the depths of the sea
 rather than that he should scandalise one of these, my least
 little ones. That is the language of the Holy Ghost.</p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―And very bad language, if you ask me, said Mr Dedalus
 coolly. </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Uncle Charles</span>―Simon! Simon! said uncle Charles. The boy. </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―Yes, yes, said Mr Dedalus. I meant about the ... I was think-
 ing about the bad language of that railway porter. Well now,
 that's all right. Here, Stephen, show me your plate, old chap.
 Eat away now. Here. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  He heaped up the food on Stephen's plate and served uncle
 Charles and Mr Casey to large pieces of turkey and splashes of
 sauce. Mrs Dedalus was eating little and Dante sat with her
 hands in her lap. She was red in the face. Mr Dedalus rooted
 with the carvers at the end of the dish and said:
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―There's a tasty bit here we call the pope's nose. If any lady
 or gentleman .....</p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  He held a piece of fowl up on the prong of the carvingfork.
 Nobody spoke. He put it on his own plate, saying:
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―Well, you can't say but you were asked. I think I had better
 eat it myself because I'm not well in my health lately. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  He winked at Stephen and, replacing the dishcover, began to
 eat again.</p>
<p class="textParagraph">  There was a silence while he ate. Then he said:
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―Well now, the day kept up fine after all. There were plenty
 of strangers down too. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  Nobody spoke. He said again:
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―I think there were more strangers down than last Christmas. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  He looked round at the others whose faces were bent to-
 towards their plates and, receiving no reply, waited for a moment
 and said bitterly:
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―Well, my Christmas dinner has been spoiled anyhow. </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Dante</span>―There could be neither luck nor grace, Dante said, in a house
 where there is no respect for the pastors of the church. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  Mr Dedalus threw his knife and fork noisily on his plate.
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―Respect! he said. Is it for Billy with the lip or for the tub of
 guts up in <span class="hide">54.350280 -6.652792</span>Armagh? Respect! </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">John Casey</span>―Princes of the church, said Mr Casey with slow scorn. </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―Lord Leitrim's coachman, yes, said Mr Dedalus. </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Dante</span>―They are the Lord's anointed, Dante said. They are an hon-
 our to their country. </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―Tub of guts, said Mr Dedalus coarsely. He has a handsome
 face, mind you, in repose. You should see that fellow lapping
 up his bacon and cabbage of a cold winter's day. O Johnny! </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  He twisted his features into a grimace of heavy bestiality and
 made a lapping noise with his lips.
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mary Dedalus</span>―Really, Simon, said Mrs Dedalus, you should not speak that
 way before Stephen. It's not right. </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Dante</span>―O, he'll remember all this when he grows up, said Dante
 hotly, - the language he heard against God and religion and
 priests in his own home. </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">John Casey</span>―Let him remember too, cried Mr Casey to her from across
 the table, the language with which the priests and the priests'
 pawns broke Parnell's heart and hounded him into his grave.
 Let him remember that too when he grows up. </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―Sons of bitches! cried Mr Dedalus. When he was down they
 turned on him to betray him and rend him like rats in a sewer.
 Lowlived dogs! And they look it! By Christ, they look it! </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Dante</span>―They behaved rightly, cried Dante. They obeyed their
 bishops and their priests. Honour to them! </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mary Dedalus</span>―Well, it is perfectly dreadful to say that not even for one day
 of the year, said Mrs Dedalus, can we be free from these dread-
 ful disputes! </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  Uncle Charles raised his hands mildly and said:
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Uncle Charles</span>―Come now, come now, come now! Can we not have our
 opinions whatever they are without this bad temper and this
 bad language? It is too bad surely. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  Mrs Dedalus spoke to Dante in a low voice but Dante said
 loudly:
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Dante</span>―I will not say nothing. I will defend my church and my
 religion when it is insulted and spit on by renegade catholics. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  Mr Casey pushed his plate rudely into the middle of the
 table and, resting his elbows before him, said in a harsh voice
 to his host:
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">John Casey</span>―Tell me, did I tell you that story about a very famous spit? </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―You did not, John, said Mr Dedalus. </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">John Casey</span>―Why then, said Mr Casey, it is a most instructive story. It
 happened not long ago in the <span class="hide"> 52.986231 -6.367254</span>county Wicklow where we are
 now. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  He broke off and, turning towards Dante, said with quiet
 indignation:
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">John Casey</span>―And I may tell you, ma'am, that I, if you mean me, am no
 renegade catholic. I am a catholic as my father was and his
 father before him and his father before him again when we
 gave up our lives rather than sell our faith. </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Dante</span>―The more shame to you now, Dante said, to speak as you
 do. </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―The story, John, said Mr Dedalus smiling. Let us have the
 story anyhow. </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Dante</span>―Catholic indeed! repeated Dante ironically. The blackest
 protestant in the land would not speak the language I have
 heard this evening. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  Mr Dedalus began to sway his head to and fro, crooning like
 a country singer.
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">John Casey</span>―I am no protestant, I tell you again, said Mr Casey flushing. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  Mr Dedalus, still crooning and swaying his head, began to
 sing in a grunting nasal tone:
<p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span> 
<p class="lg">
 O, come all you Roman catholics<br>
 That never went to mass.<br>
</p>
 </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  He took up his knife and fork again in good humour and set
 to eating, saying to Mr Casey:
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―Let us have the story, John. It will help us to digest. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  Stephen looked with affection at Mr Casey's face which
 stared across the table over his joined hands. He liked to sit
 near him at the fire, looking up at his dark fierce face. But his
 dark eyes were never fierce and his slow voice was good to
 listen to. But why was he then against the priests? Because
 Dante must be right then. But he had heard his father say that
 she was a spoiled nun and that she had come out of the convent
 in the Alleghanies when her brothers had got the money from
 the savages for the trinkets and  chainies. Perhaps that made her
 severe against Parnell. And she did not like him to play with
 Eileen because Eileen was a protestant and when she was
 young she knew children that used to play with protestants and
 the protestants used to make fun of the litany of the Blessed
 Virgin. <span class="emph">Tower of Ivory</span>, they used to say, <span class="emph">House of Gold!</span> How
 could a woman be a tower of ivory or a house of gold? Who
 was right then? And he remembered the evening in the infirm-
 ary in Clongowes, the dark waters, the light at the pierhead
 and the moan of sorrow from the people when they had heard.</p>
<p class="textParagraph">  Eileen had long white hands. One evening when playing tig
 she had put her hands over his eyes: long and white and thin
 and cold and soft. That was ivory: a cold white thing. That
 was the meaning of <span class="emph">Tower of Ivory</span>.
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">John Casey</span>―The story is very short and sweet, Mr Casey said. It was one
 day down in <span class="hide">52.797693 -6.159929</span>Arklow, a cold bitter day, not long before the
 chief died. May God have mercy on him! </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  He closed his eyes wearily and paused. Mr Dedalus took a
 bone from his plate and tore some meat from it with his teeth,
 saying:
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―Before he was killed, you mean. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  Mr Casey opened his eyes, sighed and went on:
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">John Casey</span>―It was down in Arklow one day. We were down there at a
 meeting and after the meeting was over we had to make our
 way to the railway station through the crowd. Such booing and
 baaing, man, you never heard. They called us all the names in
 the world. Well there was one old lady, and a drunken old
 harridan she was surely, that paid all her attention to me. She
 kept dancing along beside me in the mud bawling and scream-
 ing into my face: <span class="emph">Priesthunter! The <span class="hide">48.856614 2.352222</span>Paris Funds! Mr Fox! Kitty
 O'Shea!</span> </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―And what did you do, John? asked Mr Dedalus. </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">John Casey</span>―I let her bawl away, said Mr Casey. It was a cold day and to
 keep up my heart I had (saving your presence, ma'am) a quid of
 <span class="hide">53.275526 -7.493385</span>Tullamore in my mouth and sure I couldn't say a word in any
 case because my mouth was full of tobacco juice. </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―Well, John? </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">John Casey</span>―Well. I let her bawl away to her heart's content <span class="emph">Kitty O'Shea</span>
 and the rest of it till at last she called that lady a name that I
 won't sully this Christmas board nor your ears, ma'am, nor my
 own lips by repeating. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  He paused. Mr Dedalus, lifting his head from the bone,
 asked:
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―And what did you do, John? </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">John Casey</span>―Do! said Mr Casey. She stuck her ugly old face up at me
 when she said it and I had my mouth full of tobacco juice. I
 bent down to her and <span class="emph">Phth!</span> says I to her like that. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  He turned aside and made the act of spitting.
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">John Casey</span>―<span class="emph">Phth!</span> says I to her like that, right into her eye. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  He clapped a hand to his eye and gave a hoarse scream of
 pain.
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">John Casey</span>―<span class="emph">O Jesus, Mary and Joseph!</span> says she. <span class="emph">I'm blinded! I'm
 blinded and drownded!</span> </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  He stopped in a fit of coughing and laughter, repeating:
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">John Casey</span>―<span class="emph">I'm blinded entirely!</span></p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  Mr Dedalus laughed loudly and lay back in his chair while
 uncle Charles swayed his head to and fro.</p>
<p class="textParagraph">  Dante looked terribly angry and repeated while they
 laughed:
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Dante</span>―Very nice! Ha! Very nice! </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  It was not nice about the spit in the woman's eye. But what
 was the name the woman had called Kitty O'Shea that Mr
 Casey would not repeat? He thought of Mr Casey walking
 through the crowds of people and making speeches from a
 wagonette. That was what he had been in prison for and he
 remembered that one night Sergeant O'Neill had come to the
 house and had stood in the hall, talking in a low voice with his
 father and chewing nervously at the chinstrap of his cap. And
 that night Mr Casey had not gone to <span class="hide">53.349805 -6.260310 </span>Dublin by train but a car
 had come to the door and he had heard his father say some-
 something about <span class="hide">53.265647 -6.156109</span>the Cabinteely road.</p>
<p class="textParagraph">  He was for Ireland and Parnell and so was his father: and so
 was Dante too for one night at the band on the esplanade she
 had hit a gentleman on the head with her umbrella because he
 had taken off his hat when the band played <span class="emph">God save the
 Queen</span> at the end.</p>
<p class="textParagraph">  Mr Dedalus gave a snort of contempt.
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―Ah, John, he said. It is true for them. We are an unfortunate
 priestridden race and always were and always will be till the
 end of the chapter. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  Uncle Charles shook his head, saying:
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Uncle Charles</span>―A bad business! A bad business! </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  Mr Dedalus repeated:
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―A priestridden Godforsaken race! </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  He pointed to the portrait of his grandfather on the wall to
 his right.
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―Do you see that old chap up there, John? he said. He was a
 good Irishman when there was no money in the job. He was
 condemned to death as a whiteboy. But he had a saying about
 our clerical friends, that he would never let one of them put his
 two feet under his mahogany. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  Dante broke in angrily:
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Dante</span>―If we are a priestridden race we ought to be proud of it!
 They are the apple of God's eye. Zacharia 2:8 <span class="emph">Touch them not, says Christ,
 for they are the apple of My eye.</span></p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">John Casey</span>―And can we not love our country then? asked Mr Casey. Are
 we not to follow the man that was born to lead us? </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Dante</span>―A traitor to his country! replied Dante. A traitor, an adul-
 adulterer! The priests were right to abandon him. The priests were
 always the true friends of Ireland. </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">John Casey</span>―Were they, faith? said Mr Casey. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  He threw his fist on the table and, frowning angrily, pro-
 protruded one finger after another.
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">John Casey</span>―Didn't the bishops of Ireland betray us in the time of the
 union when bishop Lanigan presented an address of loyalty to
 the marquess Cornwallis? Didn't the bishops and priests sell
 the aspirations of this country in 1829 in return for catholic
 emancipation? Didn't they denounce the fenian movement
 from the pulpit and in the confession box? And didn't they
 dishonour the ashes of Terence Bellew MacManus? </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  His face was glowing with anger and Stephen felt the glow
 rise to his own cheek as the spoken words thrilled him. Mr
 Dedalus uttered a guffaw of coarse scorn.
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">John Casey</span>―O, by God, he cried, I forgot little old Paul Cullen! Another
 apple of God's eye! </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  Dante bent across the table and cried to Mr Casey:
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Dante</span>―Right! Right! They were always right! God and morality and
 religion come first. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  Mrs Dedalus, seeing her excitement, said to her:
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mary Dedalus</span>―Mrs Riordan, don't excite yourself answering them. </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Dante</span>―God and religion before everything! Dante cried. God and
 religion before the world! </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  Mr Casey raised his clenched fist and brought it down on
 the table with a crash.
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">John Casey</span>―Very well, then, he shouted hoarsely, if it comes to that, no
 God for Ireland! </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―John! John! cried Mr Dedalus, seizing his guest by the coat
 coatsleeve. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  Dante stared across the table, her cheeks shaking. Mr Casey
 struggled up from his chair and bent across the table towards
 her, scraping the air from before his eyes with one hand as
 though he were tearing aside a cobweb.
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">John Casey</span>―No God for Ireland! he cried. We have had too much God in
 Ireland. Away with God! </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Dante</span>―Blasphemer! Devil! screamed Dante, starting to her feet and
 almost spitting in his face. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  Uncle Charles and Mr Dedalus pulled Mr Casey back into
 his chair again, talking to him from both sides reasonably. He
 stared before him out of his dark flaming eyes, repeating:
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">John Casey</span>―Away with God, I say! </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  Dante shoved her chair violently aside and left the table,
 upsetting her napkinring which rolled slowly along the carpet
 and came to rest against the foot of an easychair. Mrs Dedalus
 rose quickly and followed her towards the door. At the door
 Dante turned round violently and shouted down the room, her
 cheeks flushed and quivering with rage:
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Dante</span>―Devil out of hell! We won! We crushed him to death! Fiend! </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  The door slammed behind her.</p>
<p class="textParagraph">  Mr Casey, freeing his arms from his holders, suddenly
 bowed his head on his hands with a sob of pain.
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">John Casey</span>―Poor Parnell! he cried loudly. My dead king! </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  He sobbed loudly and bitterly.</p>
<p class="textParagraph">  Stephen, raising his terrorstricken face, saw that his father's
 eyes were full of tears.</p>
   
<p class="textParagraph">  The fellows talked together in little groups.</p>
<p class="textParagraph">  One fellow said:
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">a fellow</span>―They were caught near the <span class="hide">53.290670 -6.535060</span>Hill of Lyons. </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">a fellow</span>―Who caught them? </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">a fellow</span>―Mr Gleeson and the minister. They were on a car. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  The same fellow added:
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">a fellow</span>―A fellow in the higher line told me. </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Fleming</span>Fleming asked: </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">a fellow</span>―But why did they run away, tell us? </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Cecil Thunder</span>―I know why, Cecil Thunder said. Because they had fecked
 cash out of the rector's room. </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">a fellow</span>―Who fecked it? </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">John Casey</span>―Kickham's brother. And they all went shares in it. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  But that was stealing. How could they have done that?
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Wells</span>―A fat lot you know about it, Thunder! Wells said. I know
 why they scut. </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">a fellow</span>―Tell us why. </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Wells</span>―I was told not to, Wells said. </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">all</span>―O, go on, Wells, all said. You might tell us. We won't let it
 out. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  Stephen bent forward his head to hear. Wells looked round
 to see if anyone was coming. Then he said secretly:
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Wells</span>―You know the altar wine they keep in the press in the sac-
 risty? </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">all</span>―Yes. </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Wells</span>―Well, they drank that and it was found out who did it by the
 smell. And that's why they ran away, if you want to know. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  And the fellow who had spoken first said:
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">a fellow</span>―Yes, that's what I heard too from the fellow in the higher
 line. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  The fellows were all silent. Stephen stood among them,
 afraid to speak, listening. A faint sickness of awe made him feel
 weak. How could they have done that? He thought of the dark
 silent sacristy. There were dark wooden presses there where the
 crimped surplices lay quietly folded. It was not the chapel but
 still you had to speak under your breath. It was a holy place.
 He remembered the summer evening he had been there to be
 dressed as boatbearer, the evening of the procession to the little
 altar in the wood. A strange and holy place. The boy that held
 the censer had swung it gently to and fro near the door with the
 silvery cap lifted by the middle chain to keep the coals lighting.
 That was called charcoal: and it had burned quietly as the
 fellow had swung it gently and had given off a weak sour smell.
 And then when all were vested he had stood holding out the
 boat to the rector and the rector had put a spoonful of incense
 in  and it had hissed on the red coals.</p>
<p class="textParagraph">  The fellows were talking together in little groups here and
 there on the playground. The fellows seemed to him to have
 grown smaller: that was because a sprinter had knocked him
 down the day before, a fellow out of second of grammar. He
 had been thrown by the fellow's machine lightly on the cinder-
 path and his spectacles had been broken in three pieces and
 some of the grit of the cinders had gone into his mouth.</p>
<p class="textParagraph">  That was why the fellows seemed to him smaller and farther
 away and the goalposts so thin and far and the soft grey sky so
 high up. But there was no play on the football grounds for
 cricket was coming: and some said that Barnes would be the
 prof and some said it would be Flowers. And all over the play-
 playgrounds they were playing rounders and bowling twisters and
 lobs. And from here and from there came the sounds of the
 cricket bats through the soft grey air. They said: pick, pack,
 pock, puck: like drops of water in a fountain slowly falling in
 the brimming bowl.</p>
<p class="textParagraph">  Athy, who had been silent, said quietly:
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Athy</span>―You are all wrong. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  All turned towards him eagerly.
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">a fellow</span>―Why? </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">a fellow</span>―Do you know? </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">a fellow</span>―Who told you? </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">a fellow</span>―Tell us, Athy. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  Athy pointed across the playground to where Simon
 Moonan was walking by himself kicking a stone before him.
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Athy</span>―Ask him, he said. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  The fellows looked there and then said:
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">a fellow</span>―Why him? </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">a fellow</span>―Is he in it? </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">a fellow</span>―Tell us, Athy. Go on. You might if you know. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  Athy lowered his voice and said:
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Athy</span>―Do you know why those fellows scut? I will tell you but you
 must not let on you know. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  He paused for a moment and then said mysteriously:
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Athy</span>―They were caught with Simon Moonan and Tusker Boyle in
 the square one night. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  The fellows looked at him and asked:
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">a fellow</span>―Caught? </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">a fellow</span>―What doing? </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  Athy said:
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Athy</span>―Smugging. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  All the fellows were silent: and Athy said:
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Athy</span>―And that's why. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  Stephen looked at the faces of the fellows but they were all
 looking across the playground. He wanted to ask somebody
 about it. What did that mean about the smugging in the
 square? Why did the five fellows out of the higher line run
 away for that? It was a joke, he thought. Simon Moonan had
 nice clothes and one night he had shown him a ball of creamy
 sweets that the fellows of the football fifteen had rolled down
 to him along the carpet in the middle of the refectory when he
 was at the door. It was the night of the match against the
 Bective Rangers and the ball was made just like a red and green
 apple only it opened and it was full of the creamy sweets. And
 one day Boyle had said that an elephant had two tuskers in-
 instead of two tusks and that was why he was called Tusker
 Boyle but some fellows called him Lady Boyle because he was
 always at his nails, paring them.</p>
<p class="textParagraph">  Eileen had long thin cool white hands too because she was a
 girl. They were like ivory; only soft. That was the meaning of
 <span class="emph">Tower of Ivory</span> but protestants could not understand it and
 made fun of it. One day he had stood beside her looking into
 the hotel grounds. A waiter was running up a trail of bunting
 on the flagstaff and a fox terrier was scampering to and fro on
 the sunny lawn. She had put her hand into his pocket where his
 hand was and he had felt how cool and thin and soft her hand
 was. She had said that pockets were funny things to have: and
 then all of a sudden she had broken away and had run laughing
 down the sloping curve of the path. Her fair hair had streamed
 out behind her like gold in the sun. <span class="emph">Tower of Ivory. House of
 Gold.</span> By thinking about things you could understand them.</p>
<p class="textParagraph">  But why in the square? You went there when you wanted to
 do something. It was all thick slabs of slate and water trickled
 all day out of tiny pinholes and there was a queer smell of stale
 water there. And behind the door of one of the  closets there
 was a drawing in red pencil of a bearded man in a Roman dress
 with a brick in each hand and underneath was the name of the
 drawing:</p>
<p class="textParagraph">  <span class="emph">Balbus was building a wall.</span> <br> </p>
<p class="textParagraph">  Some fellow had drawn it there for a cod. It had a funny
 face but it was very like a man with a beard. And on the wall of
 another closet there was written in backhand  in beautiful writ-
 ing:</p>
<p class="textParagraph">  Julius Caesar wrote The Calico Belly. <br> </p>
<p class="textParagraph">  Perhaps that was why they were there  because it was a place
 where some fellows wrote things for cod. But all the same it
 was queer what Athy said and the way he said it. It was not a
 cod because they had run away. He looked with the others in
 silence across the playground and began to feel afraid.</p>
<p class="textParagraph">  At last Fleming said:
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Fleming</span>―And we are all to be punished for what other fellows did? </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Cecil Thunder</span>―I won't come back, see if I do, Cecil Thunder said. Three
 days' silence in the refectory and sending us up for six and eight
 every minute. </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Wells</span>―Yes, said Wells. And old Barrett has a new way of twisting
 the note so that you can't open it and fold it again to see how
 many ferul#.ä  you are to get. I won't come back too. </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Cecil Thunder</span>―Yes, said Cecil Thunder, and the prefect of studies was in
 second of grammar this morning. </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Fleming</span>―Let us get up a rebellion, Fleming said. Will we? </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  All the fellows were silent. The air was very silent and you
 could hear the cricket bats but more slowly than before: pick,
 pock.</p>
<p class="textParagraph">  Wells asked:
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Wells</span>―What is going to be done to them? </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Athy</span>―Simon Moonan and Tusker are going to be flogged, Athy
 said, and the fellows in the higher line got their choice of
 flogging or being expelled. </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">a fellow</span>―And which are they taking? asked the fellow who had
 spoken first. </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Athy</span>―All are taking expulsion except Corrigan, Athy answered.
 He's going to be flogged by Mr Gleeson. </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Fleming</span>―Is it Corrigan that big fellow? said Fleming. Why, he'd be
 able for two of Gleeson! </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Cecil Thunder</span>―I know why, Cecil Thunder said. He is right and the other
 fellows are wrong because a flogging wears off after a bit but a
 fellow that has been expelled from college is known all his life
 on  account of it. Besides Gleeson won't flog him hard. </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Fleming</span>―It's best of his play not to, Fleming said. </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Cecil Thunder</span>―I wouldn't like to be Simon Moonan and Tusker,  Cecil
 Thunder said. But I don't believe they will be flogged. Perhaps
 they will be sent up for twice nine. </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Athy</span>―No, no, said Athy. They'll both get it on the vital spot. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  Wells rubbed himself and said in a crying voice:
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Wells</span>―Please, sir, let me off! </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  Athy grinned and turned up the sleeves of his jacket, saying:
<p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Athy</span> 
<p class="lg">
 It can't be helped;<br>
 It must be done.<br>
 So down with your breeches<br>
 And out with your bum.<br>
</p>
 </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  The fellows laughed; but he felt that they were a little afraid.
 In the silence of the soft grey air he heard the cricket bats from
 here and from there: pock. That was a sound to hear but if you
 were hit then you would feel a pain. The pandybat made a
 sound too but not like that. The fellows said it was made of
 whalebone and leather with lead inside: and he wondered what
 was the pain like. There were different kinds of pains  for all the
 different kinds of sounds. A long thin cane would have a high
 whistling sound and he wondered what was that pain like. It
 made him shivery to think of it and cold: and what Athy said
 too. But what was there to laugh at in it? It made him shivery:
 but that was because you always felt like a shiver when you let
 down your trousers. It was the same in the bath when you
 undressed yourself. He wondered who had to let them down,
 the master or the boy himself. O how could they laugh about it
 that way?</p>
<p class="textParagraph">  He looked at Athy's rolledup sleeves and knuckly inky
 hands. He had rolled up his sleeves to show how Mr Gleeson
 would roll up his sleeves. But Mr Gleeson had round shiny
 cuffs and clean white wrists and fattish white hands and the
 nails of them were long and pointed. Perhaps he pared them
 too like Lady Boyle. But they were terribly long and pointed
 nails. So long and cruel they were though the white fattish
 hands were not cruel but gentle. And though he trembled with
 cold and fright to think of the cruel long nails and of the high
 whistling sound of the cane and of the chill you felt at the end
 of your shirt when you undressed yourself yet he felt a feeling
 of queer quiet pleasure inside him to think of the white fattish
 hands, clean and strong  and gentle. And he thought of what
 Cecil Thunder had said; that Mr Gleeson would not flog Cor-
 Corrigan hard. And Fleming had said he would not because it was
 best of his play not to. But that was not why.</p>
<p class="textParagraph">  A voice from far out on the playgrounds cried:
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">a fellow</span>―All in! </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  And other voices cried:
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">other voices</span>―All in! All in! </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  During the writing lesson he sat with his arms folded, listen-
 ing to the slow scraping of the pens. Mr Harford went to and
 fro making little signs in red pencil and sometimes sitting
 beside the boy to show him how to hold the pen. He had tried
 to spell out the headline for himself though he knew already
 what it was for it was the last in the book. <span class="emph">Zeal without
 prudence is like a ship adrift.</span> But the lines of the letters were
 like fine invisible threads and it was only by closing his right
 eye tight tight and staring out of the left eye that he could make
 out the full curves of the capital.</p>
<p class="textParagraph">  But Mr Harford was very decent and never got into a wax.
 All the other masters got into dreadful waxes. But why were
 they to suffer for what fellows in the higher line did? Wells had
 said that they had drunk some of the altar wine out of the press
 in the sacristy and that it had been found out who had done it
 by the smell. Perhaps they had stolen a monstrance to run away
 with it and sell it somewhere. That must have been a terrible
 sin, to go in  quietly there at night, to open the dark press and
 steal the flashing gold thing into which God was put on the
 altar in the middle of flowers and candles at benediction while
 the incense went up in clouds at both sides as the fellow swung
 the censer and Dominic Kelly sang the first part by himself in
 the choir. But God was not in it of course when they stole it.
 But still it was a strange and a great sin even to touch it. He
 thought of it with deep awe; a terrible and strange sin: it
 thrilled him to think of it in the silence when the pens scraped
 lightly. But to drink the altar wine out of the press and be
 found out by the smell was a sin too: but it was not terrible
 and strange. It only made you feel a little sickish on account
 of the smell of the wine. Because on the day when he had
 made his first holy communion in  the chapel he had shut his
 eyes and opened his mouth and put out his tongue a little: and
 when the rector had stooped down to give him the holy com-
 communion he had smelt a faint winy smell off the rector's breath
 after the wine of the mass. The word was beautiful: wine. It
 made you think of dark purple because the grapes were dark
 purple that grew in Greece outside houses like white temples.
 But the faint smell off the rector's breath had made him feel
 a sick feeling on the morning of his first communion. The day
 of your first communion was the happiest day of your life.
 And once a lot of generals had asked Napoleon what was the
 happiest day of his life. They thought he would say the day
 he won some great battle or the day he was made an emperor.
 But he said:
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Napoleon</span>―Gentlemen, the happiest day of my life was the day on which
 I made my first holy communion. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  Father Arnall came in and the Latin lesson began and he
 remained still, leaning on the desk with his arms folded. Father
 Arnall gave out the themebooks and he said that they were
 scandalous and that they were all to be written out again with
 the corrections at once. But the worst of all was Fleming's
 theme because the pages were stuck together by a blot: and
 Father Arnall held it up by a corner and said it was an insult to
 any master to send him up such a theme. Then he asked Jack
 Lawton to decline the noun <span class="emph">mare</span> and Jack Lawton stopped at
 the ablative singular and could not go on with the plural.
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Arnall</span>―You should be ashamed of yourself, said Father Arnall
 sternly. You, the leader of the class! </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  Then he asked the next boy and the next and the next.
 Nobody knew. Father Arnall became very quiet, more and
 more quiet as each boy tried to answer and could not. But his
 face was blacklooking and his eyes were staring though his
 voice was so quiet. Then he asked Fleming and Fleming said
 that that word had no plural. Father Arnall suddenly shut the
 book and shouted at him:
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Arnall</span>―Kneel out there in the middle of the class. You are one of the
 idlest boys I ever met. Copy out your themes again the rest of
 you. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  Fleming moved heavily out of his place and knelt between
 the two last benches. The other boys bent over their theme-
 books and began to write. A silence filled the classroom and
 Stephen, glancing timidly at Father Arnall's dark face, saw that
 it was a little red from the wax he was in.</p>
<p class="textParagraph">  Was that a sin for Father Arnall to be in a wax or was he
 allowed to get into a wax when the boys were idle because that
 made them study better or was he only letting on to be in a
 wax? It was because he was allowed because a priest would
 know what a sin was and would not do it. But if he did it one
 time by mistake what would he do to go to confession? Perhaps
 he would go to confession to the minister. And if the minister
 did it he would go to the rector: and the rector to the provin-
 cial: and the provincial to the general of the jesuits. That was
 called the order: and he had heard his father say that they were
 all clever men. They could all have become highup people in
 the world if they had not become jesuits. And he wondered
 what Father Arnall and Paddy Barrett would have become and
 what Mr McGlade and Mr Gleeson would have become if they
 had not become jesuits. It was hard to think what because you
 would have to think of them in a different way with different
 coloured coats and trousers and with beards and moustaches
 and different kinds of hats.</p>
<p class="textParagraph">  The door opened quietly and closed. A quick whisper ran
 through the class: the prefect of studies. There was an instant
 of dead silence and then the loud crack of a pandybat on the
 last desk. Stephen's heart leapt up in fear.
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Dolan</span>―Any boys want flogging here, Father Arnall? cried the pre-
 fect of studies. Any lazy idle loafers that want flogging in this
 class? </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  He came to the middle of the class and saw Fleming on his
 knees.
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Dolan</span>―Hoho! he cried. Who is this boy? Why is he on his knees?
 What is your name, boy? </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Fleming</span>―Fleming, sir. </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Dolan</span>―Hoho, Fleming! An idler of course. I can see it in your eye.
 Why is he on his knees, Father Arnall? </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Arnall</span>―He wrote a bad Latin theme, Father Arnall said, and he
 missed all the questions in grammar. </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Dolan</span>―Of course he did! cried the prefect of studies. Of course he
 did! A born idler! I can see it in the corner of his eye. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  He banged his pandybat down on the desk and cried:
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Dolan</span>―Up, Fleming! Up, my boy! </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  Fleming stood up slowly.
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Dolan</span>―Hold out! cried the prefect of studies. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  Fleming held out his hand. The pandybat came down on it
 with a loud smacking sound: one, two, three, four, five, six.
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Dolan</span>―Other hand! </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  The pandybat came down again in six loud quick smacks.
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Dolan</span>―Kneel down! cried the prefect of studies. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  Fleming knelt down squeezing his hands under his armpits,
 his face contorted with pain, but Stephen knew how hard his
 hands were because Fleming was always rubbing rosin into
 them. But perhaps he was in great pain for the noise of the
 pandies was terrible. Stephen's heart was beating and flutter-
 ing.
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Dolan</span>―At your work, all of you! shouted the prefect of studies. We
 want no lazy idle loafers here, lazy idle little schemers. At your
 work, I tell you. Father Dolan will be in to see you every day.
 Father Dolan will be in tomorrow. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  He poked one of the boys in the side with the pandybat,
 saying:
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Dolan</span>―You, boy! When will Father Dolan be in again? </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Tom Furlong</span>―Tomorrow, sir, said Tom Furlong's voice. </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Dolan</span>―Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow, said the prefect of
 studies. Make up your minds for that. Every day Father Dolan.
 Write away. You, boy, who are you? </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  Stephen's heart jumped suddenly.
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen</span>―Dedalus, sir. </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Dolan</span>―Why are you not writing like the others? </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen</span>―I ..... my ... </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  He could not speak with fright.
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Dolan</span>―Why is he not writing, Father Arnall? </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Arnall</span>―He broke his glasses, said Father Arnall, and I exempted him
 from work. </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Dolan</span>―Broke? What is this I hear? What is this your name is? said
 the prefect of studies. </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen</span>―Dedalus, sir. </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Dolan</span>―Out here, Dedalus. Lazy little schemer. I see schemer in your
 face. Where did you break your glasses? </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  Stephen stumbled into the middle of the class, blinded by
 fear and haste.
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Dolan</span>―Where did you break your glasses? repeated the prefect of
 studies. </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen</span>―The cinderpath, sir. </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Dolan</span>―Hoho! The cinderpath! cried the prefect of studies. I know
 that trick. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  Stephen lifted his eyes in wonder and saw for a moment
 Father Dolan's whitegrey not young face, his baldy whitegrey
 head with fluff at the sides of it, the steel rims of his spectacles
 and his nocoloured eyes looking through the glasses. Why did
 he say that he knew that trick?
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Dolan</span>―Lazy idle little loafer! cried the prefect of studies. Broke my
 glasses! An old schoolboy trick! Out with your hand this mo-
 moment! </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  Stephen closed his eyes and held out in the air his trembling
 hand with the palm upwards. He felt the prefect of studies
 touch it for a moment at the fingers to straighten it and then
 the swish of the sleeve of the soutane as the pandybat was lifted
 to strike. A hot burning stinging tingling blow like the loud
 crack of a broken stick made his trembling hand crumple to-
 together like a leaf in the fire: and at the sound and the pain
 scalding tears were driven into his eyes. His whole body was
 shaking with fright, his arm was shaking and his crumpled
 burning livid hand shook like a loose leaf in the air. A cry
 sprang to his lips, a prayer to be let off. But though the tears
 scalded his eyes and his limbs quivered with pain and fright he
 held back the hot tears and the cry that scalded his throat.
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Dolan</span>―Other hand! shouted the prefect of studies. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  Stephen drew back his maimed and quivering right arm and
 held out his left hand. The soutane sleeve swished again as the
 pandybat was lifted and a loud crashing sound and a fierce
 maddening tingling burning pain made his hand shrink to-
 together with the palms and fingers in a livid quivering mass. The
 scalding water burst forth from his eyes and, burning with
 shame and agony and fear, he drew back his shaking arm in
 terror and burst out into a whine of pain. His body shook with
 a palsy of fright and in shame and rage he felt the scalding cry
 come from his throat and the scalding tears falling out of his
 eyes and down his flaming cheeks.
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Dolan</span>―Kneel down! cried the prefect of studies. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  Stephen knelt down quickly pressing his beaten hands to his
 sides. To think of them  beaten and swollen with pain all in a
 moment made him feel so sorry for them as if they were not his
 own but someone else's that he felt so sorry for. And as he
 knelt, calming the last sobs in his throat and feeling the burning
 tingling pain pressed in to his sides, he thought of the hands
 which he had held out in the air with the palms up and of the
 firm touch of the prefect of studies when he had steadied the
 shaking fingers and of the beaten swollen reddened mass of
 palm and fingers that shook helplessly  in the air.
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Dolan</span>―Get at your work, all of you, cried the prefect of studies
 from the door. Father Dolan will be in every day to see if any
 boy, any lazy idle little loafer wants flogging. Every day. Every
 day. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  The door closed behind him.</p>
<p class="textParagraph">  The hushed class continued to copy out the themes. Father
 Arnall rose from his seat and went among them, helping the
 boys with gentle words and telling them the mistakes they had
 made. His voice was very gentle and soft. Then he returned to
 his seat and said to Fleming and Stephen:
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Arnall</span>―You may return to your places, you two. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  Fleming and Stephen rose and, walking to their seats, sat
 down. Stephen, scarlet with shame, opened a book quickly
 with one weak hand and bent down upon it, his face close to
 the page.</p>
<p class="textParagraph">  It was unfair and cruel: because the doctor had told him not
 to read without glasses and he had written home to his father
 that morning to send him a new pair. And Father Arnall had
 said that he need not study till the new glasses came. Then to
 be called a schemer before the class and to be pandied when he
 always got the card for first or second and was the leader of the
 Yorkists! How could the prefect of studies know that it was a
 trick? He felt the touch of the prefect's fingers as they had
 steadied his hand and at first he had thought that he was going
 to shake hands with him because the fingers were soft and firm:
 but then in an instant he had heard the swish of the soutane
 sleeve and the crash. It was cruel and unfair to make him kneel
 in the middle of the class then: and Father Arnall had told them
 both that they might return to their places without making any
 difference between them. He listened to Father Arnall's low
 and gentle voice as he corrected the themes. Perhaps he was
 sorry now and wanted to be decent. But it was unfair and cruel.
 The prefect of studies was a priest but that was cruel and
 unfair. And his whitegrey face and the nocoloured eyes behind
 the steelrimmed spectacles were cruel looking because he had
 steadied the hand first with his firm soft fingers and that was to
 hit it better and louder.
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Fleming</span>―It's a stinking mean thing, that's what it is, said Fleming in
 the corridor as the classes were passing out in file to the refec-
 tory, to pandy a fellow for what is not his fault. </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Nasty Roche</span>―You really broke your glasses by accident, didn't you? Nasty
 Roche asked. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  Stephen felt his heart filled by Fleming's words and did not
 answer.
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Fleming</span>―Of course he did! said Fleming. I wouldn't stand it. I'd go up
 and tell the rector on him. </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Cecil Thunder</span>―Yes, said Cecil Thunder eagerly, and I saw him lift the
 pandybat over his shoulder and he's not allowed to do that. </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Nasty Roche</span>―Did they hurt much? Nasty Roche asked. </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen</span>―Very much, Stephen said. </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Fleming</span>―I wouldn't stand it, Fleming repeated, from Baldyhead or
 any other Baldyhead. It's a stinking mean low trick, that's what
 it is. I'd go up straight up to the rector and tell him about it
 after dinner. </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Cecil Thunder</span>―Yes, do. Yes, do, said Cecil Thunder. </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Nasty Roche</span>―Yes, do. Yes, go up and tell the rector on him, Dedalus, said
 Nasty Roche, because he said that he'd come in tomorrow
 again to pandy you. </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">all</span>―Yes, yes. Tell the rector, all said. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  And there were some fellows out of second of grammar lis-
 listening and one of them said:
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">some fellows out of second of grammar</span>―The senate and the Roman people declared that Dedalus had
 been wrongly punished. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  It was wrong; it was unfair and cruel: and, as he sat in the
 refectory, he suffered time after time in memory the same hu-
 humiliation until he began to wonder whether it might not really
 be that there was something in his face which made him look
 like a schemer and he wished he had a little mirror to see. But
 there could not be; and it was unjust and cruel and unfair.</p>
<p class="textParagraph">  He could not eat the blackish fish fritters they got on
 Wednesdays in lent and one of his potatoes had the mark of the
 spade in it. Yes, he would do what the fellows had told him. He
 would go up and tell the rector that he had been wrongly
 punished. A thing like that had been done before by somebody
 in history, by some great person whose head was in the books
 of history. And the rector would declare that he had been
 wrongly punished because the senate and the Roman people
 always declared that the man who did that had been wrongly
 punished. Those were the great men whose names were in
 Richmal Magnall's Questions. History was all about those men
 and what they did and that was what Peter Parley's Tales about
 Greece and Rome were all about. Peter Parley himself was on
 the first page in a picture. There was a road over a heath with
 grass at the side and little bushes: and Peter Parley had a broad
 hat like a protestant minister and a big stick and he was walk-
 ing fast along the road to <span class="hide">39.074208 21.824312</span>Greece and
<span class="hide">41.902783 12.496366</span>Rome.</p>
<p class="textParagraph">  It was easy what he had to do. All he had to do  was when
 the dinner was over and he came out in his turn to go on
 walking but not out to the corridor but up the staircase on the
 right that led to the castle. He had nothing to do but that: to
 turn to the right and walk fast up the staircase and in half a
 minute he would be in the low dark narrow corridor that led
 through the castle to the rector's room. And every fellow had
 said that it was unfair, even the fellow out of second of gram-
 mar who had said that about the senate and the Roman people.</p>
<p class="textParagraph">  What would happen? He heard the fellows of the higher line
 stand up at the top of the refectory and heard their steps as
 they came down the matting: Paddy Rath and Jimmy Magee
 and the Spaniard and the Portuguese and the fifth was big
 Corrigan who was going to be flogged by Mr Gleeson. That
 was why the prefect of studies had called him a schemer and
 pandied him for nothing: and, straining his weak eyes, tired
 with the tears, he watched big Corrigan's broad shoulders and
 big hanging black head passing in the file. But he had done
 something and besides Mr Gleeson would not flog him hard:
 and he remembered how big Corrigan looked in the bath. He
 had skin the same colour as the turfcoloured bogwater in the
 shallow end of the bath and when he walked along the side his
 feet slapped loudly on the wet tiles and at every step his thighs
 shook a little because he was fat.</p>
<p class="textParagraph">  The refectory was half empty and the fellows were still
 passing out in file. He could go up the staircase because there
 was never a priest or a prefect outside the refectory door. But
 he could not go. The rector would side with the prefect of
 studies and think it was a schoolboy trick and then the prefect
 of studies would come in every day the same only it would be
 worse because he would be dreadfully waxy at any fellow
 going up to the rector about him. The fellows had told him to
 go but they would not go themselves. They had forgotten all
 about it. No, it was best to forget all about it: and perhaps the
 prefect of studies had only said he would come in. No, it was
 best to hide out of the way because when you were small and
 young you could often escape that way.</p>
<p class="textParagraph">  The fellows at his table stood up. He stood up and passed
 out among them in the file. He had to decide. He was coming
 near the door. If he went on with the fellows he could never go
 up to the rector because he could not leave the playground for
 that. And if he went and was pandied all the same all the
 fellows would make fun and talk about young Dedalus going
 up to the rector to tell on the prefect of studies.</p>
<p class="textParagraph">  He was walking down along the matting and he saw the
 door before him. It was impossible: he could not. He thought
 of the baldy head of the prefect of studies with the cruel no-
 nocoloured eyes looking at him and he heard the voice of the
 prefect of studies asking him twice what his name was. Why
 could he not remember the name when he was told the first
 time? Was he not listening the first time or was it to make fun
 out of the name? The great men in the history had names like
 that and nobody made fun of them. It was his own name that
 he should have made fun of if he wanted to make fun. Dolan: it
 was like the name of a woman that washed clothes.</p>
<p class="textParagraph">  He had reached the door and, turning quickly  to the right,
 walked up the stairs: and, before he could make up his mind to
 come back, he had entered the low dark narrow corridor that
 led to the castle. And as he crossed the threshold of the door of
 the corridor  he saw, without turning his head to look, that all
 the fellows were looking after him as they went filing by.</p>
<p class="textParagraph">  He passed along the narrow dark corridor, passing little
 doors that were the doors of the rooms of the community. He
 peered in front of him and right and left through the gloom and
 thought that those must be portraits. It was dark and silent and
 his eyes were weak and tired with tears so that he could not
 see. But he thought they were the portraits of the saints and
 great men of the order who were looking down on him silently
 as he passed: saint Ignatius Loyola holding an open book and
 pointing to the words Ad Majorem Dei Gloriam in it, saint
 Francis Xavier pointing to his chest, Lorenzo Ricci with his
 berretta on his head like one of the prefects of the lines, the
 three patrons of holy youth, saint Stanislaus Kostka, saint
 Aloysius Gonzaga and blessed John Berchmans, all with young
 faces because they died when they were young, and Father
 Peter Kenny sitting in a chair wrapped in a big cloak.</p>
<p class="textParagraph">  He came out on the landing above the entrance hall and
 looked about him. That was where Hamilton Rowan had
 passed and the marks of the soldiers' slugs were there. And it
 was there that the old servants had seen the ghost in the white
 cloak of a marshal.</p>
<p class="textParagraph">  An old servant was sweeping at the end of the landing. He
 asked him where was the rector's room and the old servant
 pointed to the door at the far end and looked after him as he
 went on to it and knocked.</p>
<p class="textParagraph">  There was no answer. He knocked again more loudly and
 his heart jumped when he heard a muffled voice say:
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">the rector</span>―Come in! </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  He turned the handle and opened the door and fumbled for
 the handle of the green baize door inside. He found it and
 pushed it open and went in.</p>
<p class="textParagraph">  He saw the rector sitting at a desk writing. There was a skull
 on the desk and a strange solemn smell in the room like the old
 leather of chairs.</p>
<p class="textParagraph">  His heart was beating fast on account of the solemn place he
 was in and the silence of the room:  and he looked at the skull
 and at the rector's kindlooking face.
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">the rector</span>―Well, my little man, said the rector. What is it? </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  Stephen swallowed down the thing in his throat and said:
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen</span>―I broke my glasses, sir. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  The rector opened his mouth and said:
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">the rector</span>―O! </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  Then he smiled and said:
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">the rector</span>―Well, if we broke our glasses we must write home for a new
 pair. </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen</span>―I wrote home, sir, said Stephen, and Father Arnall said I am
 not to study till they come. </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">the rector</span>―Quite right! said the rector. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  Stephen swallowed down the thing again  and tried to keep
 his legs and his voice from shaking.
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen</span>―But, sir .... </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">the rector</span>―Yes? </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen</span>―Father Dolan came in today and pandied me because I was
 not writing my theme. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  The rector looked at him in silence and he could feel the
 blood rising to his face and the tears about to rise to his eyes.</p>
<p class="textParagraph">  The rector said:
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">the rector</span>―Your name is Dedalus, isn't it? </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen</span>―Yes, sir. </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">the rector</span>―And where did you break your glasses? </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen</span>―On the cinderpath, sir. A fellow was coming out of the
 bicycle house and I fell and they got broken. I don't know the
 fellow's name. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  The rector looked at him again in silence. Then he smiled
 and said:
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">the rector</span>―O, well, it was a mistake. I am sure Father Dolan did not
 know. </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen</span>―But I told him I broke them, sir, and he pandied me. </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">the rector</span>―Did you tell him that you had written home for a new pair?
 the rector asked. </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen</span>―No, sir. </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">the rector</span>―O well then, said the rector, Father Dolan did not under-
 stand. You can say that I excuse you from your lessons for a
 few days. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  Stephen said quickly for fear his trembling would prevent
 him:
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen</span>―Yes, sir, but Father Dolan said he will come in tomorrow to
 pandy me again for it. </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">the rector</span>―Very well, the rector said. It is a mistake and I shall speak to
 Father Dolan myself. Will that do now? </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  Stephen felt the tears wetting his eyes and murmured:
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen</span>―O yes, sir, thanks. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  The rector held his hand across the side of the desk where
 the skull was and Stephen, placing his hand in it for a moment,
 felt a cool moist palm.
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">the rector</span>―Good day now, said the rector, withdrawing his hand and
 bowing. </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen</span>―Good day, sir, said Stephen. </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  He bowed and walked quietly out of the room, closing the
 doors carefully and slowly.</p>
<p class="textParagraph">  But when he had passed the old servant on the landing and
 was again in the low narrow dark corridor he began to walk
 faster and faster. Faster and faster he hurried on through the
 gloom, excitedly. He bumped his elbow against the door at the
 end and, hurrying down the staircase, walked quickly through
 the two corridors and out into the air.</p>
<p class="textParagraph">  He could hear the cries of the fellows on the playgrounds.
 He broke into a run and, running quicker and quicker, ran
 across the cinderpath and reached the third line playground,
 panting.</p>
<p class="textParagraph">  The fellows had seen him running. They closed round him in
 a ring, pushing one against another to hear.
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">the fellows</span>―Tell us! Tell us! </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">the fellows</span>―What did he say? </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">the fellows</span>―Did you go in? </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">the fellows</span>―What did he say? </p>
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">the fellows</span>―Tell us! Tell us! </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  He told them what he had said and what the rector had said
 and, when he had told them, all the fellows flung their caps
 spinning up into the air and cried:
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">the fellows</span>―Hurroo! </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  They caught their caps and sent them up again spinning
 skyhigh and cried again:
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">the fellows</span>―Hurroo! Hurroo! </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  They made a cradle of their locked hands and hoisted him
 up among them and carried him along till he struggled to get
 free. And when he had escaped from them they broke away in
 all directions, flinging their caps again into the air and whis-
 tling as they went spinning up and crying:
 <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">the fellows</span>―Hurroo! </p></p>
<p class="textParagraph">  And they gave three groans for Baldyhead Dolan and three
 cheers for Conmee and they said he was the decentest rector
 that was ever in Clongowes.</p>
<p class="textParagraph">  The cheers died away in the soft grey air. He was alone. He
 was happy and free: but he would not be anyway proud with
 Father Dolan. He would be very quiet and obedient: and he
 wished that he could do something kind for him to show him
 that he was not proud.</p>
<p class="textParagraph">  The air was soft and grey and mild and evening was coming.
 There was the smell of evening in the air, the smell of the fields
 in the country where they digged up turnips to peel them and
 eat them when they went out for a walk to <span class="hide">53.257926 -6.585225</span>Major Barton's, the
 smell there was in the little wood beyond the pavilion where
 the gallnuts were.</p>
<p class="textParagraph">  The fellows were practising long shies and bowling lobs and
 slow twisters. In the soft grey silence he could hear the bump of
 the balls: and from here and from there through the quiet air
 the sound of the cricket bats: pick, pack, pock, puck: like drops
 of water in a fountain falling softly in the brimming bowl.</p>

	 

 

 
  <h2 class="heading">II<br>
</h2>
  <p class="textParagraph">  Uncle Charles smoked such black twist that at last his out-
  spoken nephew suggested to him to enjoy his morning smoke
  in a little outhouse at the end of the garden.
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Uncle Charles</span>―Very good, Simon. All serene, Simon, said the old man tran-
  quilly. Anywhere you like. The outhouse will do me nicely: it
  will be more salubrious.</p>
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―Damn me, said Mr Dedalus frankly, if I know how you can
  smoke such villainous awful tobacco. It's like gunpowder, by
  God.</p>
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Uncle Charles</span>―It's very nice, Simon, replied the old man. Very cool and
  mollifying.</p></p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  Every morning, therefore, uncle Charles repaired to his out-
  house but not before he had creased and brushed scrupulously
  his back hair and brushed and put on his tall hat. While he
  smoked the brim of his tall hat and the bowl of his pipe were
  just visible beyond the jambs of the outhouse door. His arbour,
  as he called the reeking outhouse which he shared with the cat
  and the garden tools, served him also as a soundingbox: and
  every morning he hummed contentedly one of his favourite
  songs: <span class="emph">O, twine me a bower</span> or <span class="emph">Blue eyes and golden hair</span> or
  <span class="emph">The Groves of Blarney</span> while the grey and blue coils of smoke
  rose slowly from his pipe and vanished in the pure air.</p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  During the first part of the summer in Blackrock uncle
  Charles was Stephen's constant companion. Uncle Charles was
  a hale old man with a well tanned skin, rugged features and
  white side whiskers. On week days he did messages between
  the house in <span class="hide">53.293248, -6.180109</span>Carysfort Avenue and those shops in the main
  street of the town with which the family dealt. Stephen was
  glad to go with him on these errands for uncle Charles helped
  him very liberally to handfuls of whatever was exposed in open
  boxes and barrels outside the counter. He would seize a hand-
  ful of grapes and sawdust or three or four American apples and
  thrust them generously into his grandnephew's hand while the
  shopman smiled uneasily; and on Stephen's feigning reluctance
  to take them, he would frown and say:
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Uncle Charles</span>―Take them, sir. Do you hear me, sir? They're good for your
  bowels.</p></p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  When the order list had been booked the two would go on
  to the park where an old friend of Stephen's father, Mike
  Flynn, would be found seated on a bench, waiting for them.
  Then would begin Stephen's run round the park. Mike Flynn
  would stand at the gate near the railway station, watch in
  hand, while Stephen ran round the track in the style Mike
  Flynn favoured, his head high lifted, his knees well lifted and
  his hands held straight down by his sides. When the morning
  practice was over the trainer would make his comments and
  sometimes illustrate them by shuffling along for a yard or so
  comically in an old pair of blue canvas shoes. A small ring of
  wonderstruck children and nursemaids would gather to watch
  him and linger even when he and uncle Charles had sat down
  again and were talking athletics and politics. Though he had
  heard his father say that Mike Flynn had put some of the best
  runners of modern times through his hands Stephen often
  glanced with mistrust at his trainer's flabby stubblecovered
  face, as it bent over the long stained fingers through which he
  rolled his cigarette, and with pity at the mild lustreless blue
  eyes which would look up suddenly from the task and gaze
  vaguely into the bluer distance while the long swollen fingers
  ceased their rolling and grains and fibres of tobacco fell back
  into the pouch.</p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  On the way home uncle Charles would often pay a visit to
  the chapel and, as the font was above Stephen's reach, the old
  man would dip his hand and then sprinkle the water briskly
  about Stephen's clothes and on the floor of the porch. While he
  prayed he knelt on his red handkerchief and read above his
  breath from a thumbblackened prayerbook wherein catch-
  words were printed at the foot of every page. Stephen knelt at
  his side respecting, though he did not share, his piety. He often
  wondered what his granduncle prayed for so seriously. Perhaps
  he prayed for the souls in purgatory or for the grace of a happy
  death: or perhaps he prayed that God might send him back a
  part of the big fortune he had squandered in Cork.</p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  On Sundays Stephen with his father and his granduncle took
  their constitutional. The old man was a nimble walker in spite
  of his corns and often ten or twelve miles of the road were
  covered. The little village of <span class="hide">53.287857, -6.203573</span>Stillorgan was the parting of the
  ways. Either they went to the left towards the Dublin moun-
  tains or along the <span class="hide">53.297702, -6.233964</span>Goatstown road and thence
  into <span class="hide">53.289154, -6.243264</span>Dundrum,
  coming home by  <span class="hide">53.269979, -6.224923</span>Sandyford. Trudging along the road or
  standing in some grimy wayside publichouse his elders spoke
  constantly of the subjects nearest their hearts, of Irish politics,
  of Munster and of the legends of their own family, to all of
  which Stephen lent an avid ear. Words which he did not under-
  stand he said over and over to himself till he had learned them
  by heart: and through them he had glimpses of the real world
  about him. The hour when he too would take his part in the
  life of that world seemed drawing near and in secret he began
  to make ready for the great part which he felt awaited him the
  nature of which he only dimly apprehended.</p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  His evenings were his own; and he pored over a ragged
  translation of <span class="emph">The Count of Monte Cristo</span>. The figure of that
  dark avenger stood forth in his mind for whatever he had heard
  or divined in childhood of the strange and terrible. At night he
  built up on the parlour table an image of the wonderful island
  cave out of transfers and paper flowers and coloured tissue
  paper and strips of the silver and golden paper in which choc-
  olate is wrapped. When he had broken up this scenery, weary
  of its tinsel, there would come to his mind the bright picture of
   <span class="hide">43.295207,
  5.364077</span>Marseilles, of sunny trellisses and of Mercedes. Outside <span class="hide">53.300907,
  -6.177049</span>Black-
   rock, on the road that led to the mountains, stood a small
  whitewashed house in the garden of which grew many rose-
  bushes: and in this house, he told himself, another Mercedes
  lived. Both on the outward and on the homeward journey he
  measured distance by this landmark: and in his imagination he
  lived through a long train of adventures, marvellous as those in
  the book itself, towards the close of which there appeared an
  image of himself, grown older and sadder, standing in a
  moonlit garden with Mercedes who had so many years before
  slighted his love, and with a sadly proud gesture of refusal,
  saying:
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Count of Monte Cristo</span>―Madam, I never eat muscatel grapes.</p></p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  He became the ally of a boy named Aubrey Mills and
  founded with him a gang of adventurers in the avenue. Aubrey
  carried a whistle dangling from his buttonhole and a bicycle
  lamp attached to his belt while the others had short sticks
  thrust daggerwise through theirs. Stephen, who had read of
  Napoleon's plain style of dress, chose to remain unadorned and
  thereby heightened for himself the pleasure of taking counsel
  with his lieutenant before giving orders. The gang made forays
  into the gardens of old maids or went down to the castle and
  fought a battle on the shaggy weedgrown rocks, coming home
  after it weary stragglers with the stale odours of the foreshore
  in their nostrils and the rank oils of the seawrack upon their
  hands and in their hair.</p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  Aubrey and Stephen had a common milkman and often they
  drove out in the milkcar to <span class="hide">53.250224, -6.179926</span>Carrickmines where the cows were
  at grass. While the men were milking the boys would take turns
  in riding the tractable mare round the field. But when autumn
  came the cows were driven home from the grass: and the first
  sight of the filthy cowyard at <span class="hide">53.300791 -6.177067</span>Stradbrook with its foul green
  puddles and clots of liquid dung and steaming brantroughs
  sickened Stephen's heart. The cattle which had seemed so beau-
  tiful in the country on sunny days revolted him and he could
  not even look at the milk they yielded.</p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  The coming of September did not trouble him this year for
  he knew he was not to be sent back to <span class="hide">53.310770, -6.684719</span>Clongowes. The practice
  in the park came to an end when Mike Flynn went into hospi-
  tal. Aubrey was at school and had only an hour or two free in
  the evening. The gang fell asunder and there were no more
  nightly forays or battles on the rocks. Stephen sometimes went
  round with the car which delivered the evening milk: and these
  chilly drives blew away his memory of the filth of the cowyard
  and he felt no repugnance at seeing the cowhairs and hayseeds
  on the milkman's coat. Whenever the car drew up before a
  house he waited to catch a glimpse of a well scrubbed kitchen
  or of a softly lighted hall and to see how the servant would
  hold the jug and how she would close the door. He thought it
  should be a pleasant life enough, driving along the roads every
  evening to deliver milk, if he had warm gloves and a fat bag of
  gingernuts in his pocket to eat from. But the same foreknowl-
  edge which had sickened his heart and made his limbs sag
  suddenly as he raced round the park, the same intuition which
  had made him glance with mistrust at his trainer's flabby
  stubblecovered face as it bent heavily over his long stained
  fingers, dissipated any vision of the future. In a vague way he
  understood that his father was in trouble and that this was the
  reason why he himself had not been sent back to <span class="hide">53.310770, -6.684719</span>Clongowes.
  For some time he had felt the slight changes in his house; and
  these changes in what he had deemed unchangeable were so
  many slight shocks to his boyish conception of the world. The
  ambition which he felt astir at times in the darkness of his soul
  sought no outlet. A dusk like that of the outer world obscured
  his mind as he heard the mare's hoofs clattering along the
  tramtrack on the Rock Road and the great can swaying and
  rattling behind him.</p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  He returned to Mercedes and, as he brooded upon her im-
  age, a strange unrest crept into his blood. Sometimes a fever
  gathered within him and led him to rove alone in the evening
  along the quiet avenues. The peace of the gardens and the
  kindly lights in the windows poured a tender influence into his
  restless heart. The noise of children at play annoyed him and
  their silly voices made him feel, even more keenly than he had
  felt at <span class="hide">53.310770, -6.684719</span>Clongowes, that he was different from others. He did
  not want to play. He wanted to meet in the real world the
  unsubstantial image which his soul so constantly beheld. He
  did not know where to seek it or how: but a premonition which
  led him on told him that this image would, without any overt
  act of his, encounter him. They would meet quietly as if they
  had known each other and had made their tryst, perhaps at one
  of the gates or in some more secret place. They would be alone,
  surrounded by darkness and silence: and in that moment of
  supreme tenderness he would be transfigured. He would fade
  into something impalpable under her eyes and then, in a mo-
  ment, he would be transfigured. Weakness and timidity and
  inexperience would fall from him in that magic moment.</p>
  
 


  <p class="textParagraph">   Two great yellow caravans had halted one morning before
  the door and men had come tramping into the house to dis-
  mantle it. The furniture had been hustled out through the front
  garden which was strewn with wisps of straw and rope ends
  and into the huge vans at the gate. When all had been safely
  stowed the vans had set off noisily down the avenue: and from
  the window of the railway carriage, in which he had sat with
  his redeyed mother, Stephen had seen them lumbering heavily
  along the Merrion Road.</p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  The parlour fire would not draw that evening and Mr Deda-
  lus rested the poker against the bars of the grate to attract the
  flame. Uncle Charles dozed in a corner of the half furnished
  uncarpeted room and near him the family portraits leaned
  against the wall. The lamp on the table shed a weak light over
  the boarded floor, muddied by the feet of the vanmen. Stephen
  sat on a footstool beside his father listening to a long and
  incoherent monologue. He understood little or nothing of it at
  first but he became slowly aware that his father had enemies
  and that some fight was going to take place. He felt, too, that
  he was being enlisted for the fight, that some duty was being
  laid upon his shoulders. The sudden flight from the comfort
  and revery of <span class="hide">53.300907, -6.177049</span>Blackrock, the passage through the gloomy foggy
  city, the thought of the bare cheerless house in which they were
  now to live made his heart heavy: and again an intuition or
  foreknowledge of the future came to him. He understood also
  why the servants had often whispered together in the hall and
  why his father had often stood on the hearthrug, with his back
  to the fire, talking loudly to uncle Charles who urged him to sit
  down and eat his dinner.
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―There's a crack of the whip left in me yet, Stephen, old chap,
  said Mr Dedalus, poking at the dull fire with fierce energy.
  We're not dead yet, sonny. No, by the Lord Jesus (God forgive
  me) nor half dead. </p></p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  <span class="hide">53.349307, -6.263654</span>Dublin was a new and complex sensation. Uncle Charles
  had grown so witless that he could no longer be sent out on
  errands and the disorder in settling in the new house left Ste-
  phen freer than he had been in <span class="hide">53.300907, -6.177049</span>Blackrock. In the beginning he
  contented himself with circling timidly round the neighbouring
  square or, at most, going half way down one of the side streets:
  but when he had made a skeleton map of the city in his mind he
  followed boldly one of its central lines until he reached the
  customhouse. He passed unchallenged among the docks and
  along the quays wondering at the multitude of corks that lay
  bobbing on the surface of the water in a thick yellow scum, at
  the crowds of quay porters and the rumbling carts and the
  illdressed bearded policeman. The vastness and strangeness of
  the life suggested to him by the bales of merchandise stacked
  along the walls or swung aloft out of the holds of steamers
  wakened again in him the unrest which had sent him wan-
  dering in the evening from garden to garden in search of
  Mercedes. And amid this new bustling life he might have
  fancied himself in another <span class="hide">43.295207, 5.364077</span>Marseilles but that he missed the
  bright sky and the sunwarmed trellisses of the wineshops. A
  vague dissatisfaction grew up within him as he looked on the
  quays and on the river and on the lowering skies and yet he
  continued to wander up and down day after day as if he really
  sought someone that eluded him.</p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  He went once or twice with his mother to visit their rela-
  tives: and, though they passed a jovial array of shops lit up and
  adorned for Christmas, his mood of embittered silence did not
  leave him. The causes of his embitterment were many, remote
  and near. He was angry with himself for being young and the
  prey of restless foolish impulses, angry also with the change of
  fortune which was reshaping the world about him into a vision
  of squalor and insincerity. Yet his anger lent nothing to the
  vision. He chronicled with patience what he saw, detaching
  himself from it and tasting its mortifying flavour in secret.</p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  He was sitting on the backless chair in his aunt's kitchen. A
  lamp with a reflector hung on the japanned wall of the fire-
  place and by its light his aunt was reading the evening paper
  that lay on her knees. She looked a long time at a smiling
  picture that was set in it and said musingly:</p>
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">his aunt</span>―The beautiful Mabel Hunter!</p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  A ringletted girl stood on tiptoe to peer at the picture and
  said softly:
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">ringletted girl</span>―What is she in, mud? </p>
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">ringletted girl's mother</span>―In the pantomime, love. </p></p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  The child leaned her ringletted head against her mother's
  sleeve, gazing on the picture and murmured, as if fascinated:
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">ringletted girl</span>―The beautiful Mabel Hunter! </p></p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  As if fascinated, her eyes rested long upon those demurely
  taunting eyes and she murmured again devotedly:
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">ringletted girl</span>―Isn't she an exquisite creature? </p></p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  And the boy who came in from the street, stamping crook-
  edly under his stone of coal, heard her words. He dropped his
  load promptly on the floor and hurried to her side to see. But
  she did not raise her easeful head to let him see. He mauled the
  edges of the paper with his reddened and blackened hands,
  shouldering her aside and complaining that he could not see.</p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  He was sitting in the narrow breakfast room high up in the
  old darkwindowed house. The firelight flickered on the wall
  and beyond the window a spectral dusk was gathering upon the
  river. Before the fire an old woman was busy making tea and,
  as she bustled at her task, she told in a low voice of what the
  priest and the doctor had said. She told too of certain changes
  that she had seen in her of late and of her odd ways and
  sayings. He sat listening to the words and following the ways
  of adventure that lay open in the coals, arches and vaults and
  winding galleries and jagged caverns.</p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  Suddenly he became aware of something in the doorway. A
  skull appeared suspended in the gloom of the doorway. A
  feeble creature like a monkey was there, drawn thither by the
  sound of voices at the fire. A whining voice came from the
  door, asking:
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Ellen</span>―Is that Josephine? </p></p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  The old bustling woman answered cheerily from the fire-
  place:
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">old woman</span>―No, Ellen. It's Stephen. </p>
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Ellen</span>―O .... O, good evening, Stephen. </p></p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  He answered the greeting and saw a silly smile break out
  over the face in the doorway.
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">old woman</span>―Do you want anything, Ellen? asked the old woman at the
  fire.</p></p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  But she did not answer the question and said:
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Ellen</span>―I thought it was Josephine. I thought you were Josephine,
  Stephen.</p></p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  And, repeating this several times, she fell to laughing feebly.</p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  He was sitting in the midst of a children's party at <span class="hide">53.324608,
  -6.281580</span>Harold's
   Cross. His silent watchful manner had grown upon him and he
  took little part in the games. The children, wearing the spoils of
  their crackers, danced and romped noisily and, though he tried
  to share their merriment, he felt himself a gloomy figure amid
  the gay cocked hats and sunbonnets.</p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  But when he had sung his song and withdrawn into a snug
  corner of the room he began to taste the joy of his loneliness.
  The mirth, which in the beginning of the evening had seemed
  to him false and trivial, was like a soothing air to him, passing
  gaily by his senses, hiding from other eyes the feverish agitation
  of his blood while through the circling of the dancers and amid
  the music and laughter her glances travelled to his corner,
  flattering, taunting, searching, exciting his heart.</p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  In the hall the children who had stayed latest were putting
  on their things: the party was over. She had thrown a shawl
  about her and, as they went together towards the tram, sprays
  of her fresh warm breath flew gaily above her cowled head and
  her shoes tapped blithely on the glassy road.</p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  It was the last tram. The lank brown horses knew it and
  shook their bells to the clear night in admonition. The conductor
  tor talked with the driver, both nodding often in the green light
  of the lamp. On the empty seats of the tram were scattered a
  few coloured tickets. No sound of footsteps came up or down
  the road. No sound broke the peace of the night save when the
  lank brown horses rubbed their noses together and shook their
  bells.</p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  They seemed to listen, he on the upper step and she on the
  lower. She came up to his step many times and went down to
  hers again between their phrases and once or twice stood close
  beside him for some moments on the upper step, forgetting to
  go down, and then went down. His heart danced upon her
  movements like a cork upon a tide. He heard what her eyes
  said to him from beneath their cowl and knew that in some dim
  past, whether in life or in revery, he had heard their tale before.
  He saw her urge her vanities, her fine dress and sash and long
  black stockings, and knew that he had yielded to them a thou-
  sand times. Yet a voice within him spoke above the noise of his
  dancing heart, asking him would he take her gift to which he
  had only to stretch out his hand. And he remembered the day
  when he and Eileen had stood looking into the hotel grounds,
  watching the waiters running up a trail of bunting on the
  flagstaff and the foxterrier scampering to and fro on the sunny
  lawn, and how, all of a sudden, she had broken out into a peal
  of laughter and had run down the sloping curve of the path.
  Now, as then, he stood listlessly in his place, seemingly a
  tranquil watcher of the scene before him.</p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  --She too wants me to catch hold of her, he thought. That's
  why she came with me to the tram. I could easily catch hold of
  her when she comes up to my step: nobody is looking. I could
  hold her and kiss her.</p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  But he did neither: and, when he was sitting alone in the
  deserted tram, he tore his ticket into shreds and stared gloomily
  at the corrugated footboard.</p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  The next day he sat at his table in the bare upper room for
  many hours. Before him lay a new pen, a new bottle of ink and
  a new emerald exercise. From force of habit he had written at
  the top of the first page the initial letters of the jesuit motto:
  A. M. D. G. On the first line of the page appeared the title of
  the verses he was trying to write: To E-- C--. He knew it was
  right to begin so for he had seen similar titles in the collected
  poems of Lord Byron. When he had written this title and
  drawn an ornamental line underneath he fell into a daydream
  and began to draw diagrams on the cover of the book. He saw
  himself sitting at his table in Bray the morning after the dis-
  cussion at the Christmas dinnertable, trying to write a poem
  about Parnell on the back of one of his father's second moiety
  notices. But his brain had then refused to grapple with the
  theme and, desisting, he had covered the page with the names
  and addresses of certain of his classmates:
   Roderick Kickham
  John Lawton
  Anthony MacSwiney
  Simon Moonan</p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  Now it seemed as if he would fail again but, by dint of
  brooding on the incident, he thought himself into confidence.
  During this process all those elements which he deemed com-
  mon and insignificant fell out of the scene. There remained no
  trace of the tram itself nor of the trammen nor of the horses:
  nor did he and she appear vividly. The verses told only of the
  night and the balmy breeze and the maiden lustre of the moon.
  Some undefined sorrow was hidden in the hearts of the protag-
  onists as they stood in silence beneath the leafless trees and
  when the moment of farewell had come the kiss, which had
  been withheld by one, was given by both. After this the letters
  L. D. S. were written at the foot of the page and, having hidden
  the book, he went into his mother's bedroom and gazed at his
  face for a long time in the mirror of her dressingtable.</p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  But his long spell of leisure and liberty was drawing to its
  end. One evening his father came home full of news which kept
  his tongue busy all through dinner. Stephen had been awaiting
  his father's return for there had been mutton hash that day and
  he knew that his father would make him dip his bread in the
  gravy. But he did not relish the hash for the mention of
   <span class="hide">53.310770, -6.684719</span>Clongowes had coated his palate with a scum of disgust.
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―I walked bang into him, said Mr Dedalus for the fourth
  time, just at the corner of the square.</p>
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mary Dedalus</span>―Then I suppose, said Mrs Dedalus, he will be able to arrange
  it. I mean, about Belvedere.</p>
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―Of course  he will, said Mr Dedalus. Don't I tell you he's
  provincial of the order now? </p>
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mary Dedalus</span>―I never liked the idea of sending him to the christian brothers
  myself, said Mrs Dedalus. </p>
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―Christian brothers be damned! said Mr Dedalus. Is it with
  Paddy Stink and Mickey Mud? No, let him stick to the jesuits
  in God's name since he began with them. They'll be of service
  to him in after years. Those are the fellows that can get you a
  position.</p>
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mary Dedalus</span>―And they're a very rich order, aren't they, Simon? </p>
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―Rather. They live well, I tell you. You saw their table at
   <span class="hide">53.310770, -6.684719</span>Clongowes. Fed up, by God, like gamecocks. </p></p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  Mr Dedalus pushed his plate over to Stephen and bade him
  finish what was on it.
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―Now then, Stephen, he said. You must put your shoulder to
  the wheel, old chap. You've had a fine long holiday. </p>
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mary Dedalus</span>―O, I'm sure  he'll work very hard now, said Mrs Dedalus.
  Especially when he has Maurice with him. </p>
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―O, Holy Paul, I forgot about Maurice, said Mr Dedalus.
  Here, Maurice! Come here, you thickheaded ruffian! Do you
  know I'm going to send you to a college where they'll teach you
  to spell c.a.t: cat. And I'll buy you a nice little penny handker-
  chief to keep your nose dry. Won't that be grand fun? </p></p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  Maurice grinned at his father and then at his brother. Mr
  Dedalus screwed his glass into his eye and stared hard at both
  his sons. Stephen mumbled his bread without answering his
  father's gaze.
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―By the bye, said Mr Dedalus at length, the rector, or provin-
  cial, rather, was telling me that story about you and Father
  Dolan. You're an impudent thief, he said. </p>
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mary Dedalus</span>―O, he didn't, Simon! </p>
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―Not he! said Mr Dedalus. But he gave me a great account of
  the whole affair. We were chatting, you know, and one word
  borrowed another. And, by the way, who do you think he told
  me will get that job in the corporation? But I'll tell you that
  after. Well, as I was saying, we were chatting away quite
  friendly and he asked me did our friend here wear glasses still
  and then he told me the whole story. </p>
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mary Dedalus</span>―And was he annoyed, Simon? </p>
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―Annoyed! Not he! <span class="emph">Manly little chap!</span> he said. </p></p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  Mr Dedalus imitated the mincing nasal tone of the provin-
  cial.
  <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―Father Dolan and I, when I told them all at dinner about it,
  Father Dolan and I had a great laugh over it. <span class="emph">You better mind
  yourself, Father Dolan</span>, said I, <span class="emph">or young Dedalus will send you
  up for twice nine</span>. We had a famous laugh together over it. Ha!
  Ha! Ha!</p></p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  Mr Dedalus turned to his wife and interjected in his natural
  voice:
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―Shows you the spirit in which they take the boys there. O, a
  jesuit for your life, for diplomacy! </p></p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  He reassumed the provincial's voice and repeated:
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―<span class="emph">I told them all at dinner about it and Father Dolan and I and
  all of us we all had a hearty laugh together over it. Ha! Ha! Ha!</span></p></p>
     
  <p class="textParagraph">  The night of the Whitsuntide play had come and Stephen
  from the window of the dressingroom looked out on  the small
  grassplot across which lines of Chinese lanterns were stretched.
  He watched the visitors come down the steps from the house
  and pass into the theatre. Stewards in evening dress, old Belve-
  dereans, loitered in groups about the entrance to the theatre
  and ushered in the visitors with ceremony. Under the sudden
  glow of a lantern he could recognise the smiling face of a priest.</p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  The Blessed Sacrament had been removed from the taber-
  nacle and the first benches had been driven back so as to leave
  the dais of the altar and the space before it free. Against the
  walls stood companies of barbells and Indian clubs; the dumb-
  bells were piled in one corner: and in the midst of countless
  hillocks of gymnasium shoes and sweaters and singlets in
  untidy brown parcels there stood the stout leatherjacketed
  vaulting horse waiting its turn to be carried up on to the stage.
  A large bronze shield, tipped with silver, leaned against the
  panel of the altar also waiting its turn to be carried up on to the
  stage and set in the middle of the winning team at the end of
  the gymnastic  display.</p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  Stephen, though in deference to his reputation for essay-
  writing he had been elected secretary to the gymnasium, had }omit{ no
  part in the first section of the programme: but in the play
  which formed the second section he had the chief part, that of a
  farcical pedagogue. He had been cast for it on account of his
  stature and grave manners for he was now at the end of his
  second year at Belvedere and in number two.</p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  A score of the younger boys in white knickers and singlets
  came pattering down from the stage, through the vestry and
  into the chapel. The vestry and chapel were peopled with eager
  masters and boys. The plump bald sergeantmajor was testing
  with his foot the springboard of the vaulting horse. The lean
  young man in a long overcoat, who was to give a special
  display of intricate club swinging, stood near watching with
  interest, his silvercoated clubs peeping out of his deep side-
  pockets. The hollow rattle of the wooden dumbbells was heard
  as another team made ready to go up on the stage: and in
  another moment the excited prefect was hustling the boys
  through the vestry like a flock of geese, flapping the wings of
  his soutane nervously and crying to the laggards to make haste.
  A little troop  of Neapolitan peasants were practising their steps
  at the end of the chapel, some arching their arms above their
  heads, some swaying their baskets of paper violets and curtsey-
  ing. In a dark corner of the chapel at the gospel side of the altar
  a stout old lady knelt amid her copious black skirts. When she
  stood up a pinkdressed figure, wearing a curly golden wig and
  an oldfashioned straw sunbonnet, with black pencilled eye-
  brows and cheeks delicately rouged and powdered, was dis-
  covered. A low murmur of curiosity ran round the chapel at the
  discovery of this girlish figure. One of the prefects, smiling and
  nodding his head, approached the dark corner and, having
  bowed to the stout old lady, said pleasantly:
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">a prefect</span>―Is this a beautiful young lady or a doll that you have here,
  Mrs Tallon?</p></p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  Then, bending down to peer at the smiling painted face un-
  der the leaf of the bonnet, he exclaimed:
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">a prefect</span>―No! Upon my word I believe it's little Bertie Tallon after all! </p></p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  Stephen at his post by the window heard the old lady and
  the priest laugh together and heard the boys' murmur of ad-
  miration behind him as they pressed forward to see the little
  boy who had to dance the sunbonnet dance by himself. A
  movement of impatience escaped him. He let the edge of the
  blind fall and, stepping down from the bench on which he had
  been standing, walked out of the chapel.</p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  He passed out of the schoolhouse and halted under the shed
  that flanked the garden. From the theatre opposite came the
  muffled noise of the audience and sudden brazen clashes of the
  soldiers' band. The light spread upwards from the glass roof
  making the theatre seem a festive ark, anchored amid the hulks
  of houses, her frail cables of lanterns looping her to her moor-
  ings. A sidedoor of the theatre opened suddenly and a shaft of
  light flew across the grassplots. A sudden burst of music issued
  from the ark, the prelude of a waltz: and when the sidedoor
  closed again the listener could hear the faint rhythm of the
  music. The sentiment of the opening bars, their languor and
  supple movement, evoked the incommunicable emotion which
  had been the cause of all his day's unrest and of his impatient
  movement of a moment before. His unrest issued from him like
  a wave of sound: and on the tide of flowing music the ark was
  journeying, trailing her cables of lanterns in her wake. Then a
  noise like dwarf artillery broke the movement. It was the
  clapping that greeted the entry of the dumbbell team on the
  stage.</p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  At the far end of the shed near the street a speck of pink
  light showed in the darkness and as he walked towards it he
  became aware of a faint aromatic odour. Two boys were
  standing in the shelter of the doorway, smoking, and before he
  reached them he had recognised Heron by his voice.
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Heron</span>―Here comes the noble Dedalus! cried a high throaty voice.
  Welcome to our trusty friend! </p></p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  This welcome ended in a soft peal of mirthless laughter as
  Heron salaamed and then began to poke the ground with his
  cane.
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>―Here I am, said Stephen, halting and glancing from Heron to
  his friend. </p></p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  The latter was a stranger to him but in the darkness, by the
  aid of the glowing cigarette tips, he could make out a pale
  dandyish face, over which a smile was travelling slowly, a tall
  overcoated figure and a hard hat. Heron did not trouble him-
  self about an introduction but said instead:
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Heron</span>―I was just telling my friend Wallis what a lark it would be
  tonight if you took off the rector in the part of the school-
  master. It would be a ripping good joke. </p></p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  Heron made a poor attempt to imitate for his friend Wallis
  the rector's pedantic bass and then, laughing at his failure,
  asked Stephen to do it.
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Heron</span>―Go on, Dedalus, he urged. You can take him off rippingly.
  <p class="lg">
    He that will not hear the churcha let him be to theea as<br> the
    heathena and the publicana.<br>
  </p> </p></p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  The imitation was prevented by a mild expression of anger
  from Wallis in whose mouthpiece the cigarette had become too
  tightly wedged.
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Wallis</span>―Damn this blankety blank holder, he said, taking it from his
  mouth and smiling and frowning upon it tolerantly. It's always
  getting stuck like that. Do you use a holder? </p>
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>―I don't smoke, answered Stephen. </p>
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Heron</span>―No, said Heron, Dedalus is a model youth. He doesn't
  smoke and he doesn't go to bazaars and he doesn't flirt and he
  doesn't damn anything or damn all. </p></p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  Stephen shook his head and smiled in his rival's flushed and
  mobile face, beaked like a bird's. He had often thought it
  strange that Vincent Heron had a bird's face as well as a bird's
  name. A shock of pale hair lay on the forehead like a ruffled
  crest: the forehead was narrow and bony and a thin hooked
  nose stood out between the closeset prominent eyes which were
  light and inexpressive. The rivals were school friends. They sat
  together in class, knelt together in the chapel, talked together
  after beads over their lunches. As the fellows in number one
  were undistinguished dullards Stephen and Heron had been
  during the year the virtual heads of the school. It was they who
  went up to the rector together to ask for a free day or to get a
  fellow off.
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Heron</span>―O by the way, said Heron suddenly, I saw your governor
  going in. </p></p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  The smile waned on Stephen's face. Any allusion made to his
  father by a fellow or by a master put his calm to rout in a
  moment. He waited in timorous silence to hear what Heron
  might say next. Heron, however, nudged him expressively with
  his elbow and said:
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Heron</span>―You're a sly dog, Dedalus! </p>
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>―Why so? said Stephen. </p>
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Heron</span>―You'd think butter wouldn't melt in your mouth, said
  Heron. But I'm afraid you're a sly dog. </p>
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>―Might I ask you what you are talking about? said Stephen
  urbanely.</p>
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Heron</span>―Indeed  you might, answered Heron. We saw her, Wallis,
  didn't we? And deucedly pretty she is too. And so inquisitive!
  <span class="emph">And what part does Stephen take, Mr Dedalus? And will
  Stephen not sing, Mr Dedalus?</span> Your governor was staring at
  her through that eyeglass of his for all he was worth so that I
  think the old man has found you out too. I wouldn't care a bit,
  by Jove. She's  ripping, isn't she, Wallis? </p>
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Wallis</span>―Not half bad, answered Wallis quietly as he placed his
  holder once more in a corner of his mouth. </p></p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  A shaft of momentary anger flew through Stephen's mind at
  these indelicate allusions in the hearing of a stranger. For him
  there was nothing amusing in a girl's interest and regard. All
  day he had thought of nothing but their leavetaking on the
  steps of the tram at <span class="hide">53.324608, -6.281580</span>Harold's Cross, the stream of moody
  emotions it had made to course through him and the poem he
  had written about it. All day he had imagined a new meeting
  with her for he knew that she was to come to the play. The old
  restless moodiness had again filled his heart as it had done on
  the night of the party but had not found  an outlet in verse. The
  growth and knowledge of two years of boyhood stood between
  then and now, forbidding such an outlet: and all day the stream
  of gloomy tenderness within him had started forth and re-
  turned upon itself in dark courses and eddies, wearying him in
  the end until the pleasantry of the prefect and the painted little
  boy had drawn from him a movement of impatience.
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Heron</span>―So you may as well admit, Heron went on, that we've fairly
  found you out this time. You can't play the saint on me any
  more, that's one sure five. </p></p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  A soft peal of mirthless laughter escaped from his lips and,
  bending down as before, he struck Stephen lightly across the
  calf of the leg with his cane, as if in jesting reproof.</p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  Stephen's moment of anger had already passed. He was nei-
  ther flattered nor confused but simply wished the banter to
  end. He scarcely resented what had seemed to him at first a
  silly indelicateness for he knew that the adventure in his mind
  stood in no danger from their words: and his face mirrored his
  rival's false smile.
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Heron</span>―Admit! repeated Heron, striking him again with his cane
  across the calf of the leg. </p></p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  The stroke was playful but not so lightly given as the first
  one had been. Stephen felt the skin tingle and glow slightly and
  almost painlessly; and bowing submissively, as if to meet his
  companion's jesting mood, began to recite the Confiteor. The
  episode ended well for both Heron and Wallis laughed indul-
  gently at the irreverence.</p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  The confession came only from Stephen's lips and, while
  they spoke the words, a sudden memory had carried him to
  another scene called up, as if by magic, at the moment when he
  had noted the faint cruel dimples at the corners of Heron's
  smiling lips and had felt the familiar stroke of the cane against
  his calf and had heard the familiar word of admonition:
  <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Heron</span>―Admit!</p></p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  It was towards the close of his first term in the college when
  he was in number six. His sensitive nature was still smarting
  under the lashes of an undivined and squalid way of life. His
  soul was still disquieted and cast down by the dull phenom-
  enon of <span class="hide">53.349307, -6.263654</span>Dublin. He had emerged from a two years' spell of
  revery to find himself in the midst of a new scene, every event
  and figure of which affected him intimately, disheartened him
  or allured him and, whether alluring or disheartening, filled
  him always with unrest and bitter thoughts. All the leisure that
  his school life left him was passed in the company of subversive
  writers whose gibes and violence of speech set up a ferment in
  his brain before they passed out of it into his crude writings.</p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  The essay was for him the chief labour of his week and every
  Tuesday, as he marched from home to the school, he read his
  fate in the incidents of the way, pitting himself against some
  figure ahead of him and quickening his pace to outstrip it be-
  fore a certain goal was reached or planting his steps scrupu-
  lously in the spaces of the patchwork of the footpath and
  telling himself that he would be first and not first in the weekly
  essay.</p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  On a certain Tuesday the course of his triumphs was rudely
  broken. Mr Tate, the English master, pointed his finger at him
  and said bluntly:
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Tate</span>―This fellow has heresy in his essay. </p></p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  A hush fell on the class. Mr Tate did not break it but dug
  with his hand between his crossed thighs while his heavily
  starched linen creaked about his neck and wrists. Stephen did
  not look up. It was a raw spring morning and his eyes were still
  smarting and weak. He was conscious of failure and of detec-
  tion, of the squalor of his own mind and home, and felt against
  his neck the raw edge of his turned and jagged collar.</p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  A short loud laugh from Mr Tate set the class more at ease.
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Tate</span>―Perhaps you didn't know that, he said. </p>
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>―Where? asked Stephen. </p></p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  Mr Tate withdrew his delving hand and spread out the es-
  say.
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Tate</span>―Here. It's about the Creator and the soul. Rrm ... rrm .....
  rrm ...  Ah! <span class="emph">without a possibility of ever approaching nearer</span>.
  That's heresy. </p></p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  Stephen murmured:
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>―I meant <span class="emph">without a possibility of ever reaching</span>. </p></p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  It was a submission and Mr Tate, appeased, folded up the
  essay and passed it across to him, saying:
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Tate</span>―O ... Ah! <span class="emph">ever reaching</span>. That's another story. </p></p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  But the class was not so soon appeased. Though nobody
  spoke to him of the affair after class he could feel about him a
  vague general malignant joy.</p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  A few nights after this public chiding  he was walking with a
  letter along the Drumcondra Road when he heard a voice cry:
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Heron</span>―Halt! </p></p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  He turned and saw three boys of his own class coming to-
  wards him in the dusk. It was Heron who had called out and,
  as he marched forward between his two attendants, he cleft the
  air before him with a thin cane, in time to their steps. Boland,
  his friend, marched beside him, a large grin on his face, while
  Nash came on a few steps behind, blowing from the pace and
  wagging his great red head.</p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  As soon as the boys had turned into <span class="hide">53.362304, -6.249867</span>Clonliffe Roadtogether
  they began to speak about books and writers, saying what
  books they were reading and how many books there were in
  their fathers' bookcases at home. Stephen listened to them in
  some wonderment for Boland was the dunce and Nash the idler
  of the class. In fact after some talk about their favourite writers
  Nash declared for Captain Marryat who, he said, was the
  greatest writer.
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Heron</span>―Fudge! said Heron. Ask Dedalus. Who is the greatest writer,
  Dedalus?</p></p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  Stephen noted the mockery in the question and said:
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>―Of prose, do you mean? </p>
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Heron</span>―Yes.</p>
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>―Newman, I think. </p>
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Boland</span>―Is it Cardinal Newman? asked Boland. </p>
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>―Yes, answered Stephen. </p></p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  The grin broadened on Nash's freckled face as he turned to
  Stephen and said:
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Nash</span>―And do you like Cardinal Newman, Dedalus? </p>
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Heron</span>―O, many people say that Newman has the best prose style,
  Heron said to the other two in explanation. Of course, he's not
  a poet. </p>
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Boland</span>―And who is the best poet, Heron? asked Boland. </p>
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Heron</span>―Lord Tennyson, of course, answered Heron. </p>
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Nash</span>―O, yes, Lord Tennyson, said Nash. We have all his poetry at
  home in a book. </p></p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  At this Stephen forgot the silent vows he had been making
  and burst out:
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>―Tennyson a poet! Why, he's only a rhymester! </p>
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Heron</span>―O, get out! said Heron. Everyone knows that Tennyson is
  the greatest poet. </p>
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Boland</span>―And who do you think is the greatest poet? asked Boland,
  nudging his neighbour. </p>
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>―Byron, of course, answered Stephen. </p></p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  Heron gave the lead and all three joined in a scornful laugh.
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>―What are you laughing at? asked Stephen. </p>
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Heron</span>―You, said Heron. Byron the greatest poet! He's only a poet
  for uneducated people. </p>
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Boland</span>―He must be a fine poet! said Boland. </p>
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>―You may keep your mouth shut, said Stephen, turning on
  him boldly. All you know about poetry is what you wrote up
  on the slates in the yard and were going to be sent to the loft
  for.</p></p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  Boland, in fact, was said to have written on the slates in the
  yard a couplet about a classmate of his who often rode home
  from the college on a pony:</p>
  <p class="lg">
     As Tyson was riding into Jerusalem<br>
     He fell and hurt his Alec Kafoozelum.<br>
  </p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  This thrust put the two lieutenants to silence but Heron
  went on:
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Heron</span>―In any case Byron was a heretic and immoral too. </p>
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>―I don't care what he was, cried Stephen hotly. </p>
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Nash</span>―You don't care whether he was a heretic or not? said Nash. </p>
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>―What do you know about it? shouted Stephen. You never
  read a line of anything in your life except a trans or Boland
  either.</p>
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Boland</span>―I know that Byron was a bad man, said Boland. </p>
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Heron</span>―Here, Catch hold of this heretic, Heron called out. </p></p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  In a moment Stephen was a prisoner.
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Heron</span>―Tate made you buck up the other day, Heron went on, about
  the heresy in your essay. </p>
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Boland</span>―I'll tell him tomorrow, said Boland. </p>
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>―Will you? said Stephen. You'd be afraid to open your lips. </p>
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Boland</span>―Afraid?</p>
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>―Ay. Afraid of your life. </p>
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Heron</span>―Behave yourself! cried Heron, cutting at Stephen's legs with
  his cane. </p></p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  It was the signal for their  onset. Nash pinioned his arms
  behind while Boland seized a long cabbage stump which was
  lying in the gutter. Struggling and kicking under the cuts of the
  cane and the blows of the knotty stump Stephen was borne
  back against a barbed wire fence.
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Heron</span>―Admit that Byron was no good. </p>
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>―No.</p>
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Heron</span>―Admit.</p>
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>―No.</p>
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Heron</span>―Admit.</p>
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>―No. No. </p></p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  At last after a fury of plunges he wrenched himself free. His
  tormentors set off towards <span class="hide">53.360891, -6.251230</span>Jones's Road, laughing and jeering
  at him, while he, }omit{ half blinded with tears, stumbled on, clench-
  ing his fists madly and sobbing.</p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  While he was still repeating the Confiteor amid the indul-
  gent laughter of his hearers and while the scenes of that
  malignant episode were still passing sharply and swiftly before
  his mind he wondered why he bore no malice now to those
  who had tormented him. He had not forgotten a whit of their
  cowardice and cruelty but the memory of it called forth no
  anger from him. All the descriptions of fierce love and hatred
  which he had met in books had  seemed to him therefore unreal.
  Even that night as he stumbled homewards along <span class="hide">53.360891, -6.251230</span>Jones's Road
  he had felt that some power was divesting him of that sudden-
  woven anger as easily as a fruit is divested of her soft ripe peel.</p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  He remained standing with his two companions at the end
  of the shed, listening idly to their talk or to the bursts of
  applause in the theatre. She was sitting there among the others,
  perhaps waiting for him to appear. He tried to recall her ap-
  pearance but could not. He could remember only that she had
  worn a shawl about her head like a cowl and that her dark eyes
  had invited and unnerved him. He wondered had he been in her
  thoughts as she had been in his. Then in the dark and unseen
  by the other two he rested the tips of the fingers of one hand
  upon the palm of the other hand, scarcely touching it and yet
  pressing upon it lightly. But the pressure of her fingers had
  been lighter and steadier: and suddenly the memory of their
  touch traversed his brain and body like an invisible warm
  wave.</p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  A boy came towards them, running along under the shed.
  He was excited and breathless.
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">a boy</span>―O, Dedalus, he cried, Doyle is in a great bake about you.
  You're to go in at once and get dressed for the play. Hurry up,
  you better. </p>
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Heron</span>―He's coming now, said Heron to the messenger with a
  haughty drawl, when he wants to. </p></p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  The boy turned to Heron and repeated:
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">a boy</span>―But Doyle is in an awful bake. </p>
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Heron</span>―Will you tell Doyle with my best compliments that I damned
  his eyes? answered Heron. </p>
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>―Well, I must go now, said Stephen who cared little for such
  points of honour. </p>
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Heron</span>―I wouldn't, said Heron, damn me if I would. That's no way
  to send for one of the senior boys. In a bake, indeed! I think it's
  quite enough that you're taking a part in his bally old play. </p></p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  This spirit of quarrelsome comradeship which he had ob-
  served lately in his rival had not seduced Stephen from his
  habits of quiet obedience. He mistrusted the turbulence and
  doubted the sincerity of such comradeship which seemed to
  him a sorry anticipation of manhood. The question of honour
  here raised was, like all such questions, trivial to him. While his
  mind had been pursuing its intangible phantoms and turning in
  irresolution from such pursuit he had heard about him the
  constant voices of his father and of his masters, urging him to
  be a gentleman above all things and urging him to be a good
  catholic above all things. These voices had now come to be
  hollowsounding in his ears. When the gymnasium had been
  opened he had heard another voice urging him to be strong and
  manly and healthy and when the movement towards national
  revival had begun to be felt in the college yet another voice had
  bidden him  be true to his country and help to raise up her
  fallen language and tradition. In the profane world, as he
  foresaw, a worldly voice would bid him raise up his father's
  fallen state by his labours and, meanwhile, the voice of his
  schoolcomrades urged him to be a decent fellow, to shield
  others from blame or to beg them off and to do his best to get
  free days for the school. And it was the din of all these hollow-
  sounding voices that made him halt irresolutely in the pursuit
  of phantoms. He gave them ear only for a time but he was
  happy only when he was far from them, beyond their call,
  alone or in the company of phantasmal comrades.</p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  In the vestry a plump freshfaced jesuit and an elderly man, in
  shabby blue clothes, were dabbling in a case of paints and
  chalks. The boys who had been painted walked about or stood
  still awkwardly, touching their faces in a gingerly fashion with
  their furtive fingertips. In the middle of the vestry a young
  jesuit, who was then on a visit to the college, stood rocking
  himself rhythmically from the tips of his toes to his heels and
  back again, his hands thrust well forward into his sidepockets.
  His small head set off with glossy red curls and his newly
  shaven face agreed well with the spotless decency of his soutane
  and with his spotless shoes.</p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  As he watched this swaying form and tried to read for him-
  self the legend of the priest's mocking smile there came into
  Stephen's memory a saying which he had heard from his father
  before he had been sent to <span class="hide">53.310770, -6.684719</span>Clongowes, that you could always
  tell a jesuit by the style of his clothes. At the same moment he
  thought he saw a likeness between his father's mind and that of
  this smiling welldressed priest: and he was aware of some des-
  ecration of the priest's office or of the vestry itself, whose si-
  lence was now routed by loud talk and joking and its air
  pungent with the smells of the gasjets and the grease.</p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  While his forehead was being wrinkled and his jaws painted
  black and blue by the elderly man he listened distractedly to the
  voice of the plump young jesuit which bade him speak up and
  make his points clearly. He could hear the band playing <span class="emph">The
  Lily of Killarney</span> and knew that in a few moments the curtain
  would go up. He felt no stage fright but the thought of the part
  he had to play humiliated him. A remembrance  of some of his
  lines made a sudden flush rise to his painted cheeks. He saw her
  serious alluring eyes watching him from among the audience
  and their image at once swept away his scruples, leaving his
  will compact. Another nature seemed to have been lent him:
  the infection of the excitement and youth about him entered
  into and transformed his moody mistrustfulness. For one rare
  moment he seemed to be clothed in the real apparel of boy-
  hood: and, as he stood in the wings among the other players, he
  shared the common mirth amid which the drop scene was
  hauled upwards by two ablebodied priests with violent jerks
  and all awry.</p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  A few moments after he found himself on the stage amid the
  garish gas and the dim scenery, acting before the innumerable
  faces of the void. It surprised him to see that the play which he
  had known at rehearsals for a disjointed lifeless thing had
  suddenly assumed a life of its own. It seemed now to play itself,
  he and his fellow actors aiding it with their parts. When the
  curtain fell on the last scene he heard the void filled with
  applause and, through a rift in the side scene, saw the simple
  body before which he had acted magically deformed, the void
  of faces breaking at all points and falling asunder into busy
  groups.</p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  He left the stage quickly and rid himself of his mummery
  and passed out through the chapel into the college garden.
  Now that the play was over his nerves cried for some further
  adventure. He hurried onwards as if to overtake it. The doors
  of the theatre were all open and the audience had emptied out.
  On the lines which he had fancied the moorings of an ark a few
  lanterns swung in the night breeze, flickering cheerlessly. He
  mounted the steps from the garden in haste, eager that some
  prey should not elude him, and forced his way through the
  crowd in the hall and past the two jesuits who stood watching
  the exodus and bowing and shaking hands with the visitors. He
  pushed onward nervously, feigning a still greater haste and
  faintly conscious of the smiles and stares and nudges which his
  powdered head left in its wake.</p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  When he came out on the steps he saw his family waiting for
  him at the first lamp. In a glance he noted that every figure of
  the group was familiar and ran down the steps angrily.
   <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>―I have to leave a message down in George's Street, he said to
  his father quickly. I'll be home after you. </p></p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  Without waiting for his father's questions  he ran across the
  road and began to walk at breakneck speed down the hill. He
  hardly knew where he was walking. Pride and hope and desire
  like crushed herbs in his heart sent up vapours of maddening
  incense before the eyes of his mind. He strode down the hill
  amid the tumult of suddenrisen vapours of wounded pride and
  fallen hope and baffled desire. They streamed upwards before
  his anguished eyes in dense and maddening fumes and passed
  away above him till at last the air was clear and cold again.</p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  A film still veiled his eyes but they burned no longer. A
  power, akin to that which had often made anger or resentment
  fall from him, brought his steps to rest. He stood still and
  gazed up at the sombre porch of the morgue and from that to
  the dark cobbled laneway at its side. He saw the word <span class="emph">Lotts</span> on
  the wall of the lane and breathed slowly the rank heavy air.</p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  --That is horse piss and rotted straw, he thought. It is a good
  odour to breathe. It will calm my heart. My heart is quite calm
  now. I will go back.</p>
     
  <p class="textParagraph">  Stephen was once again seated beside his father in the corner
  of a railway carriage at Kingsbridge. He was travelling with his
  father by the night mail to Cork. As the train steamed out of
  the station he recalled his childish wonder of years before and
  every event of his first day at <span class="hide">53.310770, -6.684719</span>Clongowes. But he felt no wonder
  now. He saw the darkening lands slipping past him, the silent
  telegraphpoles passing his window swiftly every four seconds,
  the little glimmering stations, manned by a few silent sentries,
  flung by the mail behind her and twinkling for a moment in the
  darkness like fiery grains flung backwards by a runner.</p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  He listened without sympathy to his father's evocation of
  Cork and of scenes of his youth, a tale broken by sighs or
  draughts from his pocket flask whenever the image of some
  dead friend appeared in it or whenever the evoker remembered
  suddenly the purpose of his actual visit. Stephen heard but
  could feel no pity. The images of the dead were all strange to
  him save that of uncle Charles, an image which had lately been
  fading out of memory. He knew, however, that his father's
  property was going to be sold by auction and in the manner of
  his own dispossession he felt the world give the lie rudely to his
  phantasy.</p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  At Maryborough he fell asleep. When he awoke the train
  had passed out of Mallow and his father was stretched asleep
  on the other seat. The cold light of the dawn lay over the
  country, over the unpeopled fields and the closed cottages. The
  terror of sleep fascinated his mind as he watched the silent
  country or heard from time to time his father's deep breath or
  sudden sleepy movement. The neighbourhood of unseen
  sleepers filled him with strange dread as though they could
  harm him; and he prayed that the day might come quickly. His
  prayer, addressed neither to God nor saint, began with a shiver,
  as the chilly morning breeze crept through the chink of the
  carriage door to his feet, and ended in a trail of foolish words
  which he made to fit the insistent rhythm of the train: and
  silently, at intervals of four seconds, the telegraphpoles held the
  galloping notes of the music between punctual bars. This furi-
  ous music allayed his dread and, leaning against the window-
  ledge, he let his eyelids close again.</p>
  <p class="textParagraph">  They drove in a jingle across Cork while it was still early
  morning and Stephen finished his sleep in a bedroom of the
  Victoria Hotel. The bright warm sunlight was streaming
  through the window and he could hear the din of traffic. His
  father was standing before the dressingtable, examining his
  hair and face and moustache with great care, craning his neck
  across the waterjug and drawing it back sideways to see the
  better. While he did so he sang softly to himself with quaint
  accent and phrasing:
  <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>
    <p class="lg">
       'Tis youth and folly <br>
      Makes young men marry, <br>
      So here, my love, I'll <br>
      No longer stay.<br>
      What can't be cured, sure, <br>
      Must be injured, sure, <br>
      So I'll go to <br>
      Amerikay.<br>
      My love she's handsome, <br>
      My love she's boney: <br>
      She's like good whisky <br>
      When it is new;<br>
      But when 'tis old <br>
      And growing cold <br>
      It fades and dies like <br>
      The mountain dew.<br>
    </p>
  </p>
  </p>
    <p class="textParagraph">  The consciousness of the warm sunny city outside his win-
    dow and the tender tremors with which his father's voice
    festooned the strange sad happy air drove off all the mists of
    the night's ill humour from Stephen's brain. He got up quickly
    to dress and, when the song had ended, said:
     <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>―That's much prettier than any of your other <span class="emph">come-all-yous</span>. </p>
     <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―Do you think so? asked Mr Dedalus. </p>
     <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>―I like it, said Stephen. </p>
     <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―It's a pretty old air, said Mr Dedalus, twirling the points of
    his moustache. Ah, but you should have heard Mick Lacy sing
    it! Poor Mick Lacy! He had little turns for it, grace notes he
    used to put in that I haven't got. That was the boy }omit{ could sing a
    <span class="emph">come-all-you</span>, if you like. </p></p>
    <p class="textParagraph">  Mr Dedalus had ordered drisheens for breakfast and during
    the meal he crossexamined the waiter for local news. For the
    most part they spoke at cross purposes when a name was
    mentioned, the waiter having in mind its present holder and Mr
    Dedalus his father or perhaps his grandfather.
     <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―Well, I hope they haven't moved the Queen's College any-
    how, said Mr Dedalus, for I want to show it to this youngster
    of mine. </p></p>
    <p class="textParagraph">  Along the Mardyke the trees were in bloom. They entered
    the grounds of the college and were led by the garrulous porter
    across the quadrangle. But their progress across the gravel was
    brought to a halt after  every dozen or so paces by some reply of
    the porter's.
     <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―Ah, do you tell me so? And is poor Pottlebelly dead? </p>
     <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">porter</span>―Yes, sir. Dead, sir. </p></p>
    <p class="textParagraph">  During these halts Stephen stood awkwardly behind the two
    men, weary of the subject and waiting restlessly for the slow
    march to begin again. By the time they had crossed the quad-
    rangle his restlessness had risen to fever. He wondered how his
    father, whom he knew for a shrewd suspicious man, could be
    duped by the servile manners of the porter: and the lively
    southern speech which had entertained him all the morning
    now irritated his ears.</p>
    <p class="textParagraph">  They passed into the anatomy theatre where Mr Dedalus,
    the porter aiding him, searched the desks for his initials. Ste-
    phen remained in the background, depressed more than ever by
    the darkness and silence of the theatre and by the air it wore of
    jaded and formal study. On the desk before him he read the
    word <span class="emph">Foetus</span>  cut several times in the dark stained wood. The
    sudden legend startled his blood: he seemed to feel the absent
    students of the college about him and to shrink from their
    company. A vision of their life, which his father's words had
    been powerless to evoke, sprang up before him out of the word
    cut in the desk. A broadshouldered student with a moustache
    was cutting in the letters with a jackknife, seriously. Other
    students stood or sat near him laughing at his handiwork. One
    jogged his elbow. The big student turned on him, frowning. He
    was dressed in loose grey clothes and had tan boots.</p>
    <p class="textParagraph">  Stephen's name was called. He hurried down the steps of the
    theatre so as to be as far away from the vision as he could be
    and, peering closely at his father's initials, hid his flushed face.</p>
    <p class="textParagraph">  But the word and the vision capered before his eyes as he
    walked back across the quadrangle and towards the college
    gate. It shocked him to find in the outer world a trace of what
    he had deemed till then a brutish and individual malady of his
    own mind. His recent monstrous reveries came thronging into
    his memory. They too had sprung up before him, suddenly and
    furiously, out of mere words. He had soon given in to them and
    allowed them to sweep across and abase his intellect, wonder-
    ing always where they came from, from what den of monstrous
    images, and always weak and humble towards others, restless
    and sickened of himself when they had swept over him.
     <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―Ay, bedad! And there's the Groceries sure enough! cried Mr
    Dedalus. You often heard me speak of the Groceries, didn't
    you, Stephen. Many's the time we went down there when our
    names had been marked, a crowd of us, Harry Peard and little
    Jack Mountain and Bob Dyas and Maurice Moriarty, the
    Frenchman, and Tom O'Grady and Mick Lacy that I told you
    of this morning and Joey Corbet and poor little goodhearted
    Johnny Keevers of the Tantiles. </p></p>
    <p class="textParagraph">  The leaves of the trees along the Mardyke were astir and
    whispering in the sunlight. A team of cricketers passed, agile
    young men in flannels and blazers, one of them carrying the
    long green wicketbag. In a quiet bystreet a German band of five
    players in faded uniforms and with battered brass instruments
    was playing to an audience of street arabs and leisurely mess-
    enger boys. A maid in a white cap and apron was watering a
    box of plants on a sill which shone like a slab of limestone in
    the warm glare. From another window open to the air came the
    sound of a piano, scale after scale rising into the treble.</p>
    <p class="textParagraph">  Stephen walked on at his father's side, listening to stories he
    had heard before, hearing again the names of the scattered and
    dead revellers who had been the companions of his father's
    youth. And a faint sickness sighed in his heart. He recalled his
    own equivocal position in Belvedere, a free boy, a leader afraid
    of his own authority, proud and sensitive and suspicious, bat-
    tling against the squalor of his life and against the riot of his
    mind. The letters cut in the stained wood of the desk stared
    upon him, mocking his bodily weakness and futile enthusiasms
    and making him loathe himself for his own mad and filthy
    orgies. The spittle in his throat grew bitter and foul to swallow
    and the faint sickness climbed to his brain so that for a moment
    he closed his eyes and walked on in darkness.</p>
    <p class="textParagraph">  He could still hear his father's voice.
     <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―When you kick out for yourself, Stephen, }omit{ (as I daresay you
    will one of those days) }omit{ remember, whatever you do, to mix
    with gentlemen. When I was a young fellow I tell you I enjoyed
    myself. I mixed with fine decent fellows. Everyone of us could
    do something. One fellow had a good voice, another fellow
    was a good actor, another could sing a good comic song, an-
    other was a good oarsman or a good racketplayer, another
    could tell a good story and so on. We kept the ball rolling
    anyhow and enjoyed ourselves and saw a bit of life and we
    were none the worse of it either. But we were all gentlemen,
    Stephen, (at least I hope we were) }omit{ and bloody good honest
    Irishmen too. That's the kind of fellows I want you to associate
    with, fellows of the right kidney. I'm talking to you as a friend,
    Stephen. I don't believe in playing the stern father. I don't
    believe a son should be afraid of his father. No, I treat you as
    your grandfather treated me when I was a young chap. We
    were more like brothers than father and son. I'll never forget
    the first day he caught me smoking. I was standing at the end
    of the South Terrace one day with some maneens like myself
    and sure we thought we were grand fellows because we had
    pipes stuck in the corners of our mouths. Suddenly the gov-
    ernor passed. He didn't say a word or stop even. But the next
    day, Sunday, we were out for a walk together and when we
    were coming home he took out his cigar case and said: <span class="emph">By the
    bye, Simon, I didn't know you smoked:</span> or something like that.
    – Of course I tried to carry it off as best I could. <span class="emph">If you want a
    good smoke</span>, he said, <span class="emph">try one of these cigars. An American
    captain made me a present of them last night in Queenstown</span>. </p></p>
    <p class="textParagraph">  Stephen heard his father's voice break into a laugh which
    was almost a sob.
     <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―He was the handsomest man in Cork at that time, by God he
    was! The women used to stand to look after him in the street. </p></p>
    <p class="textParagraph">  He heard the sob passing loudly down his father's throat
    and opened his eyes with a nervous impulse. The sunlight
    breaking suddenly on his sight turned the sky and clouds into a
    fantastic world of sombre masses with lakelike spaces of dark
    rosy light. His very brain was sick and powerless. He could
    scarcely interpret the letters of the signboards of the shops. By
    his monstrous way of life he seemed to have put himself be-
    yond the limits of reality. Nothing moved him or spoke to him
    from the real world unless he heard in it an echo of the
    infuriated cries within him. He could respond to no earthly or
    human appeal, dumb and insensible to the call of summer and
    gladness and companionship, wearied and dejected by his fa-
    ther's voice. He could scarcely recognise as his his own
    thoughts, and repeated slowly to himself:</p>
    <p class="textParagraph">  --I am Stephen Dedalus. I am walking beside my father whose
    name is Simon Dedalus. We are in Cork, in Ireland. Cork is a
    city. Our room is in the Victoria Hotel. Victoria and Stephen
    and Simon. Simon and Stephen and Victoria. Names.</p>
    <p class="textParagraph">  The memory of his childhood suddenly grew dim. He tried
    to call forth some of its vivid moments but could not. He
    recalled only names: Dante, Parnell, Clane, <span class="hide">53.310770, -6.684719</span>Clongowes. A little
    boy had been taught geography by an old woman who kept
    two brushes in her wardrobe. Then he had been sent away
    from home to a college. In the college he had made his first
    communion and eaten slim jim out of his cricket cap and
    watched the firelight leaping and dancing on the wall of a little
    bedroom in the infirmary and dreamed of being dead, of mass
    being said for him by the rector in a black and gold cope, of
    being buried then in the little graveyard of the community off
    the main avenue of limes. But he had not died then. Parnell had
    died. There had been no mass for the dead in the chapel and no
    procession. He had not died but he had faded out like a film in
    the sun. He had been lost or had wandered out of existence for
    he no longer existed. How strange to think of him passing out
    of existence in such a way, not by death but by fading out in
    the sun or by being lost and forgotten somewhere in the uni-
    verse! It was strange to see his small body appear again for a
    moment: a little boy in a grey belted suit. His hands were in his
    sidepockets and his trousers were tucked in at the  knees by
    elastic bands.</p>
    <p class="textParagraph">  On the evening of the day on which the property was sold
    Stephen followed his father meekly about the city from bar to
    bar. To the sellers in the market, to the barmen and barmaids,
    to the beggars who importuned him for a lob Mr Dedalus told
    the same tale, that he was an old Corkonian, that he had been
    trying for thirty years to get rid of his Cork accent up in Dublin
    and that Peter Pickackafox beside him was his eldest son but
    that he was only a Dublin jackeen.</p>
    <p class="textParagraph">  They had set out early in the morning from Newcombe's
    coffeehouse where Mr Dedalus' cup had rattled noisily against
    its saucer and Stephen had tried to cover that shameful sign of
    his father's drinkingbout of the night before by moving his
    chair and coughing. One humiliation had succeeded another:
    the false smiles of the market sellers, the curvettings and
    oglings of the barmaids with whom his father flirted, the com-
    pliments and encouraging words of his father's friends. They
    had told him that he had a great look of his grandfather and
    Mr Dedalus had agreed that he was an ugly likeness. They had
    unearthed traces of a Cork accent in his speech and made him
    admit that the Lee was a much finer river than the Liffey. One
    of them in order to put his Latin to the proof had made him
    translate short passages from Dilectus and asked him whether
    it was correct to say: Tempora mutantur nos et mutamur in illis
    or Tempora mutantur et nos mutamur in illis. Another, a brisk
    old man, whom Mr Dedalus called Johnny Cashman, had
    covered him with confusion by asking him to say which were
    prettier, the Dublin girls or the Cork girls.
     <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―He's not that way built, said Mr Dedalus. Leave him alone.
    He's a levelheaded thinking boy who doesn't bother his head
    about that kind of nonsense. </p>
     <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">little old man</span>―Then he's not his father's son, said the little old man. </p>
     <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―I don't know, I'm sure, said Mr Dedalus, smiling com-
    placently.</p>
     <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">little old man</span>―Your father, said the little old man to Stephen, was the
    boldest flirt in the city of Cork in his day. Do you know that? </p></p>
    <p class="textParagraph">  Stephen looked down and studied the tiled floor of the bar
    into which they had drifted.
     <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―Now don't be putting ideas into his head, said Mr Dedalus.
    Leave him to his Maker. </p>
     <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">little old man</span>―Yerra, sure I wouldn't put any ideas into his head. I'm old
    enough to be his grandfather. And I am a grandfather, said the
    little old man to Stephen. Do you know that? </p>
     <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>―Are you? asked Stephen. </p>
     <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">little old man</span>―Bedad I am, said the little old man. I have two bouncing
    grandchildren out at Sunday's Well. Now then! What age do
    you think I am? And I remember seeing your grandfather in his
    red coat riding out to hounds. That was before you were born. </p>
     <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―Ay, or thought of, said Mr Dedalus. </p>
     <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">little old man</span>―Bedad I did! repeated the little old man. And, more than
    that, I can remember even your greatgrandfather, old John Ste-
    phen Dedalus, and a fierce old fireeater he was. Now then!
    There's a memory for you! </p>
     <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">another of the company</span>―That's three generations - four generations, said another of
    the company. Why, Johnny Cashman, you must be nearing the
    century.</p>
     <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">little old man</span>―Well, I'll tell you the truth, said the little old man. I'm just
    twentyseven years of age. </p>
     <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―We're as old as we feel, Johnny, said Mr Dedalus. And just
    finish what you have there and we'll have another. Here, Tim
    or Tom or whatever your name is, give us the same again here.
    By God, I don't feel more than eighteen myself. There's that
    son of mine there not half my age and I'm a better man than he
    is any day of the week. </p>
     <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">another of the company</span>―Draw it mild now, Dedalus. I think it's about time for you to
    take a back seat, said the gentleman who had spoken before. </p>
     <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―No, by God! asserted Mr Dedalus. I'll sing a tenor song
    against him or I'll vault a fivebarred gate against him or I'll run
    with him after the hounds across the country as I did thirty
    years ago along with the Kerry Boy and the best man for it. </p>
     <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">little old man</span>―But he'll beat you here, said the little old man, tapping his
    forehead and raising his glass to drain it. </p>
     <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―Well, I hope he'll be as good a man as his father. That's all I
    can say, said Mr Dedalus. </p>
     <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">little old man</span>―If he is, he'll do, said the little old man. </p>
     <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―And thanks be to God, Johnny, said Mr Dedalus, that we
    lived so long and did so little harm. </p>
     <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">little old man</span>―But did so much good, Simon, said the little old man
    gravely. Thanks be to God we lived so long and did so much
    good.</p></p>
    <p class="textParagraph">  Stephen watched the three glasses being raised from the
    counter as his father and his two cronies drank to the memory
    of their past. An abyss of fortune or of temperament sundered
    him from them. His mind seemed older than theirs: it shone
    coldly on their strifes and happiness and regrets like a moon
    upon a younger earth. No life or youth stirred in him as it had
    stirred in them. He had known neither the pleasure of compan-
    ionship with others nor the vigour of rude male health nor filial
    piety. Nothing stirred within his soul but a cold and cruel and
    loveless lust. His childhood was dead or lost and with it his
    soul capable of simple joys: and he was drifting amid life like
    the barren shell of the moon.</p>
    <p class="lg">
       Art thou pale for weariness <br>
       Of climbing heaven and gazing on the earth <br>
       Wandering companionless ....?<br>
    </p>
    <p class="textParagraph">  He repeated to himself the lines of Shelley's fragment. Its
    alternation of sad human ineffectiveness with vast inhuman
    cycles of activity chilled him: and he forgot his own human and
    ineffectual grieving.</p>
    
   
  
    <p class="textParagraph">  Stephen's mother and his brother and one of his cousins
    waited at the corner of quiet Foster Place while he and his
    father went up the steps and along the colonnade where the
    highland sentry was parading. When they had passed into the
    great hall and stood at the counter Stephen drew forth his
    orders on the governor of the bank of Ireland for thirty and
    three pounds; and these sums, the moneys of his exhibition and
    essay prize, were paid over to him rapidly by the teller in notes
    and in coin respectively. He bestowed them in his pockets with
    feigned composure and suffered the friendly teller, to whom his
    father chatted, to take his hand across the broad counter and
    wish him a brilliant career in after life. He was impatient of
    their voices and could not keep his feet at rest. But the teller
    still deferred the serving of others to say that he was living in
    changed times and that there was nothing like giving a boy the
    best education that money could buy. Mr Dedalus lingered in
    the hall gazing about him and up at the roof and telling Ste-
    phen, who urged him to come out, that they were standing in
    the house of commons of the old Irish parliament.
     <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―God help us! he said piously. To think of the men of those
    times, Stephen, Hely Hutchinson and Flood and Henry Grattan
    and Charles Kendal Bushe, and the noblemen we have now,
    leaders of the Irish people at home and abroad. Why, by God,
    they wouldn't be seen dead in a ten acre field with them. No,
    Stephen, old chap, I'm sorry to say that they are only as I roved
    out one fine May morning in the merry month of sweet July. </p></p>
    <p class="textParagraph">  A keen October wind was blowing round the bank. The
    three figures standing at the edge of the muddy path had
    pinched cheeks and watery eyes. Stephen looked at his thinly
    clad mother and remembered that a few days before he had
    seen a mantle priced at twenty guineas in the window of Bar-
    nardo's.
     <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―Well that's done, said Mr Dedalus. </p>
     <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>―We had better go to dinner, said Stephen. Where? </p>
     <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―Dinner? said Mr Dedalus. Well, I suppose we had better,
    what?</p>
     <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mary Dedalus</span>―Some place that's not too dear, said Mrs Dedalus. </p>
     <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―Underdone's?</p>
     <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mary Dedalus</span>―Yes. Some quiet place. </p>
     <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>―Come along, said Stephen quickly. It doesn't matter about
    the dearness. </p></p>
    <p class="textParagraph">  He walked on before them with short nervous steps, smiling.
    They tried to keep up with him, smiling also at his eagerness.
     <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―Take it easy like a good young fellow, said his father. We're
    not out for the half mile, are we? </p></p>
    <p class="textParagraph">  For a swift season of merrymaking the money of his prizes
    ran through Stephen's  fingers. Great parcels of groceries and
    delicacies and dried fruits arrived from the city. Every day he
    drew up a bill of fare for the family and every night led a party
    of three or four to the theatre to see <span class="emph">Ingomar</span> or <span class="emph">The Lady of
    Lyons</span>. In his coat pockets he carried squares of Vienna choc-
    olate for his guests while his trousers' pockets bulged with
    masses of silver and copper coins. He bought presents for
    everyone, overhauled his room, wrote out resolutions, marshal-
    led his books up and down their shelves, pored upon all kinds
    of price lists, drew up a form of commonwealth for the
    household by which every member of it held some office,
    opened a loan bank for his family and pressed loans on willing
    borrowers so that he might have the pleasure of making out
    receipts and reckoning the interests on the sums lent. When he
    could do no more he drove up and down the city in trams.
    Then the season of pleasure came to an end. The pot of pink
    enamel paint gave out and the wainscot of his bedroom re-
    mained with its unfinished and illplastered coat.</p>
    <p class="textParagraph">  His household returned to its usual way of life. His mother
    had no further occasion to upbraid him for squandering his
    money. He too returned to his old life at school and all his
    novel enterprises fell to pieces. The commonwealth fell, the
    loan bank closed its coffers and its books on a sensible loss, the
    rules of life which he had drawn about himself fell into desue-
    tude.</p>
    <p class="textParagraph">  How foolish his aim had been! He had tried to build a
    breakwater of order and elegance against the sordid tide of life
    without him and to dam up, by rules of conduct and active
    interests and new filial relations, the powerful recurrence of the
    tides within him. Useless. From without as from within the
    waters had flowed over his barriers: their tides began once
    more to jostle fiercely above the crumbled mole.</p>
    <p class="textParagraph">  He saw clearly too his own futile isolation. He had not gone
    one step nearer the lives he had sought to approach nor bridged
    the restless shame and rancour that divided him from father
    and mother and brother and sister. He felt that he was hardly
    of the one blood with them but stood to them rather in the
    mystical kinship of fosterage, fosterchild and fosterbrother.</p>
    <p class="textParagraph">  He burned to appease the fierce longings of his heart before
    which everything else was idle and alien. He cared little that he
    was in mortal sin, that his life had grown to be a tissue of
    subterfuges and falsehood. Beside the savage desire within him
    to realise the enormities which he brooded on nothing was
    sacred. He bore cynically with the shameful details of his secret
    riots in which he exulted to defile with patience whatever im-
    age had attracted his eyes. By day and by night he moved
    among distorted images of the outer world. A figure that had
    seemed to him by day demure and innocent  came towards him
    by night through the winding darkness of sleep, her face trans-
    figured by a lecherous cunning, her eyes bright with brutish
    joy. Only the morning pained him with its dim memory of dark
    orgiastic riot, its keen and humiliating sense of transgression.</p>
    <p class="textParagraph">  He returned to his wanderings. The veiled autumnal even-
    ings led him from street to street as they had led him years
    before along the quiet avenues of Blackrock. But no vision of
    trim front gardens or of kindly lights in the windows poured a
    tender influence upon him now. Only at times, in the pauses of
    his desire, when the luxury that was wasting him gave room to
    a softer languor, the image of Mercedes traversed the back-
    ground of his memory. He saw again the small white house and
    the garden of rosebushes on the road that led to the mountains
    and he remembered the sadly proud gesture of refusal which he
    was to make there, standing with her in the moonlit garden
    after years of estrangement and adventure. At those moments
    the soft speeches of Claude Melnotte rose to his lips and eased
    his unrest. A tender premonition touched him of the tryst he
    had then looked forward to and, in spite of the horrible reality
    which lay between his hope of then and now, of the holy
    encounter he had then imagined at which weakness and timid-
    ity and inexperience were to fall from him.</p>
    <p class="textParagraph">  Such moments passed and the wasting fires of lust sprang up
    again. The verses passed from his lips and the inarticulate cries
    and the unspoken brutal words rushed forth from his brain to
    force a passage. His blood was in revolt. He wandered up and
    down the dark slimy streets peering into the gloom of lanes and
    doorways, listening eagerly for any sound. He moaned to him-
    self like some baffled prowling beast. He wanted to sin with
    another of his kind, to force another being to sin with him and
    to exult with her in sin. He felt some dark presence moving
    irresistibly upon him from the  darkness, a presence subtle and
    murmurous as a flood filling him wholly with itself. Its mur-
    mur besieged his ears like the murmur of some multitude in
    sleep; its subtle streams penetrated his being. His hands
    clenched convulsively and his teeth set together as he suffered
    the agony of its penetration. He stretched out his arms in the
    street to hold fast the frail swooning form that eluded him and
    incited him: and the cry that he had strangled for so long in his
    throat issued from his lips. It broke from him like a wail of
    despair from a hell of sufferers and died in a wail of furious
    entreaty, a cry for an iniquitous abandonment, a cry which was
    but the echo of an obscene scrawl which he had read on the
    oozing wall of a urinal.</p>
    <p class="textParagraph">  He had wandered into a maze of narrow and dirty streets.
    From the foul laneways he heard bursts of hoarse riot and
    wrangling and the drawling of drunken singers. He walked
    onward, undismayed, wondering whether he had strayed into
    the quarter of the jews. Women and girls dressed in long vivid
    gowns traversed the street from house to house. They were
    leisurely and perfumed. A trembling seized him and his eyes
    grew dim. The yellow gasflames arose before his troubled vi-
    sion against the vapoury sky, burning as if before an altar.
    Before the doors and in the lighted halls groups were gathered,
    arrayed as for some rite. He was in another world: he had
    awakened from a slumber of centuries.</p>
    <p class="textParagraph">  He stood still in the middle of the roadway, his heart clam-
    ouring against his bosom in a tumult. A young woman dressed
    in a long pink gown laid her hand on his arm to detain him and
    gazed into his face. She said gaily:
     <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">prostitute</span>―Good night, Willie dear! </p></p>
    <p class="textParagraph">  Her room was warm and lightsome. A huge doll sat with her
    legs apart in the copious easychair beside the bed. He tried to
    bid his tongue speak that he might seem at ease, watching her
    as she undid her gown, noting the proud conscious movements
    of her perfumed head.</p>
    <p class="textParagraph">  As he stood silent in the middle of the room she came over
    to him and embraced him gaily and gravely. Her round arms
    held him firmly to her and he, seeing her face lifted to him in
    serious calm and feeling the warm calm rise and fall of her
    breast, all but burst into hysterical weeping. Tears of joy and
    relief shone in his delighted eyes and his lips parted though they
    would not speak.</p>
    <p class="textParagraph">  She passed her tinkling hand through his hair, calling him a
    little rascal.
     <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">prostitute</span>―Give me a kiss, she said. </p></p>
    <p class="textParagraph">  His lips would not bend to kiss her. He wanted to be held
    firmly in her arms, to be caressed slowly, slowly, slowly. In her
    arms he felt that he had suddenly become strong and fearless
    and sure of himself. But his lips would not bend to kiss her.</p>
    <p class="textParagraph">  With a sudden movement she bowed his head and joined her
    lips to his and he read the meaning of her movements in her
    frank uplifted eyes. It was too much for him. He closed his
    eyes, surrendering himself to her, body and mind, conscious of
    nothing in the world but the dark pressure of her softly parting
    lips. They pressed upon his brain as upon his lips as though
    they were the vehicle of a vague speech; and between them he
    felt an unknown and timid pressure, darker than the swoon of
    sin, softer than sound or odour.</p>
  



  
    <h2 class="heading">III<br>
</h2>
    <p class="textParagraph"> The swift December dusk had come tumbling clownishly after
    its dull day and as he stared through the dull square of the
    window of the schoolroom he felt his belly crave for its food.
    He hoped there would be stew for dinner, turnips and carrots
    and bruised potatoes and fat mutton pieces to be ladled out in
    thick peppered flourfattened sauce. Stuff it into you, his belly
    counselled him.</p>
    <p class="textParagraph"> It would be a gloomy secret night. After early nightfall the
    yellow lamps would light up here and there the squalid quarter
    of the brothels. He would follow a devious course up and down
    the streets, circling always nearer and nearer in a tremor of fear
    and joy, until his feet led him suddenly round a dark corner.
    The whores would be just coming out of their houses making
    ready for the night, yawning lazily after their sleep and settling
    the hairpins in their clusters of hair. He would pass by them
    calmly waiting for a sudden movement of his own will or a
    sudden call to his sinloving soul from their soft perfumed flesh.
    Yet as he prowled in quest of that call his senses, stultified only
    by his desire, would note keenly all that wounded and shamed
    them, his eyes a ring of porter froth on a clothless table or a
    photograph of two soldiers standing to attention or a gaudy
    playbill, his ears the drawling jargon of greeting:
     <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">a whore</span>―Hello, Bertie, any good in your mind?</p>
     <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">a whore</span>―Is that you, pigeon?</p>
     <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">a whore</span>―Number ten. Fresh Nelly is waiting on you.</p>
     <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">a whore</span>―Goodnight, husband! Coming in to have a short time?</p></p>
    <p class="textParagraph"> The equation on the page of his scribbler began to spread
    out a widening tail, eyed and starred like a peacock's: and
    when the eyes and stars of its indices had been eliminated be-
    gan slowly to fold itself together again. The indices appearing
    and disappearing were eyes opening and closing; the eyes
    opening and closing were stars being born and being quenched.
    The vast cycle of starry life bore his weary  mind outward to its
    verge and inward to its centre, a distant music accompanying
    him outward and inward. What music? The music came nearer
    and he recalled the words, the words of Shelley's fragment
    upon the moon wandering companionless, pale for weariness.
    The stars began to crumble and a cloud of fine stardust fell
    through space.</p>
    <p class="textParagraph"> The dull light fell more faintly upon the page whereon an-
    other equation began to unfold itself slowly and to spread
    abroad its widening tail. It was his own soul going forth to
    experience, unfolding itself sin by sin, spreading abroad the
    balefire of its burning stars and folding back upon itself, fading
    slowly, quenching its own lights and fires. They were
    quenched: and the cold darkness filled chaos.</p>
    <p class="textParagraph"> A cold lucid indifference reigned in his soul. At his first
    violent sin he had felt a wave of vitality pass out of him and
    had feared to find his body or his soul maimed by the excess.
    Instead the vital wave had carried him on its bosom out of
    himself and back again when it receded: and no part of body or
    soul had been maimed but a dark peace had been established
    between them. The chaos in which his ardour extinguished
    itself was a cold indifferent knowledge of himself. He had
    sinned mortally not once but many times and he knew that,
    while he stood in danger of eternal damnation for the first sin
    alone, by every succeeding sin he multiplied his guilt and his
    punishment. His days and works and thoughts could make no
    atonement for him, the fountains of sanctifying grace having
    ceased to refresh his soul. At most by an alms given to a
    beggar, whose blessing he fled from, he might hope wearily to
    win for himself some measure of actual grace. Devotion had
    gone by the board. What did it avail to pray when he knew that
    his soul lusted after its own destruction? A certain pride, a
    certain awe, withheld him from offering to God even one
    prayer at night though he knew it was in God's power to take
    away his life while he slept and hurl his soul hellward ere he
    could beg for mercy. His pride in his own sin, his loveless awe
    of God told him that his offence was too grievous to be atoned
    for in whole or in part by a false homage to the Allseeing and
    Allknowing. <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">a voice</span>―Well now, Ennis, I declare you have a head and so has my
    stick! Do you mean to say that you are not able to tell me what
    a surd is?</p></p>
    <p class="textParagraph"> The blundering answer stirred the embers of his contempt of
    his fellows. Towards others he felt neither shame nor fear. On
    Sunday mornings as he passed the churchdoor he glanced
    coldly at the worshippers who stood bareheaded, four deep,
    outside the church, morally present at the mass which they
    could neither see nor hear. Their dull piety and the sickly smell
    of the cheap hairoil with which they had anointed their heads
    repelled him from the altar they prayed at. He stooped to the
    evil of hypocrisy with others, sceptical of their innocence which
    he could cajole so easily.</p>
    <p class="textParagraph"> On the wall of his bedroom hung an illuminated scroll, the
    certificate of his prefecture in the college of the sodality of the
    Blessed Virgin Mary. On Saturday mornings when the sodality
    met in the chapel to recite the little office his place was a
    cushioned kneelingdesk at the right of the altar from which he
    led his wing of boys through the responses. The falsehood of
    his position did not pain him. If at moments he felt an impulse
    to rise from his post of honour and, confessing before them all
    his unworthiness, to leave the chapel, a glance at their faces
    restrained him. The imagery of the psalms of prophecy soothed
    his barren pride. The glories of Mary held his soul captive:
    spikenard and myrrh and frankincense, symbolising the
    preciousness of God's gifts to her soul, rich garments, symbol-
    ising her royal lineage, her emblems, the lateflowering plant
    and lateblossoming tree, symbolising the agelong gradual
    growth of her cultus among men. When it fell to him to read
    the lesson towards the close of the office he read it in a veiled
    voice, lulling his conscience to its music:</p>
    <p class="lg">
      <p class="textParagraph"> <span class="emph">Quasi cedrus exaltata sum in Libanon et quasi cu-
      pressus in  monte Sion. Quasi palma exaltata sum in
      Gades et quasi  plantatio rosae in Jericho. Quasi uliva
      speciosa in campis et  quasi platanus exaltata sum juxta
      aquam in plateis. Sicut  cinnamomum et balsamum aro-
      matizans odorem dedi et quasi  myrrha electa dedi
      suavitatem odoris.</span></p>
    </p>
    <p class="textParagraph"> His sin, which had covered him from the sight of God, had
    led him nearer to the refuge of sinners. Her eyes seemed to
    regard him with mild pity; her holiness, a strange light glowing
    faintly upon her frail flesh, did not humiliate the sinner who
    approached her. If ever he was impelled to cast sin from him
    and to repent the impulse that moved him was the wish to be
    her knight. If ever his soul, reentering her dwelling shyly after
    the frenzy of his body's lust had spent itself, was turned to-
    wards her whose emblem is the morning star, <span class="emph">bright and</span>
    <span class="emph">musical, telling of heaven and infusing peace</span>, it was when her
    names were murmured softly by lips whereon there still lin-
    gered foul and shameful words, the savour itself of a lewd kiss.</p>
    <p class="textParagraph"> That was strange. He tried to think how it could be but the
    dusk, deepening in the schoolroom, covered over his thought.
    The bell rang. The master marked the sums and cuts to be done
    for the next lesson and went out. Heron, beside Stephen, began
    to hum tunelessly:</p>
    <p class="textParagraph"> <span class="emph">My excellent friend Bombados.</span>
    <p class="textParagraph"> Ennis, who had gone to the yard, came back, saying:
     <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Ennis</span>―The boy from the house is coming up for the rector.</p></p>
    A tall boy behind Stephen rubbed his hands and said:
     <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">a tall boy</span>―That's game ball. We can scut the whole hour. He won't be
    in till after half two. Then you can ask him questions on the
    catechism, Dedalus.</p></p>
    <p class="textParagraph"> Stephen, leaning back and drawing idly on his scribbler,
    listened to the talk about him which Heron checked from time
    to time by saying:
     <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Vincent Heron</span>―Shut up, will you. Don't make such a bally racket!</p></p>
    <p class="textParagraph">It was strange too that he found an arid pleasure in follow-
    ing up to the end the rigid lines of the doctrines of the church
    and penetrating into obscure silences  only to hear and feel the
    more deeply his own condemnation. The sentence of saint
    James which says that he who offends against one command-
    ment becomes guilty of all had seemed to him first a swollen
    phrase until he had begun to grope in the darkness of his own
    state. From the evil seed of lust all other deadly sins had sprung
    forth: pride in himself and contempt of others, covetousness in
    using money for the purchase of unlawful pleasure, envy of
    those whose vices he could not reach to and calumnious
    murmuring against the pious, gluttonous  enjoyment of food,
    the dull glowering anger amid which he brooded upon his
    longing, the swamp of spiritual and bodily sloth in which his
    whole being had sunk.</p>
    <p class="textParagraph"> As he sat in his bench gazing calmly at the rector's shrewd
    harsh face his mind wound itself in and out of the curious
    questions proposed to it. If a man had stolen a pound in his
    youth and had used that pound to amass a huge fortune how
    much was he obliged to give back, the pound he had stolen
    only or the pound together with the compound interest accru-
    ing upon it or all his huge fortune? If a layman in giving
    baptism pour the water before saying the words is the child
    baptised? Is baptism with a mineral water valid? How comes it
    that while the first beatitude promises the kingdom of heaven
    to the poor of heart the second beatitude promises also to the
    meek that they shall possess the land? Why was the sacrament
    of the eucharist instituted under the two species of bread and
    wine if Jesus Christ be present body and blood, soul and divin-
    ity, in the bread alone and in the wine alone? Does a tiny
    particle of the consecrated bread contain all the body and
    blood of Jesus Christ or a part only of the body and blood? If
    the wine change into vinegar and the host crumble  into cor-
    ruption after they have been consecrated is Jesus Christ still
    present under their species as God and as man?
     <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">a boy</span>―Here he is! Here he is!</p></p>
    <p class="textParagraph"> A boy from his post at the window had seen the rector come
    from the house. All the catechisms were opened and all heads
    bent upon them silently. The rector entered and took his seat
    on the dais. A gentle kick from the tall boy in the bench behind
    urged Stephen to ask a difficult question.</p>
    <p class="textParagraph"> The rector did not ask for a catechism to hear the lesson
    from. He clasped his hands on the desk and said:
     <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Conmee</span>―The retreat will begin on Wednesday afternoon in honour of
    saint Francis Xavier whose feast day is Saturday. The retreat
    will go on from Wednesday to Friday. On Friday confessions
    will be heard all the afternoon after beads. If any boys have
    special confessors perhaps it will be better for them not to
    change. Mass will be on Saturday morning at nine o'clock and
    general communion for the whole college. Saturday will be a
    free day. Sunday of course. But Saturday and Sunday being free
    days some boys might be inclined to think that Monday is a
    free day also. Beware of making that mistake. I think you,
    Lawless, are likely to make that mistake.</p>
     <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Lawless</span>―I, sir? Why,  sir?</p></p>
    <p class="textParagraph"> A little wave of quiet mirth broke forth over the class of
    boys from the rector's grim smile. Stephen's heart began slowly
    to fold and fade with fear like a withering flower.</p>
    <p class="textParagraph"> The rector went on gravely:
     <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Conmee</span>―You are all familiar with the story of the life of saint Francis
    Xavier, I suppose, the patron of your college. He came of an
    old and illustrious Spanish family and you remember that he
    was one of the first followers of saint Ignatius. They met in <span class="hide">48.853157 2.343094</span>
    Paris where Francis Xavier was professor of philosophy at the
    university. This young and brilliant nobleman and man of let-
    ters entered heart and soul into the ideas of our glorious
    founder and you know that he, at his own desire, was sent by
    saint Ignatius to preach to the Indians. He is called, as you
    know, the apostle of the Indies. He went from country to
    country in the east, from Africa to India, from India to Japan,
    baptising the people. He is said to have baptised as many as ten
    thousand idolaters in one month. It is said that his right arm
    had grown powerless from having been raised so often over the
    heads of those whom he baptised. He wished then to go to
    China to win still more souls for God but he died of fever on
    the <span class="hide">21.705010 112.791206</span>island of Sancian. A great saint, saint Francis Xavier! A
    great soldier of God!</p></p>
    <p class="textParagraph"> The rector paused and then, shaking his clasped hands be-
    fore him, went on:
     <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Conmee</span>―He had the faith in him that moves mountains. Ten thou-
    sand souls won for God in a single month! That is a true
    conqueror, true to the motto of our order ad majorem Dei
    gloriam! A saint who has great power in heaven, remember:
    power to intercede for us in our grief, power to obtain what-
    ever we pray for if it be for the good of our souls, power above
    all to obtain for us the grace to repent if we be in sin. A great
    saint, saint Francis Xavier! A great fisher of souls!</p></p>
    <p class="textParagraph"> He ceased to shake his clasped hands and, resting them
    against his forehead, looked right and left of them keenly at his
    listeners out of his dark stern eyes.</p>
    <p class="textParagraph"> In the silence their dark fire kindled the dusk into a tawny
    glow. Stephen's heart had withered up like a flower of the
    desert that feels the simoom  coming from afar.</p>
     
     
      <p class="textParagraph"> <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Arnall</span>―<span class="emph">Remember only thy last things and thou shalt not sin for</span>
      <span class="emph">ever</span> – words taken, my dear little brothers in Christ, from the
      book of Ecclesiastes, seventh chapter, fortieth verse. In the
      name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.
      Amen.</p></p>
      <p class="textParagraph"> Stephen sat in the front bench of the chapel. Father Arnall
      sat at a table to the left of the altar. He wore about his shoul-
      ders a heavy cloak; his pale face was drawn and his voice
      broken with rheum. The figure of his old master, so strangely
      rearisen, brought back to Stephen's mind his life at <span class="hide">53.310624 -6.684096</span>Clongowes:
      the wide playgrounds, swarming with boys, the square ditch,
      the little cemetery off the main avenue of limes where he had
      dreamed of being buried, the firelight on the wall of the infirm-
      ary where he lay sick, the sorrowful face of Brother Michael.
      His soul, as these memories came back to him, became again a
      child's soul.
       <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Arnall</span>―We are assembled here today, my dear little brothers in
      Christ, for one brief moment far away from the busy bustle of
      the outer world to celebrate and to honour one of the greatest
      of saints, the apostle of the Indies, the patron saint also of your
      college, saint Francis Xavier. Year after year for much longer
      than any of you, my dear little boys, can remember or than I
      can remember the boys of this college have met in this very
      chapel to make their annual retreat before the feast day of their
      patron saint. Time has gone on and brought with it its changes.
      Even in the last few years what changes can most of you not
      remember? Many of the boys who sat in those front benches a
      few short years ago are perhaps now in distant lands, in the
      burning tropics or immersed in professional duties or in sem-
      inaries or voyaging over the vast expanse of the deep or, it may
      be, already called by the great God to another life and to the
      rendering up of their stewardship. And still as the years roll by,
      bringing with them changes for good and bad, the memory of
      the great saint is honoured by the boys of his college who make
      every year their annual retreat on the days preceding the feast
      day set apart by our holy mother  the church to transmit to all
      the ages the name and fame of one of the greatest sons of
      catholic Spain.</p>
       <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Arnall</span>―Now what is the meaning of this word <span class="emph">retreat</span> and why is it
      allowed on all hands to be a most salutary practice for all who
      desire to lead before God and in the eyes of men a truly chris-
      tian life? A retreat, my dear boys, signifies a withdrawal for a
      while from the cares of our life, the cares of this workaday
      world, in order to examine the state of our conscience, to
      reflect on the mysteries of holy religion and to understand
      better why we are here in this world. During these few days I
      intend to put before you some thoughts concerning the four
      last things. They are, as you know from your catechism, death,
      judgment, hell and heaven. We shall try to understand them
      fully during these few days so that we may derive from the
      understanding of them a lasting benefit to our souls. And re-
      member, my dear boys, that we have been sent into this world
      for one thing and for one thing alone: to do God's holy will
      and to save our immortal souls. All else is worthless. One thing
      alone is needful, the salvation of one's soul. What doth it profit
      a man to gain the whole world if he suffer the loss of his
      immortal soul? Ah, my dear boys, believe me there is nothing in
      this wretched world that can make up for such a loss.</p>
       <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Arnall</span>―I will ask you therefore, my dear boys, to put away from
      your minds during these few days all worldly thoughts,
      whether of study or pleasure or ambition, and to give all your
      attention to the state of your souls. I need hardly remind you
      that during the days of the retreat all boys are expected to
      preserve a quiet and pious demeanour and to shun all loud
      unseemly pleasure. The elder boys, of course, will see that this
      custom is not infringed and I look especially to the prefects and
      officers of the sodality of Our Blessed Lady and of the sodality
      of the holy angels to set a good example to their fellowstu-

      <p class="textParagraph"><p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Arnall</span>―Let us try therefore to make this retreat in honour of saint
      Francis with our whole heart and our whole mind. God's bless-
      ing will then be upon all your year's studies. But, above and
      beyond all, let this retreat be one to which you can look back in
      after years when maybe you are far from this college and
      among very different surroundings, to which you can look back
      with joy and thankfulness and give thanks to God for having
      granted you this occasion of laying the first foundation of a
      pious honourable zealous christian life. And if, as may so
      happen, there be at this moment in these benches any poor soul
      which has had the unutterable misfortune to lose God's holy
      grace and to fall into grievous sin I fervently trust and pray that
      this retreat may be the turningpoint in the life of that soul. I
      pray to God  through the merits of His zealous servant Francis
      Xavier that such a soul may be led to sincere repentance and
      that the holy communion on saint Francis' day of this year may
      be a lasting covenant between God and that soul. For just and
      unjust, for saint and sinner alike, may this retreat be a mem-
      orable one.</p>
       <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Arnall</span>―Help me, my dear little brothers in Christ. Help me by your
      pious attention, by your own devotion, by your outward de-
      meanour. Banish from your minds all worldly thoughts and
      think only of the last things, death, judgment, hell and heaven.
      He who remembers these things, says Ecclesiastes, shall not sin
      for ever. He who remembers the last things will act and think
      with them always before his eyes. He will live a good life and
      die a good death, believing and knowing that, if he has sacri-
      ficed much in this earthly life, it will be given to him a
      hundredfold and a thousandfold more in the life to come, in the
      kingdom without end – a blessing, my dear boys, which I wish
      you from my heart; one and all, in the name of the Father and
      of the Son and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.</p></p>
      <p class="textParagraph"> As he walked home with silent companions a thick fog
      seemed to compass his mind. He waited in stupor of mind till it
      should lift and reveal what it had hidden. He ate his dinner
      with surly appetite and, when the meal was over and the
      greasestrewn plates lay abandoned on the table, he rose and
      went to the window, clearing the thick scum from his mouth
      with his tongue and licking it from his lips. So he had sunk to
      the state of a beast that licks his chaps after meat. This was the
      end: and a faint glimmer of fear began to pierce the fog of his
      mind. He pressed his face against the pane of the window and
      gazed out into the darkening street. Forms passed this way and
      that way through the dull light. And that was life. The letters
      of the name of Dublin lay heavily upon his mind, pushing one
      another surlily hither and thither with slow boorish insistence.
      His soul was fattening and congealing into a gross grease,
      plunging ever deeper in its dull fear into a sombre threatening
      dusk, while the body that was his stood, listless and dishon-
      oured, gazing out of darkened eyes, helpless, perturbed and
      human for a bovine god to stare upon.</p>
      <p class="textParagraph"> The next day brought death and judgment, stirring his soul
      slowly from its listless despair. The faint glimmer of fear be-
      came a terror of spirit as the hoarse voice of the preacher blew
      death into his soul. He suffered its agony. He felt the deathchill
      touch the extremities and creep onward towards the heart, the
      film of death veiling the eyes, the bright centres of the brain
      extinguished one by one like lamps, the last sweat oozing upon
      the skin, the powerlessness of the dying limbs, the speech
      thickening and wandering and failing, the heart throbbing
      faintly and more faintly, all but vanquished, the breath, the
      poor timid breath, the poor helpless human spirit, sobbing and
      sighing, gurgling  and rattling in the throat. No help! No help!
      He, he himself, his body to which he had yielded was dying.
      Into the grave with it! Nail it down into a wooden box, the
      corpse. Carry it out of the house on the shoulders of hirelings.
      Thrust it out of men's sight into a long hole in the ground, into
      the grave, to rot, to feed the mass of its creeping worms and to
      be devoured by scuttling plumpbellied rats.</p>
      <p class="textParagraph"> And while the friends were still standing in tears by the
      bedside the soul of the sinner was judged. At the last moment
      of consciousness the whole earthly life passed before the vision
      of the soul and, ere it had time to reflect, the body had died and
      the soul stood terrified before the judgmentseat. God, who had
      long been merciful, would then be just. He had long been
      patient, pleading with the sinful soul, giving it time to repent,
      sparing it yet awhile. But that time had gone. Time was to sin
      and to enjoy, time was to scoff at God and at  the warnings of
      His holy church, time was to defy His majesty, to disobey His
      commands, to hoodwink one's fellow men, to commit sin after
      sin and sin after sin and to hide one's corruption from the sight
      of men. But that time was over. Now it was God's turn: and He
      was not to be hoodwinked or deceived. Every sin would then
      come forth from its lurkingplace, the most rebellious against
      the divine will and the most degrading to our poor corrupt
      nature, the tiniest imperfection and the most heinous atrocity.
      What did it avail then to have been a great emperor, a great
      general, a marvellous inventor, the most learned of the learned?
      All were as one before the judgmentseat of God. He would
      reward the good and punish the wicked. One single instant was
      enough for the trial of a man's soul. One single instant after the
      body's death, the soul had been weighed in the balance. The
      particular judgment was over and the soul had passed to the
      abode of bliss or to the prison of purgatory or had been hurled
      howling into hell.</p>
      <p class="textParagraph"> Nor was that all. God's justice had still to be vindicated
      before men: after the particular there still remained the general
      judgment. The last day had come. The doomsday was at hand.
      The stars of heaven were falling upon the earth like the figs
      cast by the figtree which the wind has shaken. The sun, the
      great luminary of the universe, had become as sackcloth of
      hair. The moon was bloodred. The firmament was as a scroll
      rolled away. The archangel Michael, the prince of the heavenly
      host, appeared glorious and terrible against the sky. With one
      foot on the sea and one foot on the land he blew from the
      archangelical trumpet the brazen death of time. The three
      blasts of the angel filled all the universe. Time is, time was but
      time shall be no more. At the last blast the souls of universal
      humanity throng towards the valley of Jehoshaphat, rich and
      poor, gentle and simple, wise and foolish, good and wicked.
      The soul of every human being that has ever existed, the souls
      of all those who shall yet be born, all the sons and daughters of
      Adam, all are assembled on that supreme day. And lo the
      supreme judge is coming! No longer the lowly Lamb of God,
      no longer the meek Jesus of Nazareth, no longer the Man of
      Sorrows, no longer the Good Shepherd,  He is seen now coming
      upon the clouds, in great power and majesty, attended by nine
      choirs of angels, angels and archangels, principalities, powers
      and virtues, thrones and dominations, cherubim and seraphim,
      God Omnipotent, God Everlasting. He speaks: and His voice is
      heard even at the farthest limits of space, even in the bottom-
      less abyss. Supreme Judge, from His sentence there will be and
      can be no appeal. He calls the just to His side bidding them
      enter into the kingdom, the eternity of bliss prepared for them.
      The unjust He casts from Him, crying in His offended majesty:
      <span class="emph">Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire which was</span>
      <span class="emph">prepared for the devil and his angels.</span> O what agony then for
      the miserable sinners! Friend is torn apart from friend, children are torn
      from their parents, husbands from their wives. The poor sinner
      holds out his arms to those who were dear and near to him in
      this earthly world, to those whose simple piety perhaps he
      made a mock of, to those who counselled him and tried to lead
      him on the right path, to a kind brother, to a loving sister, to
      the mother and father who loved him so dearly. But it is too
      late: the just turn away from the wretched damned souls which
      now appear before the eyes of all in their hideous and evil
      character. O you hypocrites, O you whited sepulchres, O you
      who present a smooth smiling face to the world while your soul
      within is a foul swamp of sin, how will it fare with you in that
      terrible day?</p>
      <p class="textParagraph"> And this day will come, shall come, must come: the day of
      death and the day of judgment. It is appointed unto man to die
      and after death the judgment. Death is certain. The time and
      manner are uncertain,  whether from long disease or from some
      unexpected accident: the Son of God cometh at an hour when
      you little expect Him. Be therefore ready every moment, seeing
      that you may die at any moment. Death is the end of us all.
      Death and judgment, brought into the world by the sin of our
      first parents, are the dark portals that close our earthly exist-
      ence, the portals that open into the unknown and the unseen,
      portals through which every soul must pass, alone, unaided
      save by its good works, without friend or  brother or parents or
      master to help it, alone and trembling. Let that thought be ever
      before our minds and then we cannot sin. Death, a cause of
      terror to the sinner, is a blessed moment for him who has
      walked in the right path, fulfilling the duties of his station in
      life, attending to his morning and evening prayers, approaching
      the holy sacrament frequently and performing good and mer-
      ciful works. For the pious and believing catholic, for the just
      man, death is no cause of terror. Was it not Addison, the great
      English writer, who, when on his deathbed, sent for the wicked
      young earl of Warwick to let him see how a christian can meet
      his end? He it is and he alone, the pious and believing christian,
      who can say in his heart:</p>
      <p class="lg">
        O grave, where is thy victory?
        O death, where is thy sting?
      </p>
      <p class="textParagraph"> Every word of it was for him. Against his sin, foul and
      secret, the whole wrath of God was aimed. The preacher's
      knife had probed deeply into his diseased conscience and he felt
      now that his soul was festering in sin. Yes, the preacher was
      right. God's turn had come. Like a beast in its lair his soul had
      lain down in its own filth but the blasts of the angel's trumpet
      had driven him forth from the darkness of sin into the light.
      The words of doom cried by the angel shattered in an instant
      his presumptuous peace. The wind of the last day blew through
      his mind; his sins, the jeweleyed harlots of his imagination, fled
      before the hurricane, squeaking like mice in their terror and
      huddled under a mane of hair.</p>
      <p class="textParagraph"> As he crossed the square, walking homeward, the light
      laughter of a girl reached his burning ears. The frail gay sound
      smote his heart more strongly than a trumpetblast, and, not
      daring to lift his eyes, he turned aside and gazed, as he walked,
      into the shadow of the tangled shrubs. Shame rose from his
      smitten heart and flooded his whole being. The image of Emma
      appeared before him and, under her eyes, the flood of shame
      rushed forth anew from his heart. If she knew to what his mind
      had subjected her or how his brutelike lust had torn and
      trampled upon her innocence! Was that boyish love? Was that
      chivalry? Was that poetry? The sordid details of his orgies stank
      under his very nostrils: the sootcoated packet of pictures which
      he had hidden in the flue of the fireplace and in the presence of
      whose shameless or bashful  wantonness he lay for hours sin-
      ning in thought and deed: his monstrous dreams, peopled by
      apelike creatures and by harlots with gleaming jewel eyes: the
      foul long letters he had written in the joy of guilty confession
      and carried secretly for days and days only to throw them
      under cover of night among the grass in the corner of a field or
      beneath some hingeless door or in some niche in the hedges
      where a girl might come upon them as she walked by and read
      them secretly. Mad! Mad! Was it possible he had done these
      things? A cold sweat broke out upon his forehead as the foul
      memories condensed within his brain.</p>
      <p class="textParagraph"> When the agony of shame had passed from him he tried to
      raise his soul from its abject powerlessness. God and the
      Blessed Virgin were too far from him: God was too great and
      stern and the Blessed Virgin too pure and holy. But he imagined
      that he stood near Emma in a wide land and,  humbly  and in
      tears, bent and kissed the elbow of her sleeve.</p>
      <p class="textParagraph"> In a wide land under a tender lucid evening sky, a cloud
      drifting westward amid a pale green sea of heaven, they stood
      together, children that had  erred. Their error had offended
      deeply God's majesty, though it was the error of two children,
      but it had not offended her whose beauty <span class="emph">is not like earthly</span>
      <span class="emph">beauty, dangerous to look upon, but like the morning star</span>
      <span class="emph">which is its emblem, bright and musical</span>. The eyes were not
      offended which she turned upon them nor reproachful. She
      placed their hands together, hand in hand, and said, speaking
      to their hearts:
       <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Virgin Mary</span>―Take hands, Stephen and Emma. It is a beautiful evening
      now in heaven. You have erred but you are always my children.
      It is one heart that loves another heart. Take hands together,
      my dear children, and you  will  be happy together and your
      hearts will love each other.</p></p>
      <p class="textParagraph"> The chapel was flooded by the dull scarlet light that filtered
      through the lowered blinds: and through the fissure between
      the last blind and the sash a shaft of wan light entered like a
      spear and touched the embossed brasses of the candlesticks
      upon the altar that gleamed like the battleworn mail armour of
      angels.</p>
      <p class="textParagraph"> Rain was falling on the chapel, on the garden, on the college.
      It would rain for ever, noiselessly. The water would rise inch
      by inch, covering the grass and shrubs, covering the trees and
      houses, covering the monuments and the mountain tops. All
      life would be choked off, noiselessly: birds, men, elephants,
      pigs, children: noiselessly floating corpses amid the litter of the
      wreckage of the world. Forty days and forty nights the rain
      would fall till the waters covered the face of the earth.</p>
      <p class="textParagraph"> It might be. Why not?
       <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Arnall</span>―<span class="emph">Hell has enlarged its soul and opened its mouth without any</span>
      <span class="emph">limits</span> – words taken, my dear little brothers in Christ Jesus,
      from the book of Isaias, fifth chapter, fourteenth verse. In the
      name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.
      Amen.</p></p>
      <p class="textParagraph"> The preacher took a chainless watch from a pocket within
      his soutane and, having considered its dial for a moment in
      silence, placed it silently before him on the table.</p>
      <p class="textParagraph"> He began  to speak in a quiet tone.
       <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Arnall</span>―Adam and Eve, my dear boys, were, as you know, our first
      parents and you will remember that they were created by God
      in order that the seats in heaven left vacant by the fall of
      Lucifer and his rebellious angels might be filled again. Lucifer,
      we are  told, was a son of the morning, a radiant and mighty
      angel; yet he fell: he fell and there fell with him a third part of
      the host of heaven: he fell and was hurled with his rebellious
      angels into hell. What his sin was we cannot say. Theologians
      consider that it was the sin of pride, the sinful thought con-
      ceived in an instant: <span class="emph">non serviam: I will not serve</span>. That instant
      was his ruin. He offended the majesty of God by the sinful
      thought of one instant and God cast him out of heaven into hell
      for ever.</p>
       <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Arnall</span>―Adam and Eve were then created by God and placed in
      Eden, that lovely garden in the plain of Damascus that lovely garden resplendent
      with sunlight and colour, teeming with luxuriant vegetation.
      The fruitful earth gave them her bounty: beasts and birds were
      their willing servants: they knew not the ills our flesh is heir to,
      disease and poverty and death: all that a great and generous
      God could do for them was done. But there was one condition
      imposed on them by God: obedience to His word. They were
      not to eat of the fruit of the forbidden tree.</p>
       <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Arnall</span>―Alas, my dear little boys, they too fell. The devil, once a
      shining angel, a son of the morning, now a foul fiend came to
      them in the shape of a serpent, the subtlest of all the beasts of
      the field. He envied them. He, the fallen great one, could not
      bear to think that man, a being of clay, should possess the
      inheritance which he by his sin had forfeited for ever. He came
      to the woman, the weaker vessel, and poured the poison of his
      eloquence into her ear, promising her  (O, the blasphemy of that
      promise!) that if she and Adam ate of the forbidden fruit they
      would become as gods, nay as God Himself. Eve yielded to the
      wiles of the archtempter. She ate the apple and gave it also to
      Adam who had not the moral courage to resist her. The poison
      tongue of Satan had done its work. They fell.</p>
       <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Arnall</span>―And then the voice of God was heard in that garden, calling
      His creature man to account: and Michael, prince of the heav-
      enly host, with a sword of flame in his hand appeared before
      the guilty pair and drove them forth from Eden into the world,
      the world of sickness and striving, of cruelty and disappoint-
      ment, of labour and hardship, to earn their bread in the sweat
      of their brow. But even then how merciful was God! He took
      pity on our poor degraded first parents and promised that in
      the fulness of time He would send down from heaven One who
      would redeem them, make them once more children of God
      and heirs to the kingdom of heaven: and that One, that
      Redeemer of fallen man, was to be God's onlybegotten  Son, the
      Second Person of the Most Blessed Trinity, the Eternal Word.</p>
       <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Arnall</span>―He came. He was born of a virgin pure, Mary the virgin
      mother. He was born in a poor cowhouse in Judea and lived as
      a humble carpenter for thirty years until the hour of His
      mission had come. And then, filled with love for men, He went
      forth and called to men to hear the new gospel.</p>
       <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Arnall</span>―Did they listen? Yes, they listened but would not hear. He
      was seized and bound like a common criminal, mocked at as a
      fool, set aside to give place to a public robber, scourged with
      five thousand lashes, crowned with a crown of thorns, hustled
      through the streets by the jewish rabble and the Roman sol-
      diery, stripped of His garments and hanged upon a gibbet and
      His side was pierced with a lance and from the wounded body
      of Our Lord water and blood issued continually.</p>
       <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Arnall</span>―Yet even then, in that hour of supreme agony, Our Merciful
      Redeemer had pity for mankind. Yet even there, on the hill of
      Calvary, He founded the holy catholic church against which, it
      is promised, the gates of hell shall not prevail. He founded it
      upon the rock of ages and endowed it with His grace, with
      sacraments and sacrifice, and promised that if men would obey
      the word of His church they would still enter into eternal life
      but if, after all that had been done for them, they still persisted
      in their wickedness there  remained for them an eternity of
      torment: hell.</p></p>
      <p class="textParagraph"> The preacher's voice sank. He paused, joined his palms for
      an instant, parted them. Then he resumed:
       <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Arnall</span>―Now let us try for a moment to realise, as far as we can, the
      nature of that abode of the damned which the justice of an
      offended God has called into existence for the eternal punish-
      ment of sinners. Hell is a strait and dark and foulsmelling
      prison, an abode of demons and lost souls, filled with fire and
      smoke. The straitness of this prison house is expressly designed
      by God to punish those who refused to be bound by His laws.
      In earthly prisons the poor captive has at least some liberty of
      movement, were it only within the four walls of his cell or in
      the gloomy yard of his prison. Not so in hell. There, by reason
      of the great number of the damned, the prisoners are heaped
      together in their awful prison the walls of which are said to be
      four thousand miles thick: and the damned are so utterly
      bound and helpless that, as a blessed saint, saint Anselm, writes
      in his book on similitudes, they are not even able to remove
      from the eye a worm that gnaws it.</p>
       <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Arnall</span>―They lie in exterior darkness. For, remember, the fire of hell
      gives forth no light. As, at the command of God, the fire of the
      Babylonian furnace lost its heat but not its light so, at the
      command of God, the fire of hell, while retaining the intensity
      of its heat, burns eternally in darkness. It is a neverending
      storm of darkness, dark flames and dark smoke of burning
      brimstone, amid which the bodies are heaped one upon another
      without even a glimpse of air. Of all the plagues with which the
      land of the Pharaohs was smitten one plague alone, that of
      darkness, was called horrible. What name, then, shall we give
      to the darkness of hell which is to last not for three days alone
      but for all eternity?</p>
       <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Arnall</span>―The horror of this strait and dark prison is increased by its
      awful stench. All the filth of the world, all the offal and scum
      of the world, we are told, shall run there as to a vast reeking
      sewer when the terrible conflagration of the last day has purged
      the world. The brimstone too which burns there in such pro-
      digious quantity fills all hell with its intolerable stench: and the
      bodies of the damned themselves exhale such a pestilential
      odour that, as saint Bonaventure says, one of them alone would
      suffice to infect the whole world. The very air of this world,
      that pure element, becomes foul and unbreathable when it has
      been long enclosed. Consider then what must be the foulness of
      the air of hell. Imagine some foul and putrid corpse that has
      lain rotting and decomposing in the grave, a jellylike mass of
      liquid corruption. Imagine such a corpse a prey to  flames,
      devoured by the fire of burning brimstone and giving off dense
      choking fumes of nauseous loathsome decomposition. And
      then imagine this sickening stench, multiplied a millionfold and
      a millionfold again from the millions upon millions of fetid
      carcases massed together in the reeking darkness,  a huge and
      rotting human fungus. Imagine all this and you will have some
      idea of the horror of the stench of hell.</p>
       <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Arnall</span>―But this stench is not, horrible though it is, the greatest
      physical torment to which the damned are subjected. The
      torment of fire is the greatest torment to which the tyrant has
      ever subjected his fellowcreatures. Place your finger for a mo-
      ment in the flame of a candle and you will feel the pain of fire.
      But our earthly fire was created by God for the benefit of man,
      to maintain in him the spark of life and to help him in the
      useful arts whereas the fire of hell is of another quality and was
      created by God to torture and punish the unrepentant sinner.
      Our earthly fire also consumes more or less rapidly according
      as the object which it attacks is more or less combustible so
      that human ingenuity has even succeeded in inventing chemical
      preparations to check or frustrate its action. But the sulphu-
      reous brimstone which burns in hell is a substance which is
      specially designed to burn for ever and for ever with unspeak-
      able fury. Moreover our earthly fire destroys at the same time
      as it burns so that the more intense it is the shorter is its dur-
      ation: but the fire of hell has this property that it preserves that
      which it burns and though it rages with incredible intensity it
      rages for ever.</p>
       <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Arnall</span>―Our earthly fire again, no matter how fierce or widespread it
      may be, is always of a limited extent: but the lake of fire in hell
      is boundless, shoreless and bottomless. It is on record that the
      devil himself, when asked the question by a certain soldier, was
      obliged to confess that if a whole mountain were thrown into
      the burning ocean of hell it would be burned up in an instant
      like a piece of wax. And this terrible fire will not afflict the
      bodies of the damned only from without but each lost soul will
      be a hell unto itself, the boundless fire raging in its very vitals.
      O, how terrible is the lot of those wretched beings! The blood
      seethes and boils in the veins, the brains are boiling in the skull,
      the heart in the breast glowing and bursting, the bowels a
      redhot mass of burning pulp, the tender eyes flaming like mol-
      ten balls.</p>
       <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Arnall</span>―And yet what I have said as to the strength and quality and
      boundlessness of this fire is as nothing when compared to its
      intensity, an intensity which it has as being the instrument
      chosen by divine design for the punishment of soul and body
      alike. It is a fire which proceeds directly from the ire of God,
      working not of its own activity but as an instrument of divine
      vengeance. As the waters of baptism cleanse the soul with the
      body so do the fires of punishment torture the spirit with the
      flesh. Every sense of the flesh is tortured and every faculty of
      the soul therewith: the eyes with impenetrable utter darkness,
      the nose with noisome odours, the ears with yells and howls
      and execrations, the taste with foul matter, leprous corruption,
      nameless suffocating filth, the touch with redhot goads and
      spikes, with cruel tongues of flame. And through the several
      torments of the senses the immortal soul is tortured eternally in
      its very essence amid the leagues upon leagues of glowing fires
      kindled in the abyss by the offended majesty of the Omnipotent
      God and fanned into everlasting and ever increasing fury by the
      breath of the anger of the Godhead.</p>
       <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Arnall</span>―Consider finally that the torment of this infernal prison is
      increased by the company of the damned themselves. Evil com-
      pany on earth is so noxious that even the plants, as if by
      instinct, withdraw from the company of whatsoever is deadly
      or hurtful to them. In hell all laws are overturned: there is no
      thought of family or country, of ties or relationship. The
      damned howl and scream at one another, their torture and rage
      intensified by the presence of beings tortured and raging like
      themselves. All sense of humanity is forgotten. The yells of the
      suffering sinners fill the remotest corners of the vast abyss. The
      mouths of the damned are full of blasphemies against God and
      of hatred for their fellow sufferers and of curses against those
      souls which were their  accomplices in sin. In olden times it was
      the custom to punish the parricide, the man who had raised his
      murderous hand against his father, by casting him into the
      depths of the sea in a sack in which were placed a cock, a
      monkey and a serpent. The intention of those lawgivers who
      framed such a law, which seems cruel in our times, was to
      punish the criminal by the company of hateful and hurtful
      beasts. But what is the fury of those dumb beasts compared
      with the fury of execration which bursts from the parched lips
      and aching throats of the damned in hell when they behold in
      their companions in misery those who aided and abetted them
      in sin, those whose words sowed the first seeds of evil thinking
      and evil living in their minds, those whose immodest sugges-
      tions led them on to sin, those whose eyes tempted and allured
      them from the path of virtue. They turn upon those accom-
      plices and upbraid them and curse them. But they are helpless
      and hopeless: it is too late now for repentance.</p>
       <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Arnall</span>―Last of all consider the frightful torment to those damned
      souls, tempters and tempted alike,  of the company of the devils.
      These devils will afflict the damned in two ways, by their pres-
      ence and by their reproaches. We can have no idea of how
      horrible these devils are. Saint Catherine of Siena once saw a
      devil and she has written that, rather than look again for one
      single instant on such a frightful monster, she would prefer to
      walk until the end of her life along a track of red coals. These
      devils, who were once beautiful angels, have become as hideous
      and ugly as they once were beautiful. They mock and  jeer at
      the lost souls whom they dragged down to ruin. It is they, the
      foul demons, who are made in hell the voices of conscience.
      Why did you sin? Why did you lend an ear to the temptings of
      fiends? Why did you turn aside from your pious practices and
      good works? Why did you not shun the occasions of sin? Why
      did you not leave that evil companion? Why did you not give
      up that lewd habit, that impure habit? Why did you not listen
      to the counsels of your confessor? Why did you not, even after
      you had fallen the first or the second or the third or the fourth
      or the hundredth time, repent of your evil ways and turn to
      God who only waited for your repentance to absolve you of
      your sins? Now the time for repentance has gone by. Time is,
      time was but time shall be no more! Time was to sin in secrecy,
      to indulge in that sloth and pride, to covet the unlawful, to
      yield to the promptings of your lower nature, to live like the
      beasts of the field, nay worse than the beasts of the field for
      they, at least, are but brutes and have not reason to guide them:
      time was but time shall be no more. God spoke to you by so
      many voices but you would not hear. You would not crush out
      that pride and anger in your heart, you would not restore those
      illgotten goods, you would not obey the precepts of your holy
      church nor attend to your religious duties, you would not
      abandon those wicked companions, you would not avoid those
      dangerous temptations. Such is the language of those fiendish
      tormentors, words of taunting and of reproach, of hatred and
      of disgust. Of disgust, yes! For even they, the very devils, when
      they sinned sinned by such a sin as alone was compatible with
      such angelical natures, a rebellion of the intellect: and they,
      even they, the foul devils must turn away, revolted and dis-
      gusted, from the contemplation of those unspeakable sins by
      which degraded man outrages and defiles the temple of the
      Holy Ghost, defiles and pollutes himself.</p>
       <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Arnall</span>―O, my dear little brothers in Christ, may it never be our lot
      to hear that language! May it never be our lot, I say! In the last
      day of terrible reckoning I pray fervently to God that not a
      single soul of those who are in this chapel today may be found
      among those miserable beings whom the Great Judge shall
      command to depart for ever from His sight, that not one of us
      may ever hear ringing in his ears the awful sentence of rejec-
      tion: <span class="emph">Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire which</span>
      <span class="emph">was prepared for the devil and his angels!</span></p></p>
      <p class="textParagraph"> He came down the aisle of the chapel, his legs shaking and
      the scalp of his head trembling as though it had been touched
      by ghostly fingers. He passed up the staircase and into the
      corridor along the walls of which the overcoats and water-
      proofs hung like gibbeted malefactors, headless and dripping
      and shapeless. And at every step he feared that he had already
      died, that his soul had been wrenched forth of the sheath of his
      body, that he was plunging headlong through space.</p>
      <p class="textParagraph"> He could not grip the floor with his feet and sat heavily at
      his desk, opening one of his books at random and poring over
      it. Every word for him! It was true. God was almighty. God
      could call him now, call him as he sat at his desk, before he had
      time to be conscious of the summons. God had called him. Yes?
      What? Yes? His flesh shrank together as it felt the approach of
      the ravenous tongues of flames, dried up as it felt about it the
      swirl of stifling air. He had died. Yes. He was judged. A wave
      of fire swept through his body: the first. Again a wave. His
      brain began to glow. Another. His brain was simmering and
      bubbling within the cracking tenement of the skull. Flames
      burst forth from his skull like a corolla, shrieking like voices:
       <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Flames</span>―Hell! Hell! Hell! Hell! Hell!</p></p>
      <p class="textParagraph"> Voices spoke near him:
       <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">a voice</span>―On hell.</p>
       <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">a voice</span>―I suppose he rubbed it into you well.</p>
       <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">a voice</span>―You bet he did. He put us all into a blue funk.</p>
       <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">a voice</span>―That's what you fellows want: and plenty of it to make you
      work.</p></p>
      <p class="textParagraph"> He leaned back weakly in his desk. He had not died. God
      had spared him still. He was still in the familiar world of the
      school. Mr Tate and Vincent Heron stood at the window,
      talking, jesting, gazing out at the bleak rain, moving their }|lb n="30833"/| heads.
      <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Tate</span>―I wish it would clear up. I had arranged to go for a spin on
      the bike with some fellows out by <span class="hide">53.450924 -6.150138</span>Malahide. But the roads
      must be kneedeep.</p>
      <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Vincent Heron</span>―It might clear up, sir.</p></p>
      <p class="textParagraph">The voices that he knew so well, the common words, the
      quiet of the classroom when the voices paused and the silence
      was filled by the sound of softly browsing cattle as the other
      boys munched their lunches tranquilly, lulled his aching soul.</p>
      <p class="textParagraph"> There was still time. O Mary, refuge of sinners, intercede for
      him! O Virgin Undefiled, save him from the gulf of death!</p>
      <p class="textParagraph"> The English lesson began with the hearing of the history.
      Royal persons, favourites, intriguers, bishops passed like mute
      phantoms behind their veil of names. All had died: all had been
      judged. What did it profit a man to gain the whole world if he
      lost his soul? At last he had understood: and human life lay
      around him, a plain of peace whereon antlike men laboured in
      brotherhood, their dead sleeping under quiet mounds. The el-
      bow of his companion touched him and his heart was touched:
      and when he spoke to answer a question of his master he heard
      his own voice full of the quietude of humility and contrition.</p>
      <p class="textParagraph"> His soul sank back deeper into depths of contrite peace, no
      longer able to suffer the pain of dread and sending forth, as she
      sank, a faint prayer. Ah yes, he would still be spared; he would
      repent in his heart and be forgiven: and then those above, those
      in heaven, would see what he would do to make up for the
      past: a whole life, every hour of life. Only wait.
       <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>―All, God! All, all!</p></p>
      <p class="textParagraph"> A messenger came to the door to say that confessions were
      being heard in the chapel. Four boys left the room; and he
      heard others passing down the corridor. A tremulous chill blew
      round his heart, no stronger than a little wind, and yet, listen-
      ing and suffering silently, he seemed to have laid an ear against
      the muscle of his own heart, feeling it close and quail, listening
      to the flutter of its ventricles.</p>
      <p class="textParagraph"> No escape. He had to confess, to speak out in words what he
      had done and thought, sin after sin. How? How?
       <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>―Father, I ...</p></p>
      <p class="textParagraph">The thought slid like a cold shining rapier into his tender
      flesh: confession. But not there in the chapel of the college. He
      would confess all, every sin of deed and thought, sincerely: but
      not there among his school companions. Far away from there
      in some dark place he would murmur out his own shame: and
      he besought God humbly not to be offended with him if he did
      not dare to confess in the college chapel: and in utter abjection
      of spirit he craved forgiveness mutely of the boyish hearts
      about him.</p>
      <p class="textParagraph"> Time passed.</p>
      <p class="textParagraph"> He sat again in the front bench of the chapel. The daylight
      without was already failing and, as it fell slowly through the
      dull red blinds, it seemed that the sun of the last day was going
      down and that all souls were being gathered for the judgment.
       <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Arnall</span>―<span class="emph">I am cast away from the sight of Thine eyes:</span> words taken,
      my dear little brothers in Christ, from the Book of Psalms,
      thirtieth chapter, twentythird verse. In the name of the Father

      <p class="textParagraph"> The preacher began to speak in a quiet friendly tone. His
      face was kind and he joined gently the fingers of each hand,
      forming a frail cage by the union of their tips.
       <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Arnall</span>―This morning we endeavoured, in our reflection upon hell,
      to make what our holy founder calls in his book of spiritual
      exercises, the composition of place. We endeavoured, that is, to
      imagine with the senses of the mind, in our imagination, the
      material character of that awful place and of the physical tor-
      ments which all who are in hell endure. This evening we shall
      consider for a few moments the nature of the spiritual torments
      of hell.</p>
       <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Arnall</span>―Sin, remember, is a twofold enormity. It is a base consent to
      the promptings of our corrupt nature, to the lower instincts, to
      that which is gross and beastlike; and it is also a turning away
      from the counsel of our higher nature, from all that is pure and
      holy, from the Holy God Himself. For this reason mortal sin is
      punished in hell by two different forms of punishment, physical
      and spiritual.</p>
       <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Arnall</span>―Now of all these spiritual pains by far the greatest is the pain
      of loss, so great, in fact, that in itself it is a torment greater
      than all the others. Saint Thomas, the greatest doctor of the
      church, the angelic doctor, as he is called, says that the worst
      damnation consists in this that the understanding of man is
      totally deprived of divine light and his affection obstinately
      turned away from the goodness of God. God, remember, is a
      being infinitely good and therefore the loss of such a being
      must be a loss infinitely painful. In this life we have not a very
      clear idea of what such a loss must be but the damned in hell,
      for their greater torment, have a full understanding of that
      which they have lost and understand  that they have lost it
      through their own sins and have lost it for ever. At the very
      instant of death the bonds of the flesh are broken asunder and
      the soul at once flies towards God. The soul tends towards
      God as towards the centre of her existence. Remember, my
      dear little boys, our souls long to be with God. We come from
      God, we live by God, we belong to God: we are His, inalien-
      ably His. God loves with a divine love every human soul and
      every human soul lives in that love. How could it be otherwise?
      Every breath that we draw, every thought of our brain, every
      instant of life proceed from God's inexhaustible goodness. And
      if it be pain for a mother to be parted from her child, for a man
      to be exiled from hearth and home, for friend to be sundered
      from friend, O think what pain, what anguish it must be for
      the poor soul to be spurned from the presence of the supremely
      good and loving Creator Who has called that soul into exist-
      ence from nothingness and sustained it in life and loved it with
      an immeasurable love. This, then, to be separated for ever from
      its greatest good, from God, and to feel the anguish of that
      separation, knowing full well that it is unchangeable, this is the
      greatest torment which the created soul is capable of bearing,
      poena damni, the pain of loss.</p>
       <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Arnall</span>―The second pain which will afflict the souls of the damned in
      hell is the pain of conscience. Just as in dead bodies worms are
      engendered by putrefaction so in the souls of the lost there
      arises a perpetual remorse from the putrefaction of sin, the
      sting of conscience, the worm, as Pope Innocent the Third calls
      it, of the triple sting. The first sting inflicted by this cruel worm
      will be the memory of past pleasures. O what a dreadful mem-
      ory will that be! In the lake of alldevouring flame the proud
      king will remember the pomps of his court, the wise but wicked
      man his libraries and instruments of research, the lover of ar-
      tistic pleasures his marbles and pictures and other art treasures,
      he who delighted in the pleasures of the table his gorgeous
      feasts, his dishes prepared with such delicacy, his choice wines;
      the miser will remember his hoard of gold, the robber his
      illgotten wealth, the angry and revengeful and merciless mur-
      derers their deeds of blood and violence in which they revelled,
      the impure and adulterous the unspeakable and filthy pleasures
      in which they delighted. They will remember all this and loathe
      themselves and their sins. For how miserable will all those
      pleasures seem to the soul condemned to suffer in hellfire for
      ages and ages. How they will rage and fume to think that they
      have lost the bliss of heaven for the dross of earth, for a few
      pieces of metal, for vain honours, for bodily comforts, for a
      tingling of the nerves. They will repent indeed: and this is the
      second sting of the worm of conscience, a late and fruitless
      sorrow for sins committed. Divine justice insists that the under-
      standing of those miserable wretches be fixed continually on
      the sins of which they were guilty and, moreover, as saint
      Augustine points out, God will impart to them His own
      knowledge of sin so that sin will appear to them in all its
      hideous malice as it appears to the eyes of God Himself. They
      will behold their sins in all their foulness and repent but it will
      be too late and then they will bewail the good occasions which
      they neglected. This is the last and deepest and most cruel sting
      of the worm of conscience. The conscience will say: You had
      time and opportunity to repent and would not. You were
      brought up religiously by your parents. You had the sacraments
      and graces and indulgences of the church to aid you. You had
      the minister of God to preach to you, to call you back when
      you had strayed, to forgive you your sins, no matter how many,
      how abominable, if only you had confessed and repented. No.
      You would not. You flouted the ministers of holy religion, you
      turned your back on the confessional, you wallowed deeper
      and deeper in the mire of sin. God appealed to you, threatened
      you, entreated you to return to Him. O what shame, what
      misery! The ruler of the universe entreated you, a creature
      of clay, to love Him Who  made you and to keep His law.
      No. You would not. And now, though you were to flood all
      hell with your tears if you could still weep, all that sea of
      repentance would not gain for you what a single tear of true
      repentance shed during your mortal life would have gained for
      you. You implore now a moment of earthly life wherein to
      repent: in vain. That time is gone: gone for ever.</p>
       <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Arnall</span>―Such is the threefold sting of conscience, the viper which
      gnaws the very heart's core of the wretches in hell so that filled
      with hellish fury they curse themselves for their folly and curse
      the evil companions who have brought them to such ruin and
      curse the devils who tempted them in life and now mock them
      and torture them in eternity and even revile and curse the
      Supreme Being Whose goodness and patience they scorned and
      slighted but Whose justice and power they cannot evade.</p>
       <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Arnall</span>―The next spiritual pain to which the damned are subjected is
      the pain of extension. Man, in this earthly life, though he be
      capable of many evils, is not capable of them all at once inas-
      much as one evil corrects and counteracts  another just as one
      poison frequently corrects another. In hell on the contrary one
      torment, instead of counteracting another, lends it still greater
      force: and moreover as the internal faculties are more perfect
      than the external senses so are they more capable of suffering.
      Just as every sense is afflicted with a fitting torment so is every
      spiritual faculty; the fancy with horrible images, the sensitive
      faculty with alternate longing and rage, the mind and under-
      standing with an interior darkness more terrible even than the
      exterior darkness which reigns in that dreadful prison. The
      malice, impotent though it be, which possesses these demon
      souls is an evil of boundless extension, of limitless duration, a
      frightful state of wickedness which we can scarcely realise
      unless we bear in mind the enormity of sin and the hatred God
      bears to it.</p>
       <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Arnall</span>―Opposed to this pain of extension and yet coexistent with it
      we have the pain of intensity. Hell is the centre of all evils and,
      as you know, things are more intense at their centres than at
      their remotest points. There are no contraries or admixtures of
      any kind to temper or soften in the least the pains of hell. Nay,
      things which are good in themselves become evil in hell. Com-
      pany, elsewhere a source of comfort to the afflicted, will be
      there a continual torment: knowledge, so much longed for as
      the chief good of the intellect, will there be hated worse than
      ignorance: light, so much coveted by all creatures from the lord
      of creation down to the humblest plant in the forest, will be
      loathed intensely. In this life our sorrows are either not very
      long or not very great because nature either overcomes them by
      habits or puts an end to them by sinking under their weight.
      But in hell the torments cannot be overcome by habit for while
      they are of terrible intensity they are at the same time of con-
      tinual variety, each pain, so to speak, taking fire from another
      and reendowing that which has enkindled it with a still fiercer
      flame. Nor can nature escape from these intense and various
      tortures by succumbing to them for the soul in hell is sustained
      and maintained in evil so that its suffering may be the greater.
      Boundless extension of torment, incredible intensity of suffer-
      ing, unceasing variety of torture – this is what the divine
      majesty, so outraged by sinners, demands, this is what the
      holiness of heaven, slighted and set aside for the lustful and low
      pleasures of the corrupt flesh, requires, this is what the blood
      of the innocent Lamb of God, shed for the redemption of
      sinners, trampled upon by the vilest of the vile, insists upon.</p>
       <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Arnall</span>―Last and crowning torture of all the tortures of that awful
      place is the eternity of hell. Eternity! O dread and dire word.
      Eternity! What mind of man can understand it? And, remem-
      ber, it is an eternity of pain. Even though the pains of hell were
      not so terrible as they are yet they would become infinite as
      they are destined to last for ever. But while they are everlasting
      they are at the same time, as you know, intolerably intense,
      unbearably extensive. To bear even the sting of an insect for  all
      eternity would be a dreadful torment. What must it be then to
      bear the manifold tortures of hell for ever. For ever! For all
      eternity! Not for a year or for an age but for ever. Try to
      imagine the awful meaning of this. You have often seen the
      sand on the seashore. How fine are its tiny grains! And how
      many of those tiny little grains go to make up the small handful
      which a child grasps in its play. Now imagine a mountain of
      that sand, a million miles high, reaching from the earth to the
      farthest heavens, and a million miles broad, extending to re-
      motest space, and a million miles in thickness: and imagine
      such an enormous mass of countless particles of sand multi-
      plied as often as there are leaves in the forest, drops of water in
      the mighty ocean, feathers on birds, scales on fish, hairs on
      animals, atoms in the vast expanse of the air: and imagine that
      at the end of every million years a little bird came to that
      mountain and carried away in its beak a tiny grain of that sand.
      How many millions upon millions of centuries would pass be-
      fore that bird had carried away even a square foot of that
      mountain, how many eons upon eons of ages before it had
      carried away all. Yet at the end of that immense stretch of time
      not even one instant of eternity could be said to have ended. At
      the end of all those billions and trillions of years eternity would
      have scarcely begun. And if that mountain rose again after it
      had been all carried away and if the bird came again and
      carried it all away again grain by grain: and if it so rose and
      sank as many times as there are stars in the sky, atoms in the
      air, drops of water in the sea, leaves on the trees, feathers upon
      birds, scales upon fish, hairs upon animals, at the end of all
      those innumerable risings and sinkings of that immeasurably
      vast mountain not one single instant of eternity could be said to
      have ended: even then, at the end of such a period, after that
      eon of time the mere thought of which makes our very brain
      reel dizzily, eternity would have scarcely begun.</p>
       <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Arnall</span>―A holy saint (one of our own fathers I believe it was) was
      once vouchsafed a vision of hell. It seemed to him that he stood
      in the midst of a great hall, dark and silent save for the ticking
      of a great clock. The ticking went on unceasingly; and it
      seemed to this saint that the sound of the ticking was the
      ceaseless repetition of the words: ever, never; ever, never. Ever
      to be in hell, never to be in heaven; ever to be shut off from the
      presence of God, never to enjoy the beatific vision; ever to be
      eaten with flames, gnawed by vermin, goaded with burning
      spikes, never to be free from those pains; ever to have the
      conscience upbraid one, the memory enrage, the mind filled
      with darkness and despair, never to escape; ever to curse and
      revile the foul demons who gloat fiendishly over the misery of
      their dupes, never to behold the shining raiment of the blessed
      spirits; ever to cry out of the abyss of fire to God for an instant,
      a single instant, of respite from such awful agony, never to
      receive, even for an instant, God's pardon; ever to suffer, never
      to enjoy; ever to be damned, never to be saved; ever, never;
      ever, never. O what a dreadful punishment! An eternity of
      endless agony, of endless bodily and spiritual torment, without
      one ray of hope, without one moment of cessation, of agony
      limitless in extent, limitless in intensity, of torment infinitely
      lasting, infinitely varied, of torture that sustains eternally that
      which it eternally devours, of anguish that everlastingly preys
      upon the spirit while it racks the flesh, an eternity, every instant
      of which is itself an eternity, and that eternity an eternity of
      woe. Such is the terrible punishment decreed for those who die
      in mortal sin by an almighty and a just God.</p>
       <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Arnall</span>―Yes, a just God! Men, reasoning always as men, are aston-
      ished that God should mete out an everlasting and infinite pun-
      ishment in the fires of hell for a single grievous sin. They
      reason thus because, blinded by the gross illusion of the flesh
      and the darkness of human understanding, they are unable to
      comprehend the hideous malice of mortal sin. They reason thus
      because they are unable to comprehend that even venial sin is
      of such a foul and hideous nature that even if the omnipotent
      Creator could end all the evil and misery in the world, the
      wars, the diseases, the robberies, the crimes, the deaths, the
      murders, on condition that He allowed a single venial sin to
      pass unpunished, a single venial sin, a lie, an angry look, a
      moment of wilful sloth, He, the great omnipotent God could
      not do so because sin, be it in thought or deed, is a trans-
      gression of His law and God would not be God if He did not
      punish the transgressor.</p>
       <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Arnall</span>―A sin, an instant of rebellious pride of the intellect, made
      Lucifer and a third part of the cohorts of angels fall from their
      glory. A sin, an instant of folly and weakness, drove Adam and
      Eve out of Eden and brought death and suffering into the
      world. To retrieve the consequences of that sin the onlybegot-
      ten Son of God came down to earth, lived and suffered and
      died a most painful death, hanging for three hours on the cross.</p>
       <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Arnall</span>―O, my dear little brethren in Christ Jesus, will we then
      offend that good Redeemer and provoke His anger? Will we
      trample again upon that torn and mangled corpse? Will we spit
      upon that face so full of sorrow and love? Will we too, like the
      cruel jews and the brutal soldiers, mock that gentle and com-
      passionate Saviour Who trod alone for our sakes the awful
      winepress of sorrow? Every word of sin is a wound in His
      tender side. Every sinful act is a thorn piercing His head. Every
      impure thought, deliberately yielded to, is a keen lance trans-
      fixing that sacred and loving heart. No, no. It is impossible for
      any human being to do that which offends so deeply the divine
      majesty, that which is punished by an eternity of agony, that
      which crucifies again the Son of God and makes a mockery of
      Him.</p>
       <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Arnall</span>―I pray to God that my poor words may have availed today to
      confirm in holiness those who are in a state of grace, to
      strengthen the wavering, to lead back to the state of grace the
      poor soul that has strayed if any such be among you. I pray to
      God, and do you pray with me, that we may repent of our sins.
      I will ask you now, all of you, to repeat after me the act of
      contrition, kneeling here in this humble chapel in the presence
      of God. He is there in the tabernacle burning with love for
      mankind, ready to comfort the afflicted. Be not afraid. No
      matter how many or how foul the sins if only you repent of
      them they will be forgiven you. Let no worldly shame hold you
      back. God is still the merciful Lord Who wishes not the eternal
      death of the sinner but rather that he be converted and live.</p>
       <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Arnall</span>―He calls you to Him. You are His. He made you out of
      nothing. He loved you as only a God can love. His arms are
      open to receive you even though you have sinned against Him.
      Come to Him, poor sinner, poor vain and erring sinner. Now is
      the acceptable time. Now is the hour.</p></p>
      <p class="textParagraph"> The priest rose and turning towards the altar knelt upon the
      step before the tabernacle in the fallen gloom. He waited till all
      in the chapel had knelt and every least noise was still. Then
      raising his head he repeated the act of contrition, phrase by
      phrase, with fervour. The boys answered him phrase by phrase.
      Stephen, his tongue cleaving to his palate, bowed his head,
      praying with his heart.</p>

      <p class="textParagraph"> He  went up to his room after dinner in order to be alone
      with his soul: and at every step his soul seemed  to sigh: at every
      step his soul mounted with his feet, sighing in the ascent,
      through a region of viscid gloom.</p>
      <p class="textParagraph"> He halted on the landing before the door  and then, grasping
      the porcelain knob, opened the door quickly. He waited in fear,
      his soul pining within him, praying silently that death might
      not touch his brow as he passed over the threshold,  that the
      fiends that inhabit darkness might not be given power over
      him. He waited still at the threshold  as at the entrance to some
      dark cave. Faces were there; eyes: they waited and watched.
       <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">murmuring faces</span>―We knew perfectly well of course that though it was bound
      to come to the light he would find considerable difficulty in
      endeavouring to try to induce himself to try to endeavour to
      ascertain the spiritual plenipotentiary and so we knew of
      course perfectly well—</p></p>
      <p class="textParagraph"> Murmuring faces waited and watched;  murmurous voices
      filled the dark shell of the cave. He feared intensely in spirit
      and in flesh but, raising his head bravely, he strode into the
      room firmly. A doorway, a room, the same room, same win-
      dow. He told himself calmly that those words had absolutely
      no sense which had seemed to rise murmurously from the dark.
      He told himself that it was simply his room with the door
      open.</p>
      <p class="textParagraph"> He closed the door and, walking swiftly to the bed, knelt
      beside it and covered his face with his hands. His hands were
      cold and damp and his limbs ached with chill. Bodily unrest
      and chill and weariness beset him, routing his thoughts. Why
      was he kneeling there like a child saying his evening prayers?
      To be alone with his soul, to examine his conscience, to meet
      his sins face to face, to recall their times and manners and
      circumstances, to weep over them. He could not weep. He
      could not summon them to his memory. He felt only an ache of
      soul and body, his whole being, memory, will, understanding,
      flesh, benumbed and weary.</p>
      <p class="textParagraph"> That was the work of devils, to scatter his thoughts and
      overcloud his conscience, assailing him at the gates of the cow-
      ardly and sincorrupted flesh: and, praying God timidly to
      forgive him his weakness, he crawled up on to the bed and,
      wrapping the blankets closely about him, covered his face again
      with his hands. He had  sinned. He had sinned so deeply against
      heaven and before God that he was not worthy to be called
      God's child.</p>
      <p class="textParagraph"> Could it be that he, Stephen Dedalus, had done those things?
      His conscience sighed in answer. Yes, he had done them, se-
      cretly, filthily, time after time, and, hardened in sinful impeni-
      tence, he had dared to wear the mask of holiness before the
      tabernacle itself while his soul within was a living mass of
      corruption. How came it that God had not struck him dead?
      The leprous company of his sins closed about him, breathing
      upon him, bending over him from all sides. He strove to forget
      them in an act of prayer, huddling his limbs closer  together and
      binding down his eyelids: but the senses of the soul would not
      be bound and, though his eyes were shut fast, he saw the places
      where he had sinned and, though his ears were tightly covered,
      he heard. He desired with all his will not to hear or see. He
      desired till his frame shook under the strain of his desire and
      until the senses of his soul closed. They closed for an instant
      and then opened. He saw.</p>
      <p class="textParagraph"> A field of stiff weeds and thistles and tufted nettlebunches.
      Thick among the tufts of rank stiff growth lay battered canis-
      ters and clots and coils of solid excrement. A faint marshlight
      struggled upwards from all the ordure through the bristling
      greygreen weeds. An evil smell, faint and foul as the light,
      curled upwards sluggishly out of the canisters and from the
      stale crusted dung.</p>
      <p class="textParagraph"> Creatures were in the field; one, three, six: creatures were
      moving in the field, hither and thither. Goatish creatures with
      human faces, hornybrowed, lightly bearded and grey as india-
      rubber. The malice of evil glittered in their hard eyes, as they
      moved hither and thither, trailing their long tails behind them.
      A rictus of cruel malignity lit up greyly their old bony faces.
      One was clasping about his ribs a torn flannel waistcoat, an-
      other complained monotonously as his beard stuck in the
      tufted weeds. Soft language issued from their spittleless lips as
      they swished in slow circles round and round the field, winding
      hither and thither through the weeds, dragging their long tails
      amid the rattling canisters. They moved in slow circles, circling
      closer and closer, to enclose, to  enclose, soft language issuing
      from their lips, their long swishing tails  besmeared with stale
      shite, thrusting upwards their terrific faces .....</p>
      <p class="textParagraph"> Help!</p>
      <p class="textParagraph"> He flung the blankets from him madly to free his face and
      neck. That was his hell. God had allowed him to see the hell
      reserved for his sins: stinking, bestial, malignant, a hell of lech-
      erous goatish fiends. For him! For him!</p>
      <p class="textParagraph"> He sprang from the bed, the reeking odour pouring down
      his throat, clogging and revolting his entrails. Air! The air of
      heaven! He stumbled towards the window, groaning and al-
      most fainting with sickness. At the washstand a convulsion
      seized him within: and, clasping his cold forehead wildly, he
      vomited profusely in agony.</p>
      <p class="textParagraph"> When the fit had spent itself he walked weakly to the win-
      dow and, lifting the sash, sat in a corner of the embrasure and
      leaned his elbow upon the sill. The rain had drawn off; and
      amid the moving vapours from point to point of light the city
      was spinning about herself a soft cocoon of yellowish haze.
      Heaven was still and faintly luminous and the air sweet to
      breathe, as in a thicket drenched with showers: and amid peace
      and shimmering lights and quiet fragrances he made a covenant
      with his heart.</p>
      <p class="textParagraph"> He prayed:
       <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>―<span class="emph">He once had meant to come on earth in heavenly glory but
      we sinned: and then He could not safely visit us but with a
      shrouded majesty and a bedimmed radiance for He was God.
      So He came Himself in weakness not in power and He sent
      thee, a creature in His stead, with a creature's comeliness and
      lustre suited to our state. And now thy very face and form, dear
      mother, speak to us of the Eternal; not like earthly beauty,
      dangerous to look upon, but like the morning star which is thy
      emblem, bright and musical, breathing purity, telling of heaven
      and infusing peace. O harbinger of day! O light of the pilgrim!
      Lead us still as thou hast led. In the dark night, across the bleak
      wilderness guide us on to our Lord Jesus, guide us home.</span></p></p>
      <p class="textParagraph">His eyes were dimmed with tears and, looking humbly up to
      heaven, he wept for the innocence he had lost.</p>
      <p class="textParagraph"> When evening had fallen he left the house and the first touch
      of the damp dark air and the noise of the door as it closed
      behind him made ache again his conscience, lulled by prayer
      and tears. Confess! Confess! It was not enough to lull the con-
      science with a tear and a prayer. He had to kneel before the
      minister of the Holy Ghost and tell over his hidden sins truly
      and repentantly. Before he heard again the footboard of the
      housedoor trail over the threshold  as it opened to let him in,
      before he saw again the table in the kitchen set for supper he
      would have knelt and confessed. It was quite simple.</p>
      <p class="textParagraph"> The ache of conscience ceased and he walked onward swiftly
      through the dark streets. There were so many flagstones on the
      footpath of that street and so many streets in that city and so
      many cities in the world. Yet eternity had no end. He was in
      mortal sin. Even once was a mortal sin. It could happen in an
      instant. But how so quickly? By seeing or by thinking of seeing.
      The eyes see the thing, without having wished first to see. Then
      in an instant it happens. But does that part of the body under-
      stand or what? The serpent, the most subtle beast of the field.
      It must understand when it desires in one instant and then
      prolongs its own desire instant after instant, sinfully. It feels
      and understands and desires. What a horrible thing! Who made
      it to be like that, a bestial part of the body able to understand
      bestially and desire bestially? Was that then he or an inhuman
      thing moved by a lower soul than his soul? His soul sickened at
      the thought of a torpid snaky life feeding itself out of the tender
      marrow of his life and fattening upon the slime of lust. O why
      was that so? O why?</p>
      <p class="textParagraph"> He cowered in the shadow of the thought, abasing himself in
      the awe of God  Who had made all things and all men. Mad-
      ness. Who could think such a thought? And, cowering in
      darkness and abject, he prayed mutely to his angel guardian to
      drive away with his sword the demon that was whispering to
      his brain.</p>
      <p class="textParagraph"> The whisper ceased and he knew then clearly that his own
      soul had sinned in thought and word and deed wilfully through
      his own body. Confess! He had to confess every sin. How could
      he utter in words to the priest what he had done? Must, must.
      Or how could he explain without dying of shame? Or how
      could he have done such things without shame? A madman, a
      loathsome madman! Confess! O he would indeed to be free and
      sinless again! Perhaps the priest would know. O dear God!</p>
      <p class="textParagraph"> He walked on and on through illlit  streets, fearing to stand
      still for a moment lest it might seem that he held back from
      what awaited him, fearing to arrive at that towards which he
      still turned with longing. How beautiful must be a soul in the
      state of grace when God looked upon it with love!</p>
      <p class="textParagraph"> Frowsy girls sat along the curbstones before their baskets.
      Their dank hair hung trailed  over their brows. They were not
      beautiful to see as they crouched in the mire. But their souls
      were seen by God; and if their souls were in a state of grace
      they were radiant to see: and God loved them, seeing them.</p>
      <p class="textParagraph"> A wasting breath of humiliation blew bleakly over his soul
      to think of how he had fallen, to feel that those souls were
      dearer to God than his. The wind blew over him and passed on
      to the myriads and myriads of other souls on whom God's
      favour shone now  more and now less, stars now brighter and
      now dimmer, sustained  and failing. And the glimmering souls
      passed away, sustained and failing, merged in a moving breath.
      One soul was lost; a tiny soul: his. It flickered once and went
      out, forgotten, lost. The end: black cold void waste.</p>
      <p class="textParagraph"> Consciousness of place came ebbing back to him slowly over
      a vast tract of time unlit, unfelt, unlived. The squalid scene
      composed itself around him; the common accents, the burning
      gasjets in the shops, odours of fish and spirits and wet sawdust,
      moving men and women. An old woman was about to cross
      the street, an oilcan in her hand. He bent down and asked her
      was there a chapel near.
      <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">an old woman</span>―A chapel, sir? Yes, sir. Church Street chapel.</p>
      <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>―Church?</p></p>
      <p class="textParagraph"> She shifted the can to her other hand and directed him: and,
      as she held out her reeking withered right hand under its fringe
      of shawl, he bent lower towards her, saddened and soothed by
      her voice.
       <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>―Thank you.</p>
      <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">an old woman</span>―You are quite  welcome, sir.</p></p>
      <p class="textParagraph"> The candles on the high altar had been extinguished but the
      fragrance of incense still floated down the dim nave. Bearded
      workmen with pious faces were guiding a canopy out through
      a sidedoor, the sacristan aiding them with quiet gestures and
      words. A few of the faithful still lingered, praying before one of
      the sidealtars or kneeling in the benches near the confessionals.
      He approached timidly and knelt at the last bench in the body,
      thankful for the peace and silence and fragrant shadow of the
      church. The board on which he knelt was narrow and worn
      and those who knelt near him were humble followers of Jesus.
      Jesus too had been born in poverty and had worked in the shop
      of a carpenter, cutting boards and planing them, and had first
      spoken of the kingdom of God to poor fishermen, teaching all
      men to be meek and humble of heart.</p>
      <p class="textParagraph"> He bowed his head upon his hands, bidding his heart be
      meek and humble that he might be like those who knelt beside
      him and his prayer as acceptable as theirs. He prayed beside
      them but it was hard. His soul was foul with sin and he dared
      not ask forgiveness with the simple trust of those whom Jesus,
      in the mysterious ways of God, had called first to His side, the
      carpenters, the fishermen, poor and simple people  following a
      lowly trade, handling and shaping the wood of trees, mending
      their nets with patience.</p>
      <p class="textParagraph"> A tall figure came down the aisle and the penitents stirred:
      and, at the last moment glancing up swiftly, he saw a long grey
      beard and the brown habit of a capuchin. The priest entered
      the box and was hidden. Two penitents rose and entered the
      confessional at either side. The wooden slide was drawn back
      and the faint murmur of a voice troubled the silence.</p>
      <p class="textParagraph"> His blood began to murmur in his veins, murmuring like a
      sinful city summoned from its sleep to hear its doom. Little
      flakes of fire fell and powdery ashes fell softly, alighting on the
      houses of men. They stirred, waking from sleep, troubled by
      the heated air.</p>
      <p class="textParagraph"> The slide was shot back. The penitent emerged from the side
      of the box. The farther slide was drawn. A woman entered
      quietly and deftly where the first penitent had knelt. The faint
      murmur began again.</p>
      <p class="textParagraph"> He could still leave the chapel. He could stand up, put one
      foot before the other and walk out softly and then run, run, run
      swiftly through the dark streets. He could still escape from the
      shame. O what shame! His face was burning with shame. Had
      it been any terrible crime but that one sin! Had it been murder!
      Little fiery flakes fell and touched him at all points, shameful
      thoughts, shameful words, shameful acts. Shame covered him
      wholly like fine glowing ashes falling continually. To say it in
      words! His soul, stifling and helpless, would cease to be.</p>
      <p class="textParagraph"> The slide was shot back. A penitent emerged from the far-
      ther side of the box. The near slide was drawn. A penitent
      entered where the other penitent had come out. A soft whisper-
      ing noise floated in vaporous cloudlets out of the box. It was
      the woman: soft whispering cloudlets, soft whispering vapour,
      whispering and vanishing.</p>
      <p class="textParagraph"> He beat his breast with his fist humbly, secretly under cover
      of the wooden armrest. He would be at one with others and
      with God. He would love his neighbour. He would love God
      Who had made and loved him. He would kneel and pray with
      others and be happy. God would look down on him and on
      them and would love them all.</p>
      <p class="textParagraph"> It was easy to be good. God's yoke was sweet and light. It
      was better never to have sinned, to have remained always a
      child, for God loved little children and suffered them to come
      to Him. It was a terrible and a sad thing to sin. But God was
      merciful to poor sinners who were truly sorry. How true that
      was! That was indeed goodness.</p>
      <p class="textParagraph"> The slide was shot to suddenly. The penitent came out. He
      was next. He stood up in terror and walked blindly into the
      box.</p>
      <p class="textParagraph"> At last it had come. He knelt in the silent gloom and raised
      his eyes to the white crucifix suspended above him. God could
      see that he was sorry. He would tell all his sins. His confession
      would be long, long. Everybody in the chapel would know then
      what a sinner he had been. Let them know. It was true. But
      God had promised to forgive him if he was sorry. He was
      sorry. He clasped his hands and raised them towards the white
      form, praying with his darkened eyes, praying with all his
      trembling body, swaying his head to and fro like a lost crea-
      ture, praying with whimpering lips.
       <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>―Sorry! Sorry! O sorry!</p></p>
      <p class="textParagraph"> The slide clicked back and his heart bounded in his breast.
      The face of an old priest was at the grating, averted from him,
      leaning upon a hand. He made the sign of the cross and prayed
      of the priest to bless him for he had sinned. Then, bowing his
      head, he repeated the Confiteor in fright. At the words <span class="emph">my</span>
      <span class="emph">most grievous fault</span> he ceased, breathless.
      <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Priest</span>―How long is it since your last confession, my child?</p>
      <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>―A long time, father.</p>
      <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Priest</span>―A month, my child?</p>
      <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>Longer, father.</p>
      <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Priest</span>Three months, my child?</p>
      <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>―Longer, father.</p>
      <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Priest</span>―Six months?</p>
      <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>―Eight months, father.</p></p>
      <p class="textParagraph"> He had begun. The priest asked:
      <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Priest</span>―And what do you remember since that time?</p></p>
      <p class="textParagraph"> He began to confess his sins: masses missed, prayers not
      said, lies.
      <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Priest</span>―Anything else, my child?</p></p>
      <p class="textParagraph"> Sins of anger, envy of  others, gluttony, vanity, disobedience.
      <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Priest</span>―Anything else, my child?</p>
      <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>―Sloth.</p>
      <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Priest</span>―Anything else, my child?</p></p>
      <p class="textParagraph"> There was no help. He murmured:
      <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>―I .... committed sins of impurity, father.</p></p>
      <p class="textParagraph"> The priest did not turn his head.
      <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Priest</span>―With yourself, my child?</p>
      <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>―And ... with others.</p>
      <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Priest</span>―With women, my child?</p>
      <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>―Yes, father.</p>
      <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Priest</span>Were they married women, my child?</p></p>
      <p class="textParagraph">He did not know. His sins trickled from his lips, one by one,
      trickled in shameful drops from his soul festering and oozing
      like a sore, a squalid stream of vice. The last sins oozed forth,
      sluggish, filthy. There was no more to tell. He bowed his head,
      overcome.</p>
      <p class="textParagraph"> The priest was silent. Then he asked:
      <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Priest</span>―How old are you, my child?</p>
      <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>―Sixteen, father.</p></p>
      The priest passed his hand several times over his face. Then,
      resting his forehead against his hand, he leaned towards the
      grating and, with eyes still averted, spoke slowly. His voice was
      weary and old.
      <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Priest</span>―You are very young, my child, he said, and let me implore of
      you to give up that sin. It is a terrible sin. It kills the body and
      it kills the soul. It is the cause of many crimes and misfortunes.
      Give it up, my child, for God' sake. It is dishonourable and
      unmanly. You cannot know where that wretched habit will
      lead you or where it will come against you. As long as you
      commit that sin, my poor child, you will never be worth one
      farthing to God. Pray to our mother Mary to help you. She will
      help you, my child. Pray to Our Blessed Lady when that sin
      comes into  your mind. I am sure you will do that, will you not?
      You repent of all those sins. I am sure you do. And you will
      promise God now that by His holy grace you will never offend
      Him any more by that wicked sin. You will make that solemn
      promise to God, will you not?</p>
      <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>―Yes, father.</p>
      <p class="textParagraph">The old and weary voice fell like sweet rain upon his quak-
      ing parching heart. How sweet and sad!
      <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Priest</span>―Do so, my poor child. The devil has  led you astray. Drive
      him back to hell when he tempts you to dishonour your body
      in that way - the foul spirit who hates Our Lord. Promise God
      now that you will give up that sin, that wretched wretched sin.</p></p>
      <p class="textParagraph">Blinded by his tears and by the light of God's mercifulness
      he bent his head and heard the grave words of absolution
      spoken and saw the priest's hand raised above him in token of
      forgiveness.
      <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Priest</span>―God bless you, my child. Pray for me.</p></p>
      <p class="textParagraph">He knelt to say his penance, praying in a corner of the dark
      nave: and his prayers ascended to heaven from his purified
      heart like perfume streaming upwards from a heart of white
      rose.</p>
      <p class="textParagraph"> The  muddy streets were gay. He strode homeward, con-
      scious of an  invisible grace pervading and making light his
      limbs. In spite of all he had done it. He had confessed and God
      had pardoned him. His soul was made fair and holy once more,
      holy and happy.</p>
      <p class="textParagraph"> It would be beautiful to die if God so willed. It was beautiful
      to live if God so willed, to live in grace a life of peace and
      virtue and forbearance with others.</p>
      <p class="textParagraph"> He sat by the fire in the kitchen, not daring to speak for
      happiness. Till that moment he had not known how beautiful
      and peaceful life could be. The green square of paper pinned
      round the lamp cast down a tender shade. On the dresser was a
      plate of sausages and white pudding and on the shelf there were
      eggs. They would be for the breakfast in the morning after the
      communion in the college chapel. White pudding and eggs and
      sausages and cups of tea. How simple and beautiful was life
      after all! And life lay all before him.</p>
      <p class="textParagraph"> In a dream he fell asleep. In a dream he rose and saw that it
      was morning. In a waking dream he went through the quiet
      morning towards the college.</p>
      <p class="textParagraph"> The boys were all there, kneeling in their places. He knelt
      among them, happy and shy. The altar was heaped with fra-
      grant masses of white flowers: and in the morning light the pale
      flames of the candles among the white flowers were clear and
      silent as his own soul.</p>
      <p class="textParagraph"> He knelt before the altar with his classmates, holding the
      altar cloth with them over a living rail of hands. His hands
      were trembling: and his soul trembled as he heard the priest
      pass with the ciborium from communicant to communicant.
      <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Priest</span>―Corpus Domini nostri.</p></p>
      <p class="textParagraph"> Could it be? He knelt there sinless and timid: and he would
      hold upon his tongue the host and God would enter his purified
      body.
      <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Priest</span>―In vitam eternam. Amen.</p></p>
      <p class="textParagraph"> Another life! A life of grace and virtue and happiness! It was
      true. It was not a dream from which he would wake.  The past
      was past.
      <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Priest</span>―Corpus Domini nostri.</p></p>
      <p class="textParagraph"> The ciborium had come to him.</p>
    
  

  

	

		<h2 class="heading">IV<br>
</h2>

		<p class="textParagraph">Sunday was dedicated to the mystery of the Holy 
			Trinity, Monday to the Holy Ghost, Tuesday to the 
			Guardian Angels, Wednesday to Saint Joseph, Thursday to 
			the Most Blessed Sacrament of the Altar, Friday to the 
			Suffering Jesus, Saturday to the Blessed Virgin Mary. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Every morning he hallowed himself anew in the presence of 
			some holy image or mystery. His day began with an heroic 
			offering of its every moment of thought or action for the 
			intentions of the sovereign pontiff and with an early mass. The 
			raw morning air whetted his resolute piety; and often as he 
			knelt among the few worshippers at the sidealtar, following 
			with his interleaved prayerbook the murmur of the priest, he 
			glanced up for an instant towards the vested figure standing in 
			the gloom between the two candles which were the old and the 
			new testaments and imagined that he was kneeling at mass in 
			the catacombs. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">His daily life was laid out in devotional areas. By means of 
			ejaculations and prayers he stored up ungrudgingly for the 
			souls in purgatory centuries of days and quarantines and 
			years; yet the spiritual triumph which he felt in achieving with 
			ease so many fabulous ages of canonical penances did not 
			wholly reward his zeal of prayer since he could never know 
			how much temporal punishment he had remitted by way of 
			suffrage for the agonising souls: and, fearful lest in the midst 
			of the purgatorial fire, which differed from the infernal only in 
			that it was not everlasting, his penance might avail no more 
			than a drop of moisture, he drove his soul daily through an 
			increasing circle of works of supererogation. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Every part of his day, divided by what he regarded now as 
			the duties of his station in life, circled about its own centre of 
			spiritual energy. His life seemed to have drawn near to eternity; 
			every thought, word and deed, every instance of consciousness 
			could be made to revibrate radiantly in heaven: 
			and at times his sense of such immediate repercussion was so 
			lively that he seemed to feel his soul in devotion pressing like 
			fingers the keyboard of a great cash register and to see the 
			amount of his purchase start forth immediately in heaven, not 
			as a number but as a frail column of incense or as a slender 
			flower. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">The rosaries too which he said constantly - for he carried 
			his beads loose in his trousers' pockets that he might tell them 
			as he walked the streets - transformed themselves into coronals 
			of flowers of such vague unearthly texture that they 
			seemed to him as hueless and odourless as they were nameless. 
			He offered up each of his three daily chaplets that his 
			soul might grow strong in each of the three theological virtues, 
			in faith in the Father, Who had created him, in hope in the 
			Son Who had redeemed him, and in love of the Holy Ghost 
			Who had sanctified him, and this thrice triple prayer he offered 
			to the Three persons through Mary in the name of her 
			joyful and sorrowful and glorious  mysteries. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">On each of the seven days of the week he further prayed 
			that one of the seven gifts of the Holy Ghost might descend 
			upon his soul and drive out of it day by day the seven deadly 
			sins which had defiled it in the past; and he prayed for each 
			gift on its appointed day, confident that it would descend upon 
			him, though it seemed strange to him at times that wisdom 
			and understanding and knowledge were so distinct in their 
			nature that each should be prayed for apart from the others. 
			Yet he believed that at some future stage of his spiritual 
			progress this difficulty would be removed when his sinful soul 
			had been raised up from its weakness and enlightened by the 
			Third Person of the Most Blessed Trinity. He believed this all 
			the more, and with trepidation, because of the divine gloom 
			and silence wherein dwelt the unseen Paraclete, Whose symbols 
			were a dove and a mighty wind, to sin against Whom was 
			a sin beyond forgiveness, the eternal, mysterious secret Being 
			to Whom, as God, the priests offered up mass once a year, 
			robed in the scarlet of the tongues of fire. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">The imagery through which the nature and kinship of the 
			Three Persons of the Trinity were darkly shadowed forth in 
			the books of devotion which he read - the Father contemplating 
			from all eternity as in a mirror His Divine Perfections and 
			thereby begetting eternally the Eternal Son and the Holy Spirit 
			proceeding out of Father and Son from all eternity - were 
			easier of acceptance by his mind by reason of their august 
			incomprehensibility than was the simple fact that God had 
			loved his soul from all eternity, for ages before he had been 
			born into the world, for ages before the world itself had existed. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">He had heard the names of the passions of love and hate 
			pronounced solemnly on the stage and in the pulpit, had found 
			them set forth solemnly in books, and had wondered why his 
			soul was unable to harbour them for any time or to force his 
			lips to utter their names with conviction. A brief anger had 
			often invested him but he had never been able to make it an 
			abiding passion and had always felt himself passing out of it as 
			if his very body were being divested with ease of some outer 
			skin or peel. He had felt a subtle, dark and murmurous presence 
			penetrate his being and fire him with a brief iniquitous 
			lust: it too had slipped beyond his grasp leaving his mind lucid 
			and indifferent. This, it seemed, was the only love and that the 
			only hate his soul would harbour. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">But he could no longer disbelieve in the reality of love since 
			God Himself had loved his individual soul with divine love 
			from all eternity. Gradually, as his soul was enriched with 
			spiritual knowledge, he saw the whole world forming one vast 
			symmetrical expression of God's power and love. Life became 
			a divine gift for every moment and sensation of which, were it 
			even the sight of a single leaf hanging on the twig of a tree, his 
			soul should praise and thank the Giver. The world for all its 
			solid substance and complexity no longer existed for his soul 
			save as a theorem of divine power and love and universality. 
			So entire and unquestionable was this sense of the divine 
			meaning in all nature granted to his soul that he could scarcely 
			understand why it was in any way necessary that he should 
			continue to live. Yet that was part of the divine purpose and 
			he dared not question its use, he above all others who had 
			sinned so deeply and so foully against the divine purpose. 
			Meek and abased by this consciousness of the one eternal 
			omnipresent perfect reality his soul took up again her burden 
			of pieties, masses and prayers and sacraments and mortifications, 
			and only then for the first time since he had 
			brooded on the great mystery of love did he feel within him a 
			warm movement like that of some newly born life or virtue of 
			the soul itself. The attitude of rapture in sacred art, the raised 
			and parted hands, the parted lips and eyes as of one about to 
			swoon, became for him an image of the soul in prayer, humiliated 
			and faint before her Creator. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">But he had been forewarned of the dangers of spiritual 
			exaltation and did not allow himself to desist from even the 
			least or lowliest devotion,  striving also by constant mortification 
			to undo the sinful past rather than to achieve a 
			saintliness fraught with peril. Each of his senses was brought 
			under a rigorous discipline. In order to mortify the sense of 
			sight he made it his rule to walk in the street with downcast 
			eyes, glancing neither to right nor left and never behind him. 
			His eyes shunned every encounter with the eyes of women. 
			From time to time also he balked them by a sudden effort of 
			the will, as by lifting them suddenly in the middle of an 
			unfinished sentence and closing the book. To mortify his 
			hearing he exerted no control over his voice which was then 
			breaking, neither sang nor whistled and made no attempt to 
			flee from noises which caused him painful nervous irritation 
			such as the sharpening of knives on the knifeboard, the 
			gathering of cinders on the fireshovel and the twigging of the 
			carpet. To mortify his smell was more difficult as he found in 
			himself no instinctive repugnance to bad odours, whether they 
			were the odours of the outdoor world such as those of dung 
			and tar or the odours of his own person among which he had 
			made many curious comparisons and experiments. He found 
			in the end that the only odour against which his sense of smell 
			revolted was a certain stale fishy stink like that of longstanding 
			urine: and whenever it was possible he subjected himself to 
			this unpleasant odour. To mortify the taste he practised strict 
			habits at table, observed to the letter all the fasts of the church 
			and sought by distraction to divert his mind from the savours 
			of different foods. But it was to the mortification of touch that 
			he brought the most assiduous ingenuity of inventiveness. He 
			never consciously changed his position in bed, sat in the most 
			uncomfortable positions, suffered patiently every itch and 
			pain, kept away from the fire, remained on his knees all 
			through the mass except at the gospels, left parts of his neck 
			and face undried so that air might sting them and, whenever 
			he was not saying his beads, carried his arms stiffly at his 
			sides like a runner and never in his pockets or clasped behind 
			him. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">He had no temptations to sin mortally. It surprised him 
			however to find that at the end of his course of intricate piety 
			and selfrestraint he was so easily at the mercy of childish and 
			unworthy imperfections. His prayers and fasts availed him 
			little for the suppression of anger at hearing his mother sneeze 
			or at being disturbed in his devotions. It needed an immense 
			effort of his will to master the impulse which urged him to give 
			outlet to such irritation. Images of the outbursts of trivial 
			anger which he had often noted among his masters, their 
			twitching mouths, closeshut lips and flushed cheeks, recurred 
			to his memory, discouraging him, for all his practice of humility, 
			by the comparison. To merge his life in the common tide 
			of other lives was harder for him than any fasting or prayer, 
			and it was his constant failure to do this to his own satisfaction 
			which caused in his soul at last a sensation of spiritual dryness 
			together with a growth of doubts and  scruples. His soul traversed 
			a period of desolation in which the sacraments themselves 
			seemed to have turned into dried up sources. His 
			confession became a channel for the escape of scrupulous and 
			unrepented imperfections. His actual reception of the eucharist 
			did not bring him the same dissolving moments of 
			virginal selfsurrender as did those spiritual communions made 
			by him sometimes at the close of some visit to the Blessed 
			Sacrament. The book which he used for these visits was an old 
			neglected book written by saint Alphonsus Liguori, with 
			fading characters and sere foxpapered leaves. A faded world 
			of fervent love and virginal responses seemed to be evoked for 
			his soul by the reading of its pages in which the imagery of the 
			canticles was interwoven with the communicant's prayers. An 
			inaudible voice seemed to caress the soul, telling her names 
			and glories, bidding her arise as for espousal and come away, 
			bidding her look forth, a spouse, from Amana and from the 
			mountains of the leopards; and the soul seemed to answer 
			with the same inaudible voice, surrendering herself: Inter 
				ubera mea commorabitur. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">This idea of surrender had a perilous attraction for his mind 
			now that he felt his soul beset once again by the insistent 
			voices of the flesh which began to murmur to him again during 
			his prayers and meditations. It gave him an intense sense of 
			power to know that he  could by a single act of consent, in a 
			moment of thought, undo all that he had done. He seemed to 
			feel a flood slowly advancing towards his naked feet and to be 
			waiting for the first faint timid noiseless wavelet to touch his 
			fevered skin. Then, almost at the instant of that touch, almost 
			at the verge of sinful consent, he found himself standing far 
			away from the flood upon a dry shore, saved by a sudden act 
			of the will or a sudden ejaculation: and, seeing the silver line 
			of the flood far away and beginning again its slow advance 
			towards his feet, a new thrill of power and satisfaction shook 
			his soul to know that he had not yielded nor undone all. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">When he had eluded the flood of temptation many times in 
			this way he grew troubled and wondered whether the grace 
			which he had refused to lose was not being filched from him 
			little by little. The clear certitude of his own immunity grew 
			dim and to it succeeded a vague fear that his soul had really 
			fallen unawares. It was with difficulty that he won back his old 
			consciousness of his state of grace by telling himself that he 
			had prayed to God at every temptation and that the grace 
			which he had prayed for must have been given to him inasmuch 
			as God was obliged to give it. The very frequency and 
			violence of temptations showed him at last the truth of what 
			he had heard about the trials of the saints. Frequent and 
			violent temptations were a proof that the citadel of the soul 
			had not fallen and that the devil raged to make it fall. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Often when he had confessed his doubts and scruples, some 
			momentary inattention at prayer, a movement of trivial anger 
			in his soul or a subtle wilfulness in speech or act, he was 
			bidden by his confessor to name some sin of his past life 
			before absolution was given him. He named it with humility 
			and shame and repented of it once more. It humiliated and 
			shamed him to think that he would never be freed from it 
			wholly, however holily he might live or whatever virtues or 
			perfections he might attain. A restless feeling of guilt would 
			always be present with him: he would confess and repent and 
			be absolved, confess and repent again and be absolved again, 
			fruitlessly. Perhaps that first hasty confession wrung from him 
			by the fear of hell had not been good? Perhaps, concerned 
			only for his imminent doom, he had not had sincere sorrow 
			for his sin? But the surest sign that his confession had been 
			good and that he had had sincere sorrow for his sin was, he 
			knew, the amendment of his life. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—I have amended  my life, have I not? he asked himself. </p>

		

	  

	 

		<p class="textParagraph">The director stood in the embrasure of the window, his 
			back to the light, leaning an elbow on the brown crossblind 
			and, as he spoke and smiled, slowly dangling and looping the 
			cord of the other blind. Stephen stood before him, following 
			for a moment with his eyes the waning of the long summer 
			daylight above the roofs or the slow deft movements of the 
			priestly fingers. The priest's face was in total shadow but the 
			waning daylight from behind him touched the deeply grooved 
			temples and the curves of the skull. Stephen followed also 
			with his ears the accents and intervals of the priest's voice as 
			he spoke gravely and cordially of indifferent themes, the 
			vacation which had just ended, the colleges of the order 
			abroad, the transference of masters. The grave and cordial 
			voice went on easily with its tale, and in the pauses Stephen 
			felt bound to set it on again with respectful questions. He knew 
			that the tale was a prelude and his mind waited for the sequel. 
			Ever since the message of summons had come for him from 
			the director his mind had struggled to find the meaning of the 
			message; and during the long restless time he had sat in the 
			college parlour waiting for the director to come in his eyes had 
			wandered from one sober picture to another around the walls 
			and his mind wandered from one guess to another until the 
			meaning of the summons had almost become clear. Then, just 
			as he was wishing that some unforeseen cause might prevent 
			the director from coming, he had heard the handle of the door 
			turning and the swish of a soutane. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">The director had begun to speak of the dominican and 
			franciscan orders and of the friendship between saint Thomas 
			and saint Bonaventure. The capuchin dress, he thought, was 
			rather too  ... </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Stephen's face gave back the priest's indulgent smile and, not 
			being anxious to give an opinion, he made a slight dubitative 
			movement with his lips. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—I believe, continued the director, that there is some talk 
			now among the capuchins themselves of doing away with it 
			and following the example of the other franciscans. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—I suppose they would retain it in the cloister, said Stephen. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—O, certainly, said the director. For the cloister it is all 
			right but for the street I really think it would be better to do 
			away with, don't you? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—It must be troublesome, I imagine? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Of course it is, of course. Just imagine when I was in 
			Belgium I used to see them out cycling in all kinds of weather 
			with this thing up about their knees! It was really ridiculous. 
			Les jupes, they call them in Belgium. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">The vowel was so modified as to be indistinct. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—What do they call them? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Les jupes. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—O. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Stephen smiled again in answer to the smile which he could 
			not see on the priest's shadowed face, its image or spectre only 
			passing rapidly across his mind as the low discreet accent fell 
			upon his ear. He gazed calmly before him at the waning sky, 
			glad of the cool of the evening and the faint yellow glow which 
			hid the tiny flame kindling upon his cheek. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">The names of articles of dress worn by women or of certain 
			soft and delicate stuffs used in their making brought always to 
			his mind a delicate and sinful perfume. As a boy he had imagined 
			the reins by which horses are driven as slender silken 
			bands and it shocked him to feel at <span class="hide">53.293003 -6.168866</span>Stradbrook the greasy 
			leather of harness. It had shocked him too when he had felt 
			for the first time beneath his tremulous fingers the brittle 
			texture of a woman's stocking for, retaining nothing of all he 
			read save that which seemed to him an echo or a prophecy of 
			his own state, it was only amid softworded phrases or within 
			rosesoft stuffs that he dared to conceive of the soul or body of 
			a woman moving with tender life. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">But the phrase on the priest's lips was disingenuous for he 
			knew that a priest should not speak lightly on that theme. The 
			phrase had been spoken lightly with design and he felt that his 
			face was being searched by the eyes in the shadow. Whatever 
			he had heard or read of the craft of jesuits he had put aside 
			frankly as not borne out by his own experience. His masters, 
			even when they had not attracted him, had seemed to him 
			always intelligent and serious priests, athletic and highspirited 
			prefects. He thought of them as men who washed their bodies 
			briskly with cold water and wore clean cold linen. During all 
			the years he had lived among them in <span class="hide">53.310601 -6.695541</span>Clongowes and in 
			<span class="hide">52.207800 -8.211070</span>Belvedere he had received only two pandies and, though these 
			had been dealt him in the wrong, he knew that he had often 
			escaped punishment. During all those years he had never 
			heard from any of his masters a flippant word: it was they 
			who had taught him christian doctrine and urged him to live a 
			good life and, when he had fallen into grievous sin, it was they 
			who had led him back to grace. Their presence had made him 
			diffident of himself when he was a muff in Clongowes and it 
			had made him diffident of himself also while he had held his 
			equivocal position in Belvedere. A constant sense of this had 
			remained with him up to the last year of his school life. He 
			had never once disobeyed or allowed turbulent companions to 
			seduce him from his habit of quiet obedience: and, even when 
			he doubted some statement of a master, he had never presumed 
			to doubt openly. Lately some of their judgments had 
			sounded a little childish in his ears and had made him feel a 
			regret and pity as though he were slowly passing out of an 
			accustomed world and were hearing its language for the last 
			time. One day when some boys had gathered round a priest 
			under the shed near the chapel, he had heard the priest say: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—I believe that Lord Macaulay was a man who probably 
			never committed a mortal sin in his life, that is to say, a 
			deliberate mortal sin. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Some of the boys had then asked the priest if Victor Hugo 
			were not the greatest French writer. The priest had answered 
			that Victor Hugo had never written half so well when he had 
			turned against the church as he had written when he was a 
			catholic. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—But there are many eminent French critics, said the 
			priest, who consider that even Victor Hugo, great as he certainly 
			was, had not so pure a French style as Louis Veuillot. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">The tiny flame which the priest's allusion had kindled upon 
			Stephen's cheek had sunk down again and his eyes were still 
			fixed calmly on the colorless sky. But an unresting doubt flew 
			hither and thither before his mind. Masked memories passed 
			quickly before him: he recognised scenes and persons yet he 
			was conscious that he had failed to perceive some vital circumstance 
			in them. He saw himself walking about the grounds 
			watching the sports in <span class="hide">53.348746 -6.275034</span>Clongowes and eating slim jim out of 
			his cricketcap. Some jesuits were walking round the cycletrack 
			in the company of ladies. The echoes of certain expressions 
			used in <span class="hide">53.348746 -6.275034</span>Clongowes sounded in remote caves of his mind. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">His ears were listening to these distant echoes amid the 
			silence of the parlour when he became aware that the priest 
			was addressing him in a different voice. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—I sent for you today, Stephen, because I wished to speak 
			to you on a very important subject. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Yes, sir. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Have you ever felt that you had a vocation? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Stephen parted his lips to answer yes and then withheld the 
			word suddenly. The priest waited for the answer and added: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—I mean have you ever felt within yourself, in your soul, a 
			desire to join the order. Think. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—I have sometimes thought of it, said Stephen. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">The priest let the blindcord fall to one side and, uniting his 
			hands, leaned his chin gravely upon them, communing with 
			himself. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—In a college like this, he said at length, there is one boy or 
			perhaps two or three boys whom God calls to the religious 
			life. Such a boy is marked off from his companions by his 
			piety, by the good example he shows to others. He is looked 
			up to by them; he is chosen perhaps as prefect by his fellow 
			sodalists. And you, Stephen, have been such a boy in this 
			college, prefect of Our Blessed Lady's sodality. Perhaps you 
			are the boy in this college whom God designs to call to Himself. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">A strong note of pride reinforcing the gravity of the priest's 
			voice made Stephen's heart quicken in response. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—To receive that call, Stephen, said the priest, is the greatest 
			honour that the Almighty God can bestow upon a man. 
			No king or emperor on this earth has the power of the priest of 
			God. No angel or archangel in heaven, no saint, not even the 
			Blessed Virgin herself has the power of a priest of God: the 
			power of the keys, the power to bind and to loose from sin, 
			the power of exorcism, the power to cast out from the creatures 
			of God the evil spirits that have power over them, the 
			power, the authority, to make the great God of Heaven come 
			down upon the altar and take the form of bread and wine. 
			What an awful power, Stephen! </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">A flame began to flutter again on Stephen's cheek as he 
			heard in this proud address an echo of his own proud musings. 
			How often had he seen himself as a priest wielding calmly and 
			humbly the awful power of which angels and saints stood in 
			reverence! His soul had loved to muse in secret on this desire. 
			He had seen himself, a young and silentmannered priest, 
			entering a confessional swiftly, ascending the altarsteps, 
			incensing, genuflecting, accomplishing the vague acts of the 
			priesthood which pleased him by reason of their semblance of 
			reality and of their distance from it. In that dim life which he 
			had lived through in his musings he had assumed the voices 
			and gestures which he had noted with various priests. He had 
			bent his knee sideways like such a one, he had shaken the 
			thurible only slightly like such a one, his chasuble had swung 
			open like that of such another as he had turned to the altar 
			again after having blessed the people. And above all it had 
			pleased him to fill the second place in those dim scenes of his 
			imagining. He shrank from the dignity of celebrant because it 
			displeased him to imagine that all the vague pomp should end 
			in his own person or that the ritual should assign to him so 
			clear and final an office. He longed for the minor sacred 
			offices, to be vested with the tunicle of subdeacon at high 
			mass, to stand aloof from the altar, forgotten by the people, 
			his shoulders covered with a humeral veil, holding the paten 
			within its folds, or, when the sacrifice had  been accomplished, 
			to stand as deacon in a dalmatic of cloth of gold on the step 
			below the celebrant, his hands joined and his face towards the 
			people, and sing the chant Ite, missa est. If ever he had seen 
			himself celebrant it was as in the pictures of the mass in his 
			child's massbook, in a church without worshippers, save for 
			the angel of the sacrifice, at a bare altar and served by an 
			acolyte scarcely more boyish than himself. In vague sacrificial 
			or sacramental acts alone his will seemed drawn to go forth to 
			encounter reality: and it was partly the absence of an appointed 
			rite which had always constrained him to inaction 
			whether he had allowed silence to cover his anger or pride or 
			had suffered only an embrace he longed to give. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">He listened in reverent silence now to the priest's appeal 
			and through the words he heard even more distinctly a voice 
			bidding him approach, offering him secret knowledge and 
			secret power. He would know then what was the sin  of Simon 
			Magus and what the sin against the Holy Ghost for which 
			there was no forgiveness. He would know obscure things, 
			hidden from others, from those who  were conceived and born 
			children of wrath. He would know the sins, the sinful longings 
			and sinful thoughts and sinful acts, of others, hearing them 
			murmured into his ears in the confessional under the shame of 
			a darkened chapel by the lips of women and of girls: but 
			rendered immune mysteriously at his ordination by the imposition 
			of hands his soul would pass again uncontaminated to 
			the white peace of the altar. No touch of sin would linger upon 
			the hands with which he would elevate and break the host; no 
			touch of sin would linger on his lips in prayer to make him eat 
			and drink damnation to himself, not discerning the body of the 
			Lord. He would hold his secret knowledge and secret power, 
			being as sinless as the innocent: and he would be a priest for 
			ever according to the order of Melchisedec. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—I will offer up my mass tomorrow morning, said the 
			director, that Almighty God may reveal to you His holy will. 
			And let you, Stephen, make a novena to your holy patron 
			saint, the first martyr, who is very powerful with God, that 
			God may enlighten your mind. But you must be quite sure, 
			Stephen, that you have a vocation because it would be terrible 
			if you found afterwards that you had none. Once a priest 
			always a priest, remember. Your catechism tells you that the 
			sacrament of Holy Orders is one of those which can be received 
			only once because it imprints on the soul an indelible 
			spiritual mark which can never be effaced. It is before you 
			must weigh well, not after. It is a solemn question, Stephen, 
			because on it may depend the salvation of your eternal soul. 
			But we will pray to God together. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">He held open the heavy hall door and gave his hand as if 
			already to a companion in the spiritual life. Stephen passed 
			out on to  the wide platform above the steps and was conscious 
			of the caress of mild evening air. Towards <span class="hide">53.354445 -6.263812</span>Findlater's church a 
			quartet of young men were striding along with linked arms, 
			swaying their heads and stepping to the agile melody of their 
			leader's concertina. The music passed in an instant, as the first 
			bars of sudden music always did, over the fantastic fabrics of 
			his mind, dissolving them painlessly and noiselessly as a 
			sudden wave dissolves the sandbuilt turrets of children. Smiling 
			at the trivial air he raised his eyes to the priest's face and, 
			seeing in it a mirthless reflection of the sunken day, detached 
			his hand slowly which had acquiesced  faintly in that companionship. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">As he descended the steps the impression which effaced his 
			troubled selfcommunion was that of a mirthless mask 
			reflecting a sunken day from the threshold of the college. The 
			shadow, then, of the life of the college passed gravely over his 
			consciousness. It was a grave and ordered and passionless life 
			that awaited him, a life without material cares. He wondered 
			how he would pass the first night in the novitiate and with 
			what dismay he would wake the first morning in the dormitory. 
			The troubling odour of the long corridors of <span class="hide">53.348746 -6.275034</span>Clongowes 
			came back to him and he heard the discreet murmur of the 
			burning gasflames. At once from every part of his being unrest 
			began to irradiate. A feverish quickening of his pulses followed 
			and a din of meaningless words drove his reasoned 
			thoughts hither and thither confusedly. His lungs dilated and 
			sank as if he were inhaling a warm moist unsustaining air and 
			he smelt again the warm moist air which hung in the bath in 
			<span class="hide">53.348746 -6.275034</span>Clongowes above the sluggish turfcoloured water. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Some instinct, waking at these memories, stronger than 
			education or piety, quickened within him at every near approach 
			to that life, an instinct subtle and hostile, and armed 
			him against acquiescence. The chill and order of the life 
			repelled him. He saw himself rising in the cold of the morning 
			and filing down with the others to early mass and trying vainly 
			to struggle with his prayers against the fainting sickness of his 
			stomach. He saw himself sitting at dinner with the community 
			of a college. What, then, had become of that deeprooted 
			shyness of his which had made him loth to eat or drink under 
			a strange roof? What had come of the pride of his spirit which 
			had always made him conceive himself as a being apart in every 
			order? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">The Reverend Stephen Dedalus, S.J. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">His name in that new life leaped into characters before his 
			eyes and to it there followed a mental sensation of an 
			undefined face or colour of a face. The colour faded and 
			became strong like a changing glow of pallid brick red. Was it 
			the raw reddish glow he had so often seen on wintry mornings 
			on the shaven gills of the priests? The face was eyeless and 
			sourfavoured and devout, shot with pink tinges of suffocated 
			anger. Was it not a mental spectre of the face of one of the 
			jesuits whom some of the boys called Lantern Jaws and others 
			Foxy Campbell? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">He was passing at that moment before the <span class="hide">53.358000 -6.259655</span>jesuit house in 
			Gardiner Street, and wondered vaguely which window would 
			be his if he ever joined the order. Then he wondered at the 
			vagueness of his wonder, at the remoteness of his soul from 
			what he had hitherto imagined her sanctuary, at the frail hold 
			which so many years of order and obedience had of him when 
			once a definite and irrevocable act of his threatened to end for 
			ever, in time and in eternity, his freedom. The voice of the 
			director urging upon him the proud claims of the church and 
			the mystery and power of the priestly office repeated itself 
			idly in his memory. His soul was not there to hear and greet it 
			and he knew now that the exhortation he had listened to had 
			already fallen into an idle formal tale. He would never swing 
			the thurible  before the tabernacle as priest. His destiny was to 
			be elusive of social or religious orders. The wisdom of the 
			priest's appeal did not touch him to the quick. He was destined 
			to learn his own wisdom apart from others or to learn 
			the wisdom of others himself wandering among the snares of 
			the world. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">The snares of the world were its ways of sin. He would fall. 
			He had not yet fallen but he would fall silently, in an instant. 
			Not to fall was too hard, too hard: and he felt the silent lapse 
			of his soul, as it would be at some instant to come, falling, 
			falling but not yet fallen, still unfallen but about to fall. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">He crossed the bridge over the stream of the <span class="hide"> 53.361845 -6.242480</span>Tolka and 
			turned his eyes coldly for an instant towards the faded blue 
			shrine of the Blessed Virgin which stood fowlwise on a pole in 
			the middle of a hamshaped encampment of poor cottages. 
			Then, bending to the left, he followed the lane which led up to 
			his house. The faint sour stink of rotted cabbages came towards 
			him from the kitchengardens on the rising ground 
			above the river. He smiled to think that it was this disorder, 
			the misrule and confusion of his father's house and the stagnation 
			of vegetable life, which was to win the day in his soul. 
			Then a short laugh broke from his lips as he thought of that 
			solitary farmhand in the kitchengardens behind their house 
			whom they had nicknamed the man with the hat. A second 
			laugh, taking rise from the first after a pause, broke from him 
			involuntarily as he thought of how the man with the hat 
			worked, considering in turn the four points of the sky and then 
			regretfully plunging his spade in the earth. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">He pushed open the latchless door of the porch and passed 
			through the naked hallway into the kitchen. A group of his 
			brothers and sisters was sitting round the table. Tea was 
			nearly over and only the last of the second watered tea remained 
			in the bottoms of the small glassjars and jampots 
			which did service for teacups. Discarded crusts and lumps of 
			sugared bread, turned brown by the tea which had been 
			poured over them, lay scattered on the table. Little wells of 
			tea lay here and there on the board and a knife with a broken 
			ivory handle was stuck through the pith of a ravaged turnover. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">The sad quiet greyblue glow of the dying day came through 
			the window and the open door, covering over and allaying 
			quietly a sudden instinct of remorse in Stephen's heart. All 
			that had been denied them had been freely given to him, the 
			eldest: but the quiet glow of evening showed him in their faces 
			no sign of rancour. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">He sat near them at the table and asked where his father 
			and mother were. One answered: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Goneboro toboro lookboro atboro aboro houseboro. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Still another removal! A boy named Fallon in Belvedere 
			had often asked him with a silly laugh why they moved so 
			often. A frown of scorn darkened quickly his forehead as he 
			heard again the silly laugh of the questioner. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">He asked: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Why are we on the move again, if it's a fair question? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">The same sister answered: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Becauseboro theboro landboro lordboro willboro putboro 
			usboro outboro. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">The voice of his youngest brother from the farther side of 
			the fireplace began to sing the air <span class="emph">Oft in the Stilly Night</span>. One 
			by one the others took up the air until a full choir of voices 
			was singing. They would sing so for hours, melody after 
			melody, glee after glee, till the last pale light died down on the 
			horizon, till the first dark nightclouds came forth and night 
			fell. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">He waited for some moments, listening, before he too took 
			up the air with them. He was listening with pain of spirit to the 
			overtone of weariness behind their frail fresh innocent voices. 
			Even before they set out on life's journey they seemed weary 
			already of the way. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">He heard the choir of voices in the kitchen echoed and 
			multiplied through an endless reverberation of the choirs of 
			endless generations of children: and heard in all the echoes an 
			echo also of the recurring note of weariness and pain. All 
			seemed weary of life even before entering upon it. And he 
			remembered that Newman had heard this note also in the 
			broken lines of Virgil <span class="emph">giving utterance, like the voice of Nature 
				herself, to that pain and weariness yet hope of better things 
				which has been the experience of her children in every time.</span></p>

		

	  

	 

		<p class="textParagraph">He could wait no longer. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">From the door of Byron's publichouse to the gate of Clontarf 
			Chapel, from the gate of <span class="hide">53.364179 -6.201478</span>Clontarf Chapel to the door of 
			Byron's publichouse and then back again to the chapel and 
			then back again to the publichouse he had paced slowly at 
			first, planting his steps scrupulously in the spaces of the patchwork 
			of the footpath, then timing their fall to the fall of verses. 
			A full hour had passed since his father had gone in with Dan 
			Crosby, the tutor, to find out for him something about the 
			<span class="hide">53.310485 -6.225058</span>university. For a full hour he had paced up and down, 
			waiting: but he could wait no longer. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">He set off abruptly for <span class="hide">53.359381 -6.179831</span>the Bull, walking rapidly lest his 
			father's shrill whistle might call him back; and in a few moments 
			he had rounded the curve at the police barrack and was 
			safe. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Yes, his mother was hostile to the idea, as he  had read from 
			her listless silence. Yet her mistrust pricked him more keenly 
			than his father's pride and he thought coldly how he had 
			watched the faith which was fading down in his soul aging and 
			strengthening in her eyes. A dim antagonism gathered force 
			within him and darkened his mind as a cloud against her 
			disloyalty:  and when it  passed, cloudlike, leaving his mind 
			serene and dutiful towards her again, he was made aware 
			dimly and without regret of a first noiseless sundering of their 
			lives. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">The university! So he had passed beyond the challenge of 
			the  sentries who had stood as guardians of his boyhood and 
			had sought to keep him among them that he might be subject 
			to them and serve their ends. Pride after satisfaction uplifted 
			him like long slow waves. The end he had been born to serve 
			yet did not see had led him to escape by an unseen path: and 
			now it beckoned to him once more and a new adventure was 
			about to be opened to him. It seemed to him that he heard 
			notes of fitful music leaping upwards a tone and downwards a 
			diminished fourth, upwards a tone and downwards a major 
			third, like triplebranching flames leaping fitfully, flame after 
			flame, out of a midnight wood. It was an elfin prelude, endless 
			and formless; and, as it grew wilder and faster, the flames 
			leaping out of time, he seemed to hear from under the boughs 
			and grasses wild creatures racing, their feet pattering like rain 
			upon the leaves. Their feet passed in pattering tumult over his 
			mind, the feet of hares and rabbits, the feet of harts and hinds 
			and antelopes, until he heard them no more and remembered 
			only a proud cadence from Newman: <span class="emph">Whose feet are as the 
			feet of harts and underneath the everlasting arms.</span> </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">The pride of that dim image brought back to his mind the 
			dignity of the office he had refused. All through his boyhood 
			he had mused upon that which he had so often thought to be 
			his destiny and when the moment had come for him to obey 
			the call he had turned aside, obeying a wayward instinct. Now 
			time lay between: the oils of ordination would never anoint 
			his body. He had refused. Why? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">He turned seaward  from the road at <span class="hide">53.365979 -6.174239</span>Dollymount and as he 
			passed on to the thin wooden bridge he felt the planks shaking 
			with the tramp of heavily shod feet. A squad of christian 
			brothers was on its way back from the <span class="hide">53.369769 -6.147334</span>Bull and had begun to 
			pass, two by two, across the bridge. Soon the whole bridge 
			was trembling and resounding. The uncouth faces passed him 
			two by two, stained yellow or red or livid by the sea, and as 
			he strove to look at them with ease and indifference, a faint 
			stain of personal shame and commiseration rose to his own 
			face. Angry with himself he tried to hide his face from their 
			eyes by gazing down sideways into the shallow swirling water 
			under the bridge but he still saw a reflection therein of their 
			topheavy silk hats, and humble tapelike collars and loosely 
			hanging clerical clothes. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Brother Hickey. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Brother Quaid. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Brother MacArdle. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Brother Keogh. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Their piety would be like their names, like their faces, like 
			their clothes, and it was idle for him to tell himself that their 
			humble and contrite hearts, it might be, paid a far richer 
			tribute of devotion than his had ever been, a gift tenfold more 
			acceptable than his elaborate adoration. It was idle for him to 
			move himself to be generous towards them, to tell himself that 
			if he ever came to their gates, stripped of his pride, beaten and 
			in beggar's weeds, that they would be generous towards him, 
			loving him as themselves. Idle and embittering, finally,  to 
			argue, against his own dispassionate certitude, that the commandment 
			of love bade us not to love our neighbour  as ourselves 
			with the same amount and intensity of love but to love 
			him as ourselves with the same kind of love. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">He drew forth a phrase from his treasure and spoke it softly 
			to himself: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—A day of dappled seaborne clouds. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">The phrase and the day and the scene harmonised in a 
			chord. Words. Was it their colours? He allowed them to glow 
			and fade, hue after hue: sunrise gold, the russet and green of 
			apple orchards, azure of waves, the greyfringed fleece of 
			clouds. No, it was not their colours: it was the poise and 
			balance of the period itself. Did he then love the rhythmic rise 
			and fall of words better than their associations of legend and 
			colour? Or was it that, being as weak of sight as he was shy of 
			mind, he drew less pleasure from the reflection of the glowing 
			sensible world through the prism of a language manycoloured 
			and richly storied than from the contemplation of an inner 
			world of individual emotions mirrored perfectly in a lucid 
			supple periodic prose? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">He passed from the trembling bridge on to firm land again. 
			At that instant, as it seemed to him, the air was chilled and 
			looking askance towards the water he saw a flying squall 
			darkening and crisping suddenly the tide. A faint click at his 
			heart, a faint throb in his throat told him once more of how his 
			flesh dreaded the cold infrahuman odour of the sea: yet he did 
			not strike across the downs on his left but held straight on 
			along the spine of rocks that pointed against the river's mouth. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">A veiled sunlight lit up faintly the grey sheet of water where 
			the river was embayed. In the distance along the course of the 
			slowflowing Liffey slender masts flecked the sky and, more 
			distant still, the dim fabric of the city lay prone in haze. Like a 
			scene on some vague arras, old as man's weariness, the image 
			of the seventh city of christendom was visible to him across the 
			timeless air, no older nor more weary nor less patient of subjection 
			than in the days of the thingmote. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Disheartened, he raised his eyes towards the slowdrifting 
			clouds, dappled and seaborne. They were voyaging across the 
			deserts of the sky, a host of nomads on the march, voyaging 
			high over Ireland, westward bound. The Europe they had 
			come from lay out there beyond the <span class="hide">53.13 -5.32</span>Irish Sea, Europe of 
			strange tongues and valleyed and woodbegirt and citadelled 
			and of entrenched and marshalled races. He heard a confused 
			music within him as of memories and names which he was 
			almost conscious of but could not capture even for an instant; 
			then the music seemed to recede, to  recede, to recede: and 
			from each receding trail of nebulous music there fell always 
			one longdrawn calling note, piercing like a star the dusk of 
			silence. Again! Again! Again! A voice from beyond the world 
			was calling. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Hello, Stephanos! </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Here comes The Dedalus! </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Ao! ... Eh, give it over, Dwyer, I'm telling you or I'll 
			give you a stuff in the kisser for yourself .... Ao! </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Good man, Towser! Duck him! </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Come along, Dedalus! Bous Stephanoumenos! Bous 
			Stephaneforos! </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Duck him! Guzzle him now, Towser! </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Help! Help! ... Ao! </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">He recognised their speech collectively before he distinguished 
			their faces. The mere sight of that medley of wet 
			nakedness chilled him to the bone. Their bodies, corpsewhite 
			or suffused with a pallid golden light or rawly tanned by the 
			suns, gleamed with the wet of the sea. Their divingstone, 
			poised on its rude supports and rocking under their plunges, 
			and the roughhewn stones of the sloping breakwater over 
			which they scrambled in their horseplay, gleamed with cold wet 
			lustre. The towels with which they smacked their bodies were 
			heavy with cold seawater: and drenched with cold brine was 
			their matted hair. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">He stood still in deference to their calls and parried their 
			banter with easy words. How characterless they looked: 
			Shuley without his deep unbuttoned collar, Ennis without his 
			scarlet belt with the snaky clasp, and Connolly  without his 
			<span class="hide">52.613969 0.886402</span>Norfolk coat with the flapless sidepockets!  It was a pain to see 
			them and a swordlike pain to see the signs of adolescence that 
			made repellent their pitiable nakedness. Perhaps they had 
			taken refuge in number and noise from the secret dread in 
			their souls. But he, apart from them and in silence, remembered 
			in what dread he stood of the mystery of his own body. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Stephanos Dedalos! Bous Stephanoumenos! Bous Stephaneforos! </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Their banter was not new to him and now it flattered his 
			mild proud sovereignty. Now, as never before, his strange 
			name seemed to him a prophecy. So timeless seemed the grey 
			warm air, so fluid and impersonal his own mood, that all ages 
			were as one to him. A moment before the ghost of the ancient 
			kingdom of the Danes had looked forth through the vesture of 
			the hazewrapped city. Now, at the name of the fabulous 
			artificer, he seemed to hear the noise of dim waves and to see 
			a winged form flying above the waves and slowly climbing the 
			air. What did it mean? Was it a quaint device opening a page 
			of some medieval book of prophecies and symbols, a hawklike 
			man flying sunward above the sea, a prophecy of the end he 
			had been born to serve and had been following through the 
			mists of childhood and boyhood, a symbol of the artist forging 
			anew in his workshop out of the sluggish matter of the 
			earth a new soaring impalpable imperishable being? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">His heart trembled;  his breath came faster and a wild spirit 
			passed over his limbs as though he were soaring sunward. His 
			heart trembled in an ecstasy of fear and his soul was in flight. 
			His soul was soaring in an air beyond the world and the body 
			he knew was purified in a breath and delivered of incertitude 
			and made radiant and commingled with the element of the 
			spirit. An ecstasy of flight made radiant his eyes and wild his 
			breath  and tremulous and wild and radiant his windswept 
			limbs. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—One! Two! ... Look out! </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—O, cripes, I'm drownded! </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—One! Two! Three and away! </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Me next! Me next! </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—One! ... Uk! </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Stephaneforos! </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">His throat ached with a desire to cry aloud, the cry of a 
			hawk or eagle on high, to cry piercingly of his deliverance to 
			the winds. This was the call of life to his soul not the dull gross 
			voice of the world of duties and despair, not the inhuman 
			voice that had called him to the pale service of the altar. An 
			instant of wild flight had delivered him and the cry of triumph 
			which his lips withheld cleft his brain. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Stephaneforos! </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">What were they now but cerements shaken from the 
			body of death - the fear he had walked in night and day, the 
			incertitude that had ringed him round, the shame that had 
			abased him within and without - cerements, the linens of the 
			grave? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">His soul had arisen from the grave of boyhood, spurning 
			her graveclothes.  Yes! Yes! Yes! He would create proudly out 
			of the freedom and power of his soul, as the great artificer 
			whose name he bore, a living thing, new and soaring and 
			beautiful, impalpable, imperishable. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">He started up nervously from the stoneblock for he could 
			no longer quench the flame in his blood. He felt his cheeks 
			aflame and his throat throbbing with song. There was a lust of 
			wandering in his feet that burned to set out for the ends of the 
			earth. On! On! his heart seemed to cry. Evening would deepen 
			above the sea, night fall upon the plains, dawn glimmer before 
			the wanderer and show him strange fields and hills and faces. 
			Where? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">He looked northward towards <span class="hide">53.378569 -6.057013</span>Howth. The sea had fallen 
			below the line of seawrack on the shallow side of the breakwater 
			and already the tide was running out fast along the 
			foreshore. Already one long oval bank of sand lay warm and 
			dry amid the wavelets. Here and there warm isles of sand 
			gleamed above the shallow tide, and about the isles and 
			around the long bank and amid the shallow currents of the 
			beach were lightclad gayclad figures, wading and delving. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">In a few moments he was barefoot, his stockings folded in 
			his pockets and his canvas shoes dangling by their knotted 
			laces over his shoulders: and, picking a pointed salteaten stick 
			out of the jetsam among the rocks, he clambered down the 
			slope of the breakwater. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">There was a long rivulet in the <span class="hide">53.366498 -6.147804</span>strand: and, as he waded 
			slowly up its course, he wondered at the endless drift of seaweed. 
			Emerald and black and russet and olive, it moved beneath 
			the current, swaying and turning. The water of the 
			rivulet was dark with endless drift and mirrored the highdrifting 
			clouds. The clouds were drifting above him silently 
			and silently the seatangle was drifting below him; and the grey 
			warm air was still: and a new wild life was singing in his veins. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Where was his boyhood now? Where was the soul that had 
			hung back from her destiny, to brood alone upon the shame of 
			her wounds and in her house of squalor and subterfuge to 
			queen it in faded cerements and in wreaths that withered at 
			the touch? Or where was he? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">He was alone. He was unheeded, happy and near to the 
			wild heart of life. He was alone and young and wilful and 
			wildhearted, alone amid a waste of wild air and brackish 
			waters and the seaharvest of shells and tangle and veiled grey 
			sunlight and gayclad lightclad figures, of children and girls and 
			voices childish and girlish in the air. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">A girl stood before him in midstream, alone and still, gazing 
			out to sea. She seemed like one whom magic had changed into 
			the likeness of a strange and beautiful seabird. Her long slender 
			bare legs were delicate as a crane's and pure save where an 
			emerald trail of seaweed had fashioned itself as a sign upon 
			the flesh. Her thighs, fuller and softhued as ivory, were bared 
			almost to the hips where the white fringes of her drawers were 
			like featherings of soft white down. Her slateblue skirts were 
			kilted boldly about her waist and dovetailed behind her. Her 
			bosom was as  a bird's soft and slight, slight and soft as the 
			breast of some darkplumaged dove. But her long fair hair was 
			girlish: and girlish, and touched with the wonder of mortal 
			beauty, her face. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">She was alone and still, gazing out to sea; and when she felt 
			his presence and the worship of his eyes her eyes turned to 
			him in quiet sufferance of his gaze, without shame or wantonness. 
			Long, long she suffered his gaze and then quietly withdrew 
			her eyes from his and bent them towards the stream, 
			gently stirring the water with her foot hither and thither. The 
			first faint noise of gently moving water broke the silence, low 
			and faint and whispering, faint as the bells of sleep; hither and 
			thither, hither and thither: and a faint flame trembled on her 
			cheek. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Heavenly God! cried Stephen's soul, in an outburst of 
			profane joy. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">He turned away from her suddenly and set off across the 
			<span class="hide">53.366498 -6.147804</span>strand. His cheeks  were aflame; his body was aglow; his limbs 
			were trembling. On and on and on and on he strode, far out 
			over the sands, singing wildly to the sea, crying to greet the 
			advent of the life that had cried to him. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Her image had passed into his soul for ever and no word 
			had broken the holy silence of his ecstasy. Her eyes had called 
			him and his soul had leaped at the call. To live, to err, to fall, 
			to triumph, to recreate life out of life! A wild angel had appeared 
			to him, the angel of mortal youth and beauty, an envoy 
			from the fair courts of life, to throw open before him in an 
			instant of ecstasy the gates of all the ways of error and glory. 
			On and on and on and on! </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">He halted suddenly and heard his heart in the silence. How 
			far had he walked? What hour was it? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">There was no human figure near him nor any sound borne 
			to him over the air. But the tide was near the turn and already 
			the day was on the wane. He turned landward and ran towards 
			the shore and, running up the sloping beach, reckless of the 
			sharp shingle, found a sandy nook amid a ring of tufted sandknolls 
			and lay down there that the peace and silence of the 
			evening might still the riot of his blood. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">He  felt above him the vast indifferent dome and the calm 
			processes of the heavenly bodies; and the earth beneath him, 
			the earth that had borne him, had taken him to her breast. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">He closed his eyes in the languor of sleep. His eyelids 
			trembled as if they felt the vast cyclic movement of the earth 
			and her watchers, trembled as if they felt the strange light of 
			some new world. His soul was swooning into some new world, 
			fantastic, dim, uncertain as under sea, traversed by cloudy 
			shapes and beings. A world, a glimmer, or a flower? Glimmering 
			and trembling, trembling and unfolding, a breaking light, 
			an opening flower, it spread in endless succession to itself, 
			breaking in full crimson and unfolding and fading to palest 
			rose, leaf by leaf and wave of light by wave of light, flooding 
			all the heavens with its soft flushes, every flush deeper than 
			other. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Evening had fallen when he woke and the sand and arid 
			grasses of his bed glowed no longer. He rose slowly and, 
			recalling the rapture of his sleep, sighed at its joy. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">He climbed to the crest of the sandhill and gazed about 
			him. Evening had fallen. A rim of the young moon cleft the 
			pale waste of sky like the rim of a silver hoop embedded in 
			grey sand; and the tide was flowing in fast to the land with a 
			low whisper of her waves, islanding a few last figures in distant 
			pools. </p>

	 
 



	 

		<h2 class="heading">V<br>
</h2>

		<p class="textParagraph">He drained his third cup of watery tea to the dregs and 
			set to chewing the crusts of fried bread that were scattered 
			near him, staring into the dark pool of the jar. The 
			yellow dripping had been scooped out like a boghole and the 
			pool under it brought back to his memory the dark turfcoloured 
			water of the bath in <span class="hide">53.310601 -6.695541</span>Clongowes. The box of pawn-tickets 
			at his elbow had just been rifled and he took up idly 
			one after another in his greasy fingers the blue and white 
			dockets, scrawled and sanded and creased and bearing the 
			name of the pledger as Daly or MacEvoy. </p>

		<p class="textParagraph">1 Pair Buskins. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">1 D. Coat. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">3 Articles and White. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">1 Man's Pants. </p>

		<p class="textParagraph">Then he put them aside and gazed thoughtfully at the lid of 
			the box, speckled with lousemarks, and asked vaguely: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph"><p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>—How much is the clock fast now? </p></p>
		<p class="textParagraph">His mother straightened the battered alarmclock that was 
			lying on its side in the middle of the kitchen mantelpiece until 
			its dial showed a quarter to twelve and then laid it once more 
			on its side. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph"><p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mary Dedalus</span>—An hour and twentyfive minutes, she said. The right time 
			now is  twenty past ten. The dear knows you might try to be in 
			time for your lectures. </p></p>
		<p class="textParagraph"><p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>—Fill out the place for me to wash, said Stephen. </p></p>

		<p class="textParagraph"><p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Boody</span>—I can't, I'm going for blue. Fill it out, you, Maggie. </p></p>
		<p class="textParagraph">When the enamelled basin had  been fitted into the well of 
			the sink and the old washingglove flung on the side of it he 
			allowed his mother to scrub his neck and root into the folds of 
			his ears and into the interstices at the wings of his nose. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph"><p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mary Dedalus</span>—Well, it's a poor case, she said, when a university student 
			is so dirty that his mother has to wash him. </p></p>
		<p class="textParagraph"><p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>—But it gives you pleasure, said Stephen calmly. </p></p>
		<p class="textParagraph">An earsplitting whistle was heard from upstairs and his 
			mother thrust  a damp overall into his hands, saying: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph"><p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mary Dedalus</span>—Dry yourself and hurry out for the love of goodness. </p></p>
		<p class="textParagraph">A second shrill whistle, prolonged angrily, brought one of 
			the girls to the foot of the staircase. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Yes, father? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph"><p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>—Is your lazy bitch of a brother gone out yet? </p></p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Yes, father. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph"><p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>—Sure? </p></p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Yes, father. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph"><p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>—Hm! </p></p>
		<p class="textParagraph">The girl came back making signs  to him to be quick and go 
			out quietly by the back. Stephen laughed and said: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph"><p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>—He has  a curious idea of genders if he thinks a bitch is 
			masculine. </p></p>
		<p class="textParagraph"><p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mary Dedalus</span>—Ah, it's a scandalous shame for you, Stephen, said his

		<p class="textParagraph"><p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>—Good morning, everybody, said Stephen, smiling and 
			kissing the tips of his fingers in adieu. </p></p>
		<p class="textParagraph">The lane  behind the terrace was waterlogged and as he 
			went down it slowly, choosing his steps amid heaps of wet 
			rubbish, he heard a mad nun screeching in the <span class="hide">53.364283 -6.244879</span>nuns' madhouse 
			beyond the wall. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Jesus! O Jesus! Jesus! </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">He shook the sound out of his ears by an angry toss of his 
			head and hurried on, stumbling through the mouldering offal, 
			his heart already bitten by an ache of loathing and bitterness. 
			His father's whistle, his mother's mutterings, the screech of an 
			unseen maniac were to him now so many voices offending and 
			threatening to humble the pride of his youth. He drove their 
			echoes even out of his heart with an execration: but, as he 
			walked down the avenue and felt the grey morning light falling 
			about him through the dripping trees and smelt the strange 
			wild smell of the wet leaves and bark, his soul was loosed of 
			her miseries. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">The rainladen trees of the avenue evoked in him, as always, 
			memories of the girls and women in the plays of Gerhart 
			Hauptmann; and the memory of their pale sorrows and the 
			fragrance falling from the wet branches mingled in a mood of 
			quiet joy. His morning walk across <span class="hide">53.363150 -6.270676</span>the city had begun, and he 
			foreknew that as he passed the sloblands of Fairview he would 
			think of the cloistral silverveined prose of Newman, that as he 
			walked along <span class="hide">53.357548 -6.242725</span>the North Strand Road, glancing idly at the 
			windows of the provision shops, he would recall the dark 
			humour of Guido Cavalcanti and smile, that as he went by 
			Baird's stonecutting works in <span class="hide">53.350416 -6.251694</span>Talbot Place the spirit of Ibsen
			would blow through him like a keen wind, a spirit of wayward 
			boyish beauty, and that passing a grimy marinedealer's shop 
			beyond the Liffey he would repeat the song by Ben Jonson 
			which begins: </p>
		<span class="emph">I was not wearier where I lay.</span> <br>
		<p class="textParagraph">His mind, when wearied of its search for the essence of 
			beauty amid the spectral words of Aristotle or Aquinas, 
			turned often for its pleasure to the dainty songs of the Elizabethans. 
			His mind, in the vesture of a doubting monk, stood 
			often in shadow under the windows of that age, to hear the 
			grave and mocking music of the lutenists or the frank laughter 
			of waistcoateers until a laugh too low, a phrase, tarnished by 
			time, of chambering and false honour, stung his monkish pride 
			and drove him on from his lurkingplace. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">The lore which he was believed to pass his days brooding 
			upon so that it had rapt him from the companionships of 
			youth was only a garner of slender sentences from Aristotle's 
			poetics and psychology and a Synopsis Philosophiae Scholasticae ad mentem divi Thomae. His thinking was a dusk 
			of doubt and selfmistrust lit up at moments by the lightnings of 
			intuition, but lightnings of so clear a splendour that in those 
			moments the world perished about his feet as if it had been 
			fireconsumed: and thereafter his tongue grew heavy and he 
			met the eyes of others with unanswering eyes for he felt that 
			the spirit of beauty had folded him round like a mantle and 
			that in revery at least he had been acquainted with nobility. 
			But, when this brief pride of silence upheld him no longer, he 
			was glad to find himself still in the midst of common lives, 
			passing on his way amid the squalor and noise and sloth of the 
			city fearlessly and with a light heart. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Near the hoardings on the canal he met the consumptive 
			man with the doll's face and the brimless hat coming towards 
			him down the slope of the bridge with little steps, tightly 
			buttoned into his chocolate overcoat,  and holding his furled 
			umbrella a span or two from him like a diviningrod. It must 
			be eleven, he thought, and peered into a dairy to see the time. 
			The clock in the dairy told him that it was five minutes to five 
			but, as he turned away, he heard a clock somewhere near him, 
			but unseen, beating eleven strokes in swift precision. He 
			laughed as he heard it for it made him think of MacCann and 
			he saw him a squat figure in a shooting jacket and breeches 
			and with a fair goatee, standing in the wind at <span class="hide">53.351242 -6.260779</span>Hopkins' corner, 
			and heard him say: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph"><p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">MacCann</span>—Dedalus, you're an antisocial being, wrapped up in 
			yourself. I'm not. I'm a democrat: and I'll work and act for 
			social liberty and equality among all classes and sexes in the 
			United States of the Europe of the future. </p></p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Eleven! Then he was late for that lecture too. What day of 
			the week was it? He stopped at a newsagent's to read the 
			headline of a placard. Thursday.  Ten to eleven, English; 
			eleven to twelve, French;  twelve to one, physics. He fancied to 
			himself the English lecture and felt, even at that distance, 
			restless and helpless. He saw the heads of his classmates 
			meekly bent as they wrote in their notebooks the points they 
			were bidden to note, nominal definitions, essential definitions 
			and examples or dates of birth or death, chief works, a favourable 
			and an unfavourable criticism side by side. His own 
			head was unbent for his thoughts wandered abroad and 
			whether he looked around the little class of students or out of 
			the window across the desolate gardens of the green an odour 
			assailed him of cheerless cellardamp and decay. Another head 
			than his, right before him in the first benches, was poised 
			squarely above its bending fellows like the head of a priest 
			appealing without humility to the tabernacle for the humble 
			worshippers about him. Why was it that when he thought of 
			Cranly he could never raise before his mind the entire image 
			of his body but only the image of the head and face? Even 
			now against the grey curtain of the morning he saw it before 
			him like the phantom of a dream, the face of a severed head or 
			deathmask, crowned on the brows by its stiff black upright 
			hair as by an iron crown. It was a priestlike face, priestlike in 
			its pallor, in the widewinged nose, in the shadowings below the 
			eyes and along the jaws, priestlike in the lips that were long 
			and bloodless and faintly smiling: and Stephen, remembering 
			swiftly how he had told Cranly of all the tumults and unrest 
			and longings in his soul, day after day and night by night, only 
			to be answered by his friend's listening silence, would have 
			told himself that it was the face of a guilty priest who heard 
			confessions of those whom  he had not power to absolve but 
			that he felt again in memory the gaze of its dark womanish 
			eyes. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Through this image he had a glimpse of a strange dark 
			cavern of speculation but at once turned away from it, feeling 
			that it was not yet the hour  to enter it. But the nightshade of 
			his friend's listlessness seemed to be diffusing in the air around 
			him a tenuous and deadly exhalation and he found himself 
			glancing from one casual word to another on his right or left 
			in stolid wonder that they had been so silently emptied of 
			instantaneous sense until every mean shop legend bound his 
			mind like the words of a spell and his soul shrivelled up, sighing 
			with age as he walked on in a lane among heaps of dead 
			language. His own consciousness of language was ebbing from 
			his brain and trickling into the very words themselves which 
			set to band and disband themselves in wayward rhythms: </p>
		<p class="lg">
			The ivy whines upon the wall <br>
			And whines and twines upon the wall <br>
			The ivy whines upon the wall <br>
			The yellow ivy on the wall <br>
			Ivy, ivy up the wall. <br>
		</p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Did any one ever hear such drivel? Lord Almighty! Who 
			ever heard of ivy whining on a wall? Yellow ivy: that was all 
			right. Yellow ivory also. And what about ivory ivy? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">The word now shone in his brain, clearer and brighter than 
			any ivory sawn from the mottled tusks of elephants. <span class="emph">Ivory, 
				ivoire, avorio, ebur.</span> One of the first examples that he had 
			learnt in Latin had run: India mittit ebur; and he recalled the 
			shrewd northern face of the rector who had taught him to 
			construe the Metamorphoses of Ovid in a courtly English, 
			made whimsical by the mention of porkers and potsherds and 
			chines of bacon. He had learnt what little he knew of the laws 
			of Latin verse from a ragged book written by a Portuguese 
			priest. </p>
		Contrahit orator, variant in carmine vates. <br>
		<p class="textParagraph">The crises and victories and secessions in Roman history were 
			handed on to him in the trite words in tanto discrimine and he 
			had tried to peer into the social life of the city of cities through 
			the words implere ollam denariorum which the rector had 
			rendered sonorously as the filling of a pot with denaries.  The 
			pages of his timeworn Horace never felt cold to the touch even 
			when his own fingers were cold:  they were human pages: and 
			fifty years before they had been turned by the human fingers 
			of John Duncan Inverarity and by his brother, William Malcolm 
				Inverarity. Yes, those were noble names on the dusky 
			flyleaf and, even for so poor a Latinist as he, the dusky verses 
			were as fragrant as though they had lain all those years in 
			myrtle and lavender and vervain; but yet it wounded him to 
			think that he would never be but a shy guest at the feast of the 
			world's culture and that the monkish learning, in terms of 
			which he was striving to forge out an esthetic philosophy, was 
			held no higher by the age he lived in than the subtle and 
			curious jargons of heraldry and falconry. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">The grey block <span class="hide">53.345478 -6.257690</span>of Trinity on his left, set heavily in the city's 
			ignorance like a great dull stone set in a cumbrous ring, pulled 
			his mind downward; and while he was striving this way and 
			that to free his feet from the fetters of the reformed conscience 
			he came upon the droll statue of the national poet of Ireland. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">He looked at it without anger: for, though sloth of the body 
			and of  the soul crept over it like unseen vermin, over the 
			shuffling feet and up the folds of the cloak and around the 
			servile head, it seemed humbly conscious of its indignity. It 
			was a Firbolg in the borrowed cloak of a Milesian; and he 
			thought of his friend Davin, the peasant student. It was a 
			jesting name between them but the young peasant bore with it 
			lightly saying: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph"><p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Davin</span>—Go on, Stevie,  I have a hard head, you tell me. Call me 
			what you will. </p></p>
		<p class="textParagraph">The homely version of his christian name on the lips of his 
			friend had touched Stephen pleasantly when first heard for he 
			was as formal in speech with others as they were with him. 
			Often, as he sat in Davin's rooms in <span class="hide">53.334106 -6.266592</span>Grantham Street, wondering 
			at his friend's wellmade boots that flanked the wall pair by 
			pair and repeating for his friend's simple ear the verses and 
			cadences of others which were the veils of his own longing and 
			dejection, the rude Firbolg mind of his listener had drawn his 
			mind towards it and flung it back again, drawing it by a quiet 
			inbred courtesy of attention or by a quaint turn of old English 
			speech or by the force of its delight in rude bodily skill - for 
			Davin had sat at the feet of Michael Cusack, the Gael - 
			repelling swiftly and suddenly by a grossness of intelligence or 
			by a bluntness of feeling or by a dull stare of terror in the eyes, 
			the terror of soul of a starving Irish village in which the curfew 
			was still a nightly fear. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Side by side with his memory of the deeds of prowess of his 
			uncle Mat Davin, the athlete, the young peasant worshipped 
			the sorrowful legend of Ireland. The gossip of his fellowstudents 
			which strove to render the flat life of the college 
			significant at any cost loved to think of him as a young fenian. 
			His nurse had taught him Irish and shaped his rude imagination 
			by the broken lights of Irish myth. He stood towards this 
			myth upon which no individual mind had ever drawn out a 
			line of beauty and to its unwieldy  tales that divided themselves 
			as they moved down the cycles in the same attitude as towards 
			the Roman catholic religion, the attitude of a dullwitted loyal 
			serf. Whatsoever of thought or of feeling came to him from 
			England or by way of English culture his mind stood armed 
			against in obedience to a password: and of the world that lay 
			beyond England he knew only the foreign legion of <span class="hide">46.227638 2.213749</span>France in 
			which he spoke of serving. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Coupling this ambition with the young man's humour 
			Stephen had often called him one of the tame geese: and there 
			was even a point of irritation in the name pointed against that 
			very reluctance of speech and deed in his friend which seemed 
			so often to stand between Stephen's mind, eager of speculation, 
			and the hidden ways of Irish life. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">One night the young peasant, his spirit stung by the violent 
			or luxurious language in which Stephen escaped from the cold 
			silence of intellectual revolt, had called up before Stephen's 
			mind a strange vision. The two were walking slowly towards 
			Davin's room through the dark narrow streets of the poorer 
			jews. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph"><p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Davin</span>—A thing happened to myself, Stevie, last autumn, coming 
			on winter, and I never told it to a living soul and you are the 
			first person now I ever told it to. I disremember if it was 
			October or November. It was October because it was before  I 
			came up here to join the matriculation class. </p></p>
	<p class="textParagraph">Stephen had turned his smiling eyes towards his friend's 
			face, flattered by his confidence and won over to sympathy by 
			the speaker's simple accent. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph"><p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Davin</span>—I was away all that day from my own place over in <span class="hide">52.232134 -8.670125</span>Buttevant 
			- I don't know if you know where that is - at a hurling 
			match between the Croke's Own Boys and the Fearless 
			Thurles and by God, Stevie, that was the hard fight. My first 
			cousin, Fonsy Davin, was stripped to his buff that day minding 
			cool for the Limericks but he was up with the forwards half 
			the time and shouting like mad. I never will forget that day. 
			One of the Crokes made a woeful wipe at him one time with 
			his camaun and I declare to God he was within an aim's ace of 
			getting it at the side of the temple. Oh, honest to God, if the 
			crook of it caught him that time he was done for. </p></p>
		<p class="textParagraph"><p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>—I am glad he escaped, Stephen had said with a laugh, but 
			surely that's not the strange thing  that happened you? </p></p>
		<p class="textParagraph"><p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Davin</span>—Well, I suppose that doesn't interest you but leastways 
			there was such noise after the match that I missed the train 
			home and I couldn't get any kind of a yoke to give me a lift for, 
			as luck would have it, there was a mass meeting that same day 
			over in Castletownrocheand all the cars in the country were 
			there. So there was nothing for it only to stay the night or to 
			foot it out. Well, I started to walk and on I went and it was 
			coming on night when I got into the  <span class="hide">52.303056 -8.538611</span>Ballyhoura hills; that's 
			better than ten miles from <span class="hide">52.399821 -8.575387</span>Kilmallock and there's a long lonely 
			road after that.  You wouldn't see the sign of a christian house 
			along the road or hear a sound. It was pitch dark almost. Once 
			or twice I stopped by the way under a bush to redden my pipe 
			and only for the dew was thick I'd have stretched out there 
			and slept. At last, after a bend of the road, I spied a little 
			cottage with a light in the window. I went up and knocked at 
			the door. A voice asked who was there and I answered I was 
			over at the match in Buttevant and was walking back and that 
			I'd be thankful for a glass of water. After a while a young 
			woman opened the door and brought me out a big mug of 
			milk. She was half undressed as if she was going to bed when I 
			knocked and she had her hair hanging; and I thought by her 
			figure and by something in the look of her eyes that she must 
			be carrying a child. She kept me in talk a long while at the 
			door and I thought it strange because her breast and her 
			shoulders were bare. She asked me was I tired and would I 
			like to stop the night there. She said she was all alone in the 
			house and that her husband had gone that morning to <span class="hide">53.273188 -6.092767</span>Queenstown
			with his sister to see her off. And all the time she was 
			talking, Stevie, she had her eyes fixed on my face and she 
			stood so close to me I could hear her breathing. When I 
			handed her back the mug at last she took my hand to draw me 
			in over the threshold and said: <span class="emph">Come in and stay the night
			here. You've no call to be frightened. There's no one in it but
			ourselves</span> .... I didn't go in, Stevie.  I thanked her and went 
			on my way again, all in a fever. At the first bend of the road I 
			looked back and she was standing at the door. </p></p>
	<p class="textParagraph">The last words of Davin's story sang in his memory  and the 
			figure of the woman in the story stood forth, reflected in other 
			figures of the peasant women whom he had seen standing in 
			the doorways at <span class="hide">53.293785 -6.687040</span>Clane as the college cars drove by, as a type 
			of her race and his own, a batlike soul waking to the consciousness 
			of itself in darkness and secrecy and loneliness and, 
			through the eyes and voice and gesture of a woman without 
			guile, calling the stranger to her bed. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">A hand was laid on his arm and a young voice cried: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Ah, gentleman, your own girl, sir! The first handsel 
			today, gentleman. Buy  that lovely bunch. Will you, gentleman? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">The blue flowers which she lifted towards him and her 
			young blue eyes seemed to him at that instant images of guilelessness; 
			and he halted till the image had vanished and he saw 
			only her ragged dress and damp coarse hair and  hoydenish 
			face. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Do, gentleman! Don't forget your own girl, sir! </p>
		<p class="textParagraph"><p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>—I have no money, said Stephen. </p></p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Buy them lovely ones, will you, sir? Only a penny. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph"><p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>—Did you hear what I said? asked Stephen, bending towards

		<p class="textParagraph">—Well, sure, you will some day, sir, please God, the girl 
			answered after an instant. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph"><p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>—Possibly, said Stephen, but I don't think it likely. </p></p>
		<p class="textParagraph">He left her quickly, fearing that her intimacy might turn to 
			gibing and wishing to be out of the way before she offered her 
			ware to another, a tourist from England or a student of Trinity. 
			<span class="hide">53.342300 -6.259747</span>Grafton Street, along which he walked, prolonged that 
			moment of discouraged poverty. In the roadway at the head of 
			the street a slab was set to the memory of Wolfe Tone and he 
			remembered having been present with his father at its laying. 
			He remembered with bitterness that scene of tawdry tribute. 
			There were four French delegates in a brake and one, a plump 
			smiling young man, held, wedged on a stick,  a card on which 
			were printed the words: Vive l'Irlande!</p>
		<p class="textParagraph">But the trees in <span class="hide">53.338174 -6.259119</span>Stephen's Green were fragrant of rain and 
			the rainsodden earth gave forth its mortal odour, a faint 
			incense rising upward through the mould from many hearts. 
			The soul of the gallant venal city which his elders had told him 
			of had shrunk with time to a faint mortal odour rising from the 
			earth and he knew that in a moment when he entered the 
			sombre college he would be conscious of a corruption other 
			than that of Buck Egan and Burnchapel Whaley. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">It was too late to go upstairs to the French class. He 
			crossed the hall and took the corridor to the left which led to 
			the physics theatre. The corridor was dark and silent but not 
			unwatchful. Why did he feel that it was not unwatchful? Was 
			it because he had heard that in Buck Whaley's time there was 
			a secret staircase there? Or was the jesuit house extraterritorial 
			and was he walking among aliens? The Irelandof Tone 
			and of Parnell seemed to have receded in space. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">He opened the door of the theatre and halted in the chilly 
			grey light that struggled through the dusty windows. A figure 
			was crouching before the large grate and by its leanness and 
			greyness he knew that it was the dean of studies lighting the 
			fire. Stephen closed the door quietly and approached the 
			fireplace. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Good morning, sir! Can I help you? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">The priest looked up quickly and said: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—One moment now, Mr Dedalus, and you will see. There 
			is an art in lighting a fire. We have the liberal arts and we have 
			the useful arts. This is one of the useful arts. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—I will try to learn it, said Stephen. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Not too much coal, said the dean, working briskly at his 
			task, that is one of the secrets. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">He produced four candlebutts from the sidepockets of his 
			soutane and placed them deftly among the coals and twisted 
			papers. Stephen watched him in silence. Kneeling thus on the 
			flagstone to kindle the fire and busied with the disposition of 
			his wisps of paper and candlebutts he seemed more than ever 
			a humble server making ready the place of sacrifice in an 
			empty temple, a levite of the Lord. Like a levite's robe of 
			plain linen the faded worn soutane draped the kneeling figure 
			of one whom the canonicals or the  bellbordered ephod would 
			irk and trouble. His very body had waxed old in lowly service 
			of the Lord - in tending the fire upon the altar, in bearing 
			tidings secretly, in waiting upon worldlings, in striking swiftly 
			when bidden - and yet had remained ungraced by aught of 
			saintly or of prelatic beauty. Nay, his very soul had waxed old 
			in that service without growing towards light and beauty or 
			spreading abroad a sweet odour of her sanctity - a mortified 
			will no more responsive to the thrill of its obedience than was 
			to the thrill of love or combat his aging body, spare and sinewy, 
			greyed with a silverpointed down. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">The dean rested back on his hunkers and watched the sticks 
			catch. Stephen, to fill the silence, said: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—I am sure I could not light a fire. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—You are an artist, are you not, Mr Dedalus? said the 
			dean, glancing up and blinking his pale eyes. The object of the 
			artist is the creation of the beautiful. What the beautiful is is 
			another question. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">He rubbed his hands slowly and drily over the difficulty. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Can you solve that question now? he asked. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Aquinas, answered Stephen, says Pulcra
			sunt quae visa placent.</p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—This fire before us, said the dean, will be pleasing to the 
			eye. Will it therefore be beautiful? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—In so far as it is apprehended by the sight, which I suppose 
			means here esthetic intellection, it will be beautiful. But 
			Aquinas also says Bonum est in quod tendit appetitus. In so 
			far as it satisfies the animal craving for warmth fire is a good. 
			In hell however it is an evil. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Quite so, said the dean, you have certainly hit the nail on 
			the head. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">He rose nimbly and went towards the door, set it ajar and 
			said: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—A draught is said to be a help in these matters. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">As he came back to the hearth, limping slightly but with a 
			brisk step, Stephen saw the silent soul of a jesuit look out at 
			him from the pale loveless eyes. Like Ignatius he was lame but 
			in his eyes burned no spark of Ignatius' enthusiasm. Even the 
			legendary craft of the company, a craft subtler and more 
			secret than its fabled books of secret subtle wisdom, had not 
			fired his soul with the energy of apostleship. It seemed as if 
			he used the shifts and lore and cunning of the world, as bidden 
			to do, for the greater glory of God, without joy in their 
			handling or hatred of that in them which was evil but turning 
			them, with a firm gesture of obedience, back upon themselves: 
			and for all this silent service it seemed as if he loved not at all 
			the master and little, if at all, the ends he served. Similiter 
			atque senis baculus, he was, as the founder would have had 
			him, like a staff in an old man's hand, to be left in a corner, to 
			be leaned on in the road at nightfall or in stress of weather,  to 
			lie with a lady's nosegay on a garden seat, to be raised in 
			menace. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">The dean returned to the hearth and began to stroke his 
			chin. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—When may we expect to have something from you on the 
			esthetic question? he asked. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—From me! said Stephen in astonishment. I stumble on  an 
			idea once a fortnight if I am lucky. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—These questions are very profound, Mr Dedalus, said the 
			dean. It is like looking down from the <span class="hide">53.545240 -7.943510</span>cliffs of Moher into the 
			depths. Many go down into the depths and never come up. 
			Only the trained diver can go down into those depths and 
			explore them and come to the surface again. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—If you mean speculation, sir, said Stephen, I also am sure 
			that there is no such thing  as free thinking inasmuch as all 
			thinking must be bound by its own laws. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Ha! </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—For my purpose I can work on at present by the light of 
			one or two ideas of Aristotle and Aquinas. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—I see. I quite see your point. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—I need them only for my own use and guidance until I 
			have done something for myself by their light. If the lamp 
			smokes or smells I shall try to trim it. If it does not give light 
			enough I shall sell it and buy another. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Epictetus also had a lamp, said the dean, which was sold 
			for a fancy price after his death. It was the lamp he wrote his 
			philosophical dissertations by. You know Epictetus? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—An old gentleman, said Stephen coarsely, who said that 
			the soul is very like a bucketful of water. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—He tells us in his homely way, the dean went on, that 
			he put an iron lamp before a statue of one of the gods and that 
			a thief stole the lamp. What did the philosopher do? He reflected 
			that it was in the character of a thief to steal and 
			determined to buy an earthen lamp next day instead of the 
			iron lamp. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">A smell  of molten  tallow came up from the dean's candle-butts 
			and fused itself in Stephen's consciousness with the 
			jingle of the words, bucket and lamp and lamp and bucket. The 
			priest's voice too had a hard jingling tone. Stephen's mind 
			halted by instinct, checked by the strange tone and the  imagery 
			and by the priest's face which seemed like an unlit lamp 
			or a reflector  hung in a false focus. What lay behind it or 
			within it? A dull torpor of the soul or the dullness of the 
			thundercloud, charged with intellection and capable of the 
			gloom of God? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—I meant a different kind of lamp, sir, said Stephen. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Undoubtedly, said the dean. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—One difficulty, said Stephen, in esthetic discussion is to 
			know whether words are being used according to the literary 
			tradition or according to the tradition of the marketplace. I 
			remember a sentence of Newman's in which he says of the 
			Blessed Virgin that she was detained in the full company of the 
			saints. The use of the word in the marketplace is quite 
			different. <span class="emph">I hope I am not detaining you.</span> </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Not in the least, said the dean politely. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—No, no, said Stephen, smiling, I mean ... </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Yes, yes: I see, said the dean quickly, I quite catch the 
			point: <span class="emph">detain</span>. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">He thrust forward his under jaw and uttered a dry short 
			cough. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—To return to the lamp, he said, the feeding of it is also a 
			nice problem. You must choose the pure oil and you must be 
			careful when you pour it in not to overflow it, not to pour in 
			more than the funnel can hold. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—What funnel? asked Stephen. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—The funnel through which you pour the  oil into your 
			lamp. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—That? said Stephen. Is that called a funnel? Is it not a 
			tundish? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—What is a tundish? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—That. The ... the funnel. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Is that called a tundish in Ireland? asked the dean. I 
			never heard the word in my life. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—It is called a tundish in <span class="hide">53.364757 -6.256734</span>Lower Drumcondra, said Stephen 
			laughing, where they speak the best English. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—A tundish, said the dean reflectively. That is a most 
			interesting word. I must look that word up. Upon my word I 
			must. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">His courtesy of manner rang a little false, and Stephen 
			looked at the English convert with the same eyes as the elder 
			brother in the parable may have turned on the prodigal. A 
			humble follower in the wake of clamorous conversions,  a 
			poor Englishman in Ireland, he seemed to have entered on the 
			stage of jesuit history when that strange play of intrigue and 
			suffering and envy and struggle and indignity had been all but 
			given through - a late comer, a tardy spirit.  From what had he 
			set out? Perhaps he had been born and bred among serious 
			dissenters, seeing salvation in Jesus only and abhorring the 
			vain pomps of the establishment. Had he felt the need of an 
			implicit faith amid the welter of sectarianism and the jargon of 
			its turbulent schisms, six principle men, peculiar people, seed 
			and snake baptists, supralapsarian dogmatists? Had he found 
			the true church all of a sudden in winding up to the end like 
			a reel of cotton some finespun line of reasoning upon insufflation 
			or the imposition of hands or the procession of the 
			Holy Ghost? Or had Lord Christ touched him and bidden him 
			follow, like that disciple who had sat at the receipt of custom, 
			as he sat by the door of some zincroofed chapel, yawning and 
			telling over his church pence? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">The dean repeated the word yet again. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Tundish! Well now, that is interesting! </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—The question you asked me a moment ago seems to me 
			more interesting. What is that beauty which the artist struggles 
			to express from lumps of earth, said Stephen coldly. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">The little word seemed to have turned a rapier point of his 
			sensitiveness against this courteous and vigilant foe. He felt 
			with a smart of dejection that the man to whom he was speaking 
			was a countryman of Ben Jonson. He thought: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—The language in which we are speaking is his before it is 
			mine. How different are the words <span class="emph">home, Christ, ale, master</span>, 
			on his lips and on mine! I cannot speak or write these words 
			without unrest of spirit. His language, so familiar and so 
			foreign, will always be for me an acquired speech. I have not 
			made or accepted its words. My voice holds them at bay. My 
			soul frets in the shadow of his language. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—And to distinguish between the beautiful and the sublime, 
			the dean added. To distinguish between moral beauty and 
			material beauty. And to inquire what kind of  beauty is proper 
			to each of the various arts. These are some interesting points 
			we might take up. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Stephen, disheartened suddenly by the dean's firm dry tone, 
			was silent. The dean also was silent: and through the silence a 
			distant noise of many boots and confused voices came up the 
			staircase. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—In pursuing  these speculations, said the dean conclusively, 
			there is however the danger of perishing of inanition. 
			First you must take your degree. Set that before you as your 
			first aim. Then little by little, you will see your way. I mean in 
			every sense, your way in life and in thinking. It may be uphill 
			pedalling at first. Take Mr Moonan. He was a long time before 
			he got to the top. But he got there. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—I may not have his talent, said Stephen quietly. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—You never know, said the dean brightly. We never can 
			say what is in us. I most certainly should not be despondent. 
			Per aspera ad astra. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">He left the hearth quickly and went towards the landing to 
			oversee the arrival of the first arts' class. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Leaning against the fireplace Stephen heard him greet 
			briskly and impartially every student of the class and could 
			almost see the frank smiles of the coarser students. A desolating 
			pity began to fall like a dew upon his easily embittered 
			heart for this faithful servingman of the knightly Loyola, for 
			this halfbrother of the clergy, more venal than they in speech, 
			more steadfast of soul than they, one whom he would never 
			call his ghostly father: and he thought how this man and his 
			companions had earned the name of worldlings at the hands 
			not of the unworldly only but of the worldly also for having 
			pleaded, during all their history, at the bar of God's justice for 
			the souls of the lax and the lukewarm and the prudent. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">The entry of the professor was signalled by a few rounds of 
			<span class="hide">51.278708 0.521725</span>Kentish fire from the heavy boots of those students who sat on 
			the highest tier of the gloomy theatre under the grey cobwebbed 
			windows. The calling of the roll began and the responses 
			to the names were given out in all tones until the name 
			of Peter Byrne was reached. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Here! </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">A deep base note in response came from the upper tier, 
			followed by coughs of protest along the other benches. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">The professor paused in his reading and called the next 
			name: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Cranly! </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">No answer. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Mr Cranly! </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">A smile flew across Stephen's face as he thought of his 
			friend's studies. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Try <span class="hide">53.267776 -6.198408</span>Leopardstown! said a voice from the bench behind. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Stephen glanced up quickly but Moynihan's snoutish face, 
			outlined on the grey light, was impassive. A formula was given 
			out. Amid the rustling of the notebooks Stephen turned back 
			again and said: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Give me some paper for God's sake. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Are you as bad as that? asked Moynihan with a broad 
			grin. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">He tore a sheet from his scribbler and passed it down, 
			whispering: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—In case of necessity any layman or woman can do it. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">The formula which he wrote obediently on the sheet of 
			paper, the coiling and uncoiling calculations of the professor, 
			the spectrelike symbols of force and velocity fascinated and 
			jaded Stephen's mind. He had heard some say that the old 
			professor was an atheist freemason. O the grey dull day! It 
			seemed a limbo of painless patient consciousness through 
			which souls of mathematicians might wander, projecting long 
			slender fabrics from plane to plane of ever rarer and paler 
			twilight, radiating swift eddies to the last verges of a universe 
			ever vaster, farther and more impalpable. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—So we must distinguish between elliptical and ellipsoidal. 
			Perhaps some of you gentlemen may be familiar with the 
			works of Mr W. S. Gilbert. In one of his songs he speaks of 
			the billiard sharp who is condemned to play: </p>
		<p class="lg"><span class="tag type">song</span>
			On a cloth untrue <br>
			With a twisted cue <br>
			And elliptical billiard balls. <br>
		</p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—He means a ball having the form of the ellipsoid of the 
			principal axes of which I spoke a moment ago. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Moynihan leaned down towards Stephen's ear and murmured: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—What price ellipsoidal balls! Chase me, ladies, I'm in the 
			cavalry! </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">His fellowstudent's rude humour ran like a gust through the 
			cloister of Stephen's mind, shaking into gay life limp priestly 
			vestments that hung upon the walls, setting them to sway and 
			caper in a sabbath of misrule. The forms of the community 
			emerged from the gustblown vestments, the dean of studies, 
			the portly florid bursar with his cap of grey hair, the president, 
			the little priest with feathery hair who wrote devout verses, the 
			squat peasant form of the professor of economics, the tall 
			form of the young professor of mental science discussing on 
			the landing a case of conscience with his class like a giraffe 
			cropping high leafage among a herd of antelopes, the grave 
			troubled prefect of the sodality, the plump roundheaded 
			professor of Italian with his rogue's eyes. They came ambling 
			and stumbling, tumbling and capering, kilting their gowns for 
			leap frog, holding one another back, shaken with deep fast 
			laughter, smacking one another behind and laughing at their 
			rude malice, calling to one another by familiar nicknames, 
			protesting  with sudden dignity at some rough usage, whispering 
			two and two behind their hands. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">The professor had gone to the glass cases on the sidewall 
			from a shelf of which he took down a set of coils, blew away 
			the dust from many points and, bearing it carefully to the 
			table, held a finger on it while he proceeded with his lecture. 
			He explained that the wires in modern coils were of a compound 
			called platinoid lately discovered by F. W. Martino. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">He spoke clearly the initials and surname of the discoverer. 
			Moynihan whispered from behind: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Good old Fresh Water Martin! </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Ask him, Stephen whispered back with weary humour, if 
			he wants a subject for electrocution. He can have me. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Moynihan, seeing the professor bend over the coils, rose in 
			his bench and, clacking noiselessly the fingers of his right 
			hand, began to call with the voice of a slobbering urchin: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Please, teacher! Please, teacher! This boy is after saying a 
			bad word, teacher. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Platinoid, the professor said solemnly, is preferred to 
			German silver because it has a lower coefficient of resistance 
			variation by changes of temperature. The platinoid wire is 
			insulated and the covering of silk that insulates it is wound on 
			the ebonite bobbins just where my finger is. If it were wound 
			single an extra current would be induced in the coils. The 
			bobbins are saturated in hot paraffin wax ... </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">A sharp <span class="hide">54.407332 -7.024250</span>Ulster voice said from the bench below Stephen: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Are we  likely to be asked questions on applied science? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">The professor began to juggle gravely with the terms pure 
			science and applied science. A heavybuilt student wearing 
			gold spectacles stared with some wonder at the questioner. 
			Moynihan murmured from behind in his natural voice: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Isn't MacAlister a devil for his pound of flesh? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Stephen looked down coldly on the oblong skull beneath 
			him overgrown with tangled twinecoloured hair. The voice, 
			the accent, the mind of the questioner offended him and he 
			allowed the offence to carry  him towards wilful unkindness, 
			bidding his mind think that the student's father would have 
			done better had he sent his son to <span class="hide">54.597285 -5.930120</span>Belfast to study and have 
			saved something on the train fare by so doing. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">The oblong skull beneath did not turn to meet this shaft of 
			thought and yet the shaft came back to its bowstring: for he 
			saw in a moment the student's wheypale face. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—That thought is not mine, he said to himself quickly. It 
			came from the comic Irishman in the bench behind. Patience. 
			Can you say with certitude by whom the soul of your race was 
			bartered and its elect betrayed - by the questioner or  by the 
			mocker? Patience. Remember Epictetus. It is probably in his 
			character to ask such a question at such a moment in such a 
			tone and to pronounce the word <span class="emph">science</span> as a monosyllable. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">The droning voice of the professor continued to wind itself 
			slowly round and round the coils it spoke of, doubling, trebling, 
			quadrupling its somnolent energy as the coil multiplied 
			its ohms of resistance. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Moynihan's voice called from behind in echo to a distant 
			bell: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Closing time, gents! </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">The entrance hall was crowded and loud with talk. On a 
			table near the door were two photographs in frames and 
			between them a long roll of paper bearing an irregular tail of 
			signatures. MacCann went briskly to and fro among the students, 
			talking rapidly, answering rebuffs and leading one after 
			another to the table. In the inner hall the dean of studies stood 
			talking to a young professor, stroking his chin gravely and 
			nodding his head. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Stephen,  checked by the crowd at the door, halted irresolutely. 
			From under the wide falling leaf of a soft hat Cranly's 
			dark eyes were watching him. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Have you signed? Stephen asked. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Cranly closed his long thinlipped mouth, communed with 
			himself an instant and answered: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Ego habeo. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—What is it for? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Quod? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—What is it for? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Cranly turned his pale face to Stephen and said blandly and 
			bitterly: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Per pax universalis. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Stephen pointed to the Csar's photograph and said: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—He has the face of a besotted Christ. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">The scorn and anger in his voice brought Cranly's eyes back 
			from a calm survey of the walls of the hall. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Are you annoyed? he asked. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—No, answered Stephen. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Are you in bad humour? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—No. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Credo ut vos sanguinarius mendax estis, said Cranly, quia 
					facies vostra monstrat ut vos in damno malo humore estis.</p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Moynihan, on his way to the table, said in Stephen's ear: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—MacCann is in tiptop form. Ready to shed the last drop. 
			Brandnew world. No stimulants and votes for the bitches. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Stephen smiled at the manner of this confidence and, when 
			Moynihan had passed, turned again to meet Cranly's eyes. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Perhaps you can tell me, he said, why he pours his soul 
			so freely into my ear. Can you? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">A dull scowl appeared on Cranly's forehead. He stared at 
			the table where Moynihan had bent to write his name on the 
			roll, and then said flatly: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—A sugar! </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Quis est in malo humore, said Stephen, ego aut vos?</p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Cranly did not take up the taunt. He brooded sourly on his 
			judgment and repeated with the same flat force: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—A flaming bloody sugar, that's what he is! </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">It was his epitaph for all dead friendships and Stephen 
			wondered whether it would ever be spoken in the same tone 
			over his memory. The heavy lumpish phrase sank slowly out 
			of hearing like a stone through a quagmire. Stephen saw it 
			sink as he had seen many another, feeling its heaviness depress 
			his heart. Cranly's speech, unlike that of Davin, had 
			neither rare phrases of Elizabethan English nor quaintly turned 
			versions of Irish idioms. Its drawl was an echo of the quays of 
			Dublin given back by a bleak decaying seaport, its energy an 
			echo of the sacred eloquence of Dublin given back flatly by a 
			<span class="hide">52.979861 -6.048263</span>Wicklow pulpit. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">The heavy scowl faded from Cranly's face as MacCann 
			marched briskly towards them from the other side of the hall. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Here you are! said MacCann cheerily. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Here I am! said Stephen. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Late as usual. Can you not combine the progressive 
			tendency with a respect for punctuality? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—That question is out of order, said Stephen. Next business. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">His smiling eyes were fixed on a silverwrapped tablet of 
			milk chocolate which peeped out of the propagandist's breastpocket. 
			A little ring of listeners closed round to hear the war 
			of wits. A lean student with olive skin and lank black hair 
			thrust his face between the two, glancing from one to the other 
			at each phrase and seeming to try to catch each flying phrase 
			in his open moist mouth. Cranly took a small grey handball 
			from his pocket and began to examine it closely, turning it 
			over and over. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Next business? said MacCann. Hom! </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">He gave a loud cough of laughter, smiled broadly and 
			tugged twice at  the strawcoloured goatee which hung from his 
			blunt chin. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—The next business is to sign the testimonial. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Will you pay me anything if I sign? asked Stephen. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—I thought you were an idealist, said MacCann. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">The gipsylike student looked about him and addressed the 
			onlookers in an indistinct bleating voice. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—By hell, that's a queer notion. I consider that notion to be 
			a mercenary notion. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">His voice faded into silence. No heed was paid to his words. 
			He turned his olive face, equine in expression, towards Stephen, 
			inviting him to speak again. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">MacCann began to speak with fluent energy of the Csar's 
			rescript, of Stead, of general disarmament, arbitration in cases 
			of international disputes, of the signs of the times, of the new 
			humanity and the new gospel of life which would make it the 
			business of the community to secure as cheaply as possible 
			the greatest possible happiness of the greatest possible number. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">The gipsy student responded to the close of the period by 
			crying: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Three cheers for universal brotherhood! </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Go on, Temple, said a stout ruddy student near him. I'll 
			stand you a pint after. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—I'm a believer in universal brotherhood, said Temple, 
			glancing about him out of his dark, oval eyes. Marx is only a 
			bloody cod. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Cranly gripped his arm tightly to check his tongue, smiling 
			uneasily, and repeated: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Easy, easy, easy! </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Temple struggled to free his arm but continued, his mouth 
			flecked by a thin foam: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Socialism was founded by an Irishman and the first man 
			in Europe who preached the freedom of thought was Collins. 
			Two hundred years ago. He denounced priestcraft, the philosopher 
			of <span class="hide">51.520987 -0.415985</span>Middlesex. Three cheers for John Anthony Collins! </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">A thin voice from the verge of the ring replied: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Pip! pip! </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Moynihan murmured beside Stephen's ear: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—And what about John Anthony's poor little sister: </p>
		<p class="lg">
			Lottie Collins lost her drawers; <br>
			Won't you kindly lend her yours? <br>
		</p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Stephen laughed and Moynihan, pleased with the result, 
			murmured again: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—We'll have five bob each way on John Anthony Collins. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—I am waiting for your answer, said MacCann briefly. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—The affair doesn't interest me in the least, said Stephen 
			wearily. You know that well. Why do you make a scene about 
			it? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Good!  said MacCann, smacking his lips. You are a 
			reactionary then? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Do you think you impress me, Stephen asked, when you 
			flourish your wooden sword? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Metaphors! said MacCann bluntly. Come to facts. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Stephen blushed and turned aside. MacCann stood his 
			ground and said with hostile humour: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Minor poets, I suppose, are above such trivial questions 
			as the question of universal peace. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Cranly raised his head and held the handball between the 
			two students by way of a peaceoffering, saying: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Pax super totum sanguinarium globum. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Stephen, moving away the bystanders, jerked his shoulder 
			angrily in the direction of the Csar's image, saying: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Keep your icon. If we must have a Jesus, let us have a 
			legitimate Jesus. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—By hell, that's a good one! said the gipsy student to those 
			about him. That's a fine expression. I like that expression 
			immensely. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">He gulped down the spittle in his throat as if he were gulping 
			down the phrase and, fumbling at the peak of his tweed 
			cap, turned to Stephen, saying: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Excuse me, sir, what do you mean by that expression you 
			uttered just now? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Feeling himself jostled by the students near him, he said to 
			them: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—I am curious to know now what he meant by that expression. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">He turned again to Stephen and said in a whisper: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Do you believe in Jesus? I believe in man. Of course, I 
			don't know if you believe in man. I admire you, sir. I admire 
			the mind of man independent of all religions. Is that your 
			opinion about the mind of Jesus? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Go on, Temple, said the stout ruddy student, returning, 
			as was his wont, to his first idea, that pint is waiting for you. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—He thinks I'm an imbecile, Temple explained to Stephen, 
			because I'm a  believer in the power of mind. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Cranly linked his arms into those of Stephen and his admirer 
			and said: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Nos ad manum ballum jocabimus.</p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Stephen, in the act of being led away, caught sight of MacCann's 
			flushed bluntfeatured face. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—My signature is of no account, he said politely. You are 
			right to go your way. Leave me to go mine. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Dedalus, said MacCann crisply, I believe you're a good 
			fellow but you have yet to learn the dignity of altruism and the 
			responsibility of the human individual. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">A voice said: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Intellectual crankery is better out of this movement than 
			in it. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Stephen, recognising  the harsh tone of MacAlister's voice, 
			did not turn in the direction of the voice. Cranly pushed solemnly 
			through the throng of students, linking Stephen and 
			Temple like a celebrant attended by his ministers on his way 
			to the altar. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Temple bent eagerly across Cranly's breast and said: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Did you hear MacAlister what he said? That youth is 
			jealous of you. Did you see that? I bet Cranly didn't see that. 
			By hell, I saw that at once. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">As they crossed the inner hall the dean of studies was in  the 
			act of escaping from the student with whom he had been 
			conversing. He stood at the foot of the staircase, a foot on the 
			lowest step, his threadbare  soutane gathered about him for the 
			ascent with womanish care, nodding his head often and repeating: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Not a doubt of it, Mr Hackett! Very fine! Not a doubt of 
			it! </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">In the middle of the hall the prefect of the college sodality 
			was speaking earnestly, in a soft querulous voice, with a 
			boarder. As he spoke he wrinkled a little his freckled brow 
			and bit, between his phrases, at a tiny bone pencil. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—I hope the matric men will all come. The first arts men 
			are pretty sure. Second arts too. We must make sure of the 
			newcomers. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Temple bent again across Cranly, as they were passing 
			through the doorway, and said in a swift whisper: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Do you know that he is a married man? He was a married 
			man before they converted him. He has a wife and children 
			somewhere. By hell, I think that's the queerest notion I 
			ever heard! Eh? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">His whisper trailed off into sly cackling laughter. The moment 
			they were through the doorway Cranly seized him rudely 
			by the neck and shook him, saying: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—You flaming floundering fool! I'll take my dying bible 
			there isn't a bigger bloody ape, do you know, than you in the 
			whole flaming bloody world! </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Temple wriggled in his grip, laughing still with sly content, 
			while Cranly repeated flatly at every rude shake: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—A flaming flaring  bloody idiot! </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">They crossed the weedy garden together. The president, 
			wrapped in a heavy loose cloak, was coming towards them 
			along one of the walks, reading his office. At the end of the 
			walk he halted before turning and raised his eyes. The students 
			saluted, Temple fumbling as before at the peak of his 
			cap. They walked forward in silence. As they neared the alley 
			Stephen could hear the thuds of the players' hands and the wet 
			smacks of the ball and Davin's voice crying out excitedly at 
			each stroke. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">The three students halted round the box on which Davin sat 
			to follow the game. Temple, after a few moments, sidled 
			across to Stephen and said: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Excuse me, I wanted to ask you do you believe that Jean 
			Jacques Rousseau was a sincere man? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Stephen laughed outright. Cranly, picking up the broken 
			stave of a cask from the grass at his foot, turned swiftly and 
			said sternly: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Temple, I declare to the living God if you say another 
			word, do you know, to anybody on any subject I'll kill you 
			super spottum. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—He was like you, I fancy, said Stephen, an emotional 
			man. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Blast him, curse him! said Cranly broadly. Don't talk to 
			him at all. Sure, you might as well be talking, do you know, to 
			a flaming chamberpot as talking to Temple. Go home, Temple. 
			For God's sake, go home. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—I don't care a damn about you, Cranly, answered Temple, 
			moving out of reach of the uplifted stave and pointing at 
			Stephen. He's the only man I see in this institution that has an 
			individual mind. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Institution! Individual! cried Cranly. Go home, blast you, 
			for you're a hopeless bloody man. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—I'm an emotional man, said Temple. That's quite rightly 
			expressed. And I'm proud that I'm an emotionalist. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">He sidled out of the alley, smiling slily. Cranly watched him 
			with a blank expressionless face. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Look at him! he said. Did you ever see such a go-by-the-wall? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">His phrase was greeted by a strange laugh from a student 
			who lounged against the wall, his peaked cap down on his eyes. 
			The laugh, pitched in a high key and coming from a so muscular 
			frame, seemed like the whinny of an elephant. The student's 
			body shook all over and, to ease his mirth, he rubbed 
			both his hands delightedly, over  his groins. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Lynch is awake, said Cranly. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Lynch, for answer, straightened himself and thrust forward 
			his chest. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Lynch puts out his chest, said Stephen, as a criticism of 
			life. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Lynch smote himself sonorously on the chest and said: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Who has anything to say about my girth? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Cranly took him at the word and the two began to tussle. 
			When their faces had flushed with the struggle they drew 
			apart, panting. Stephen bent down towards Davin who, intent 
			on the game, had paid no heed to the talk of the others. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—And how is my little tame goose? he asked. Did he sign 
			too? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Davin nodded and said: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—And you, Stevie? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Stephen shook his head. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—You're a terrible man, Stevie, said Davin, taking the 
			short pipe from his mouth. Always alone. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Now that you have signed the petition for universal 
			peace, said Stephen, I suppose you will burn that little copybook 
			I saw in your room. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">As Davin did not answer Stephen began to quote: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Long pace, fianna! Right incline, fianna! Fianna, by 
			numbers, salute, one, two! </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—That's a different question, said Davin. I'm an Irish 
			nationalist, first and foremost. But that's you all out. You're 
			a born sneerer, Stevie. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—When you make the next rebellion with hurleysticks, said 
			Stephen, and want the indispensable informer, tell me. I can 
			find you a few in this college. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—I can't understand you, said Davin. One time I hear you 
			talk against English literature. Now you talk against the  Irish 
			informers. What with your name and your ideas ... Are 
			you Irish at all? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Come with me now to the office of arms and I will show 
			you the tree of my family, said Stephen. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Then be one of us, said Davin. Why don't you learn 
			Irish? Why did you drop out of the league class after the first 
			lesson? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—You know one reason why, answered Stephen. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Davin tossed his head and laughed. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—O, come now, he said. Is it on account of that certain 
			young lady and Father Moran? But that's all in your own 
			mind, Stevie. They were only talking and laughing. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Stephen paused and laid a friendly hand upon Davin's 
			shoulder. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Do you remember, he said, when we knew each other 
			first? The first morning we met you asked me to show you the 
			way to the matriculation class, putting a very strong stress on 
			the first syllable. You remember? Then you used to address 
			the jesuits as father, you remember? I ask myself about you: 
			<span class="emph">Is he as innocent as his speech?</span> </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—I'm a simple person, said Davin. You know that. When 
			you told me that night in Harcourt Street those things about 
			your private life, honest to God, Stevie, I was not able to eat 
			my dinner. I was quite bad. I was awake a long time that 
			night. Why did you tell me those things? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Thanks, said Stephen. You mean I am a monster. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—No, said Davin, but I wish you had not told me. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">A tide began to surge beneath the calm surface of Stephen's 
			friendliness. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—This race and this country and this life produced me, he 
			said. I shall express myself as I am. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Try to be one of us, repeated Davin. In your heart you 
			are an Irishman but your pride is too powerful. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—My ancestors threw off their language and took another, 
			Stephen said. They allowed a handful of foreigners to subject 
			them. Do you fancy I am going to pay in my own life and 
			person debts they made? What for? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—For our freedom, said Davin. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—No honourable and sincere man, said Stephen, has given 
			up to you his life and his youth and his affections from the 
			days of Tone to those of Parnell but you sold him to the 
			enemy or failed him in need or reviled him and left him for 
			another. And you invite me to be one of you. I'd see you 
			damned first. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—They died for their ideals, Stevie, said Davin. Our day 
			will come yet, believe me. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Stephen, following his own thought, was silent for an instant. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—The soul is born, he said vaguely, first in those moments 
			I told you of. It has a slow and dark birth, more mysterious 
			than  the birth of the body. When the soul of a man is born in 
			this country there are nets flung at it to hold it back from 
			flight. You talk to me of nationality, language, religion. I shall 
			try to fly by those nets. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Davin knocked the ashes from his pipe. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Too deep for me, Stevie, he said. But a man's country 
			comes first. Ireland first, Stevie. You can be a poet or mystic 
			after. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Do you know what Ireland is? asked Stephen with cold 
			violence. Ireland is the old sow that eats her farrow. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Davin rose from his box and went towards the players, 
			shaking his head sadly. But in a moment his sadness left him 
			and he was hotly disputing with Cranly and the two players 
			who had finished their game. A match of four was arranged, 
			Cranly insisting, however, that his ball should be used. He let 
			it rebound twice or thrice to his hand and struck it strongly 
			and swiftly towards the base of the alley, exclaiming in answer 
			to its thud: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Your soul! </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Stephen stood with Lynch till the score began to rise. Then 
			he plucked him by the sleeve to come away. Lynch obeyed, 
			saying: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Let us eke go, as Cranly has it. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Stephen smiled at this sidethrust. They passed back through 
			the garden and out through the hall where the doddering 
			porter was pinning up a notice in the frame. At the foot of the 
			steps they halted and Stephen took a packet of cigarettes from 
			his pocket and offered it to his companion. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—I know you are poor, he said. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Damn your yellow insolence, answered Lynch. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">This second proof of Lynch's culture made Stephen smile 
			again. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—It was a great day for European culture, he said, when 
			you made up your mind to swear in yellow. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">They lit their cigarettes and turned to the right. After a 
			pause Stephen began: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Aristotle has not defined pity and terror. I have. I 
			say ... </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Lynch halted and said bluntly: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Stop! I won't listen! I am sick. I was out last night on a 
			yellow drunk with Horan and Goggins. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Stephen went on: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Pity is the feeling which arrests the mind in the presence 
			of whatsoever is grave and constant in human sufferings and 
			unites it with the human sufferer.  Terror is the feeling which 
			arrests the mind in the presence of whatsoever is grave and 
			constant in human sufferings and unites it with the secret 
			cause. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Repeat, said Lynch. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Stephen repeated the definitions slowly. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—A girl got into a hansom a few days ago, he went on, in 
			<span class="hide">51.507351 -0.127758</span>London. She was on her way to meet her mother whom she 
			had not seen for many years. At the corner of a street the shaft 
			of a lorry shivered the window of the hansom in the shape of a 
			star. A long fine needle of the shivered glass pierced her heart. 
			She died on the instant. The reporter called it a tragic death. It 
			is not. It is remote from terror and pity according to the terms 
			of my definitions. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—The tragic emotion, in fact, is a face looking two ways, 
			towards terror and towards pity, both of which are phases of 
			it. You see I use the word <span class="emph">arrest</span>. I mean that the tragic emotion 
			is static. Or rather the dramatic emotion is. The feelings 
			excited by improper art are kinetic, desire or loathing. Desire 
			urges us to possess, to go to something; loathing  urges us to 
			abandon, to go from something. These are kinetic emotions. 
			The arts which excite them, pornographical or didactic, are 
			therefore improper arts. The esthetic emotion (I use the 
			general term) is therefore static. The mind is arrested and 
			raised above desire and loathing. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—You say that art must not excite desire, said Lynch. I 
			told you that one day I wrote my name in pencil on the backside 
			of the Venus of Praxiteles in the <span class="hide">53.339706 -6.252188</span>Museum. Was that not 
			desire? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—I speak of normal natures, said Stephen. You also told 
			me that when you were a boy in that charming carmelite 
			school you ate pieces of dried cowdung. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Lynch broke again into a whinny of laughter and again 
			rubbed both his hands over his groins but without taking them 
			from his pockets. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—O I did! I did! he cried. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Stephen turned towards his companion and looked at him 
			for a moment boldly in the eyes. Lynch, recovering from his 
			laughter, answered his look from his humbled eyes. The long 
			slender flattened skull beneath the long pointed cap brought 
			before Stephen's mind the image of a hooded reptile. The 
			eyes, too, were reptilelike in glint and gaze. Yet at that instant, 
			humbled and alert in their look, they were lit by one tiny 
			human point, the window of a shrivelled soul, poignant and 
			selfembittered. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—As for that, Stephen said in polite parenthesis, we are all 
			animals. I also am an animal. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—You are, said Lynch. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—But we are just now in a mental world, Stephen continued. 
			The desire and loathing excited by improper esthetic 
			means are really unesthetic emotions not only because they 
			are kinetic in character but also because they are not more 
			than physical. Our flesh shrinks from what it dreads and 
			responds to the stimulus of what it desires by a purely reflex 
			action of the nervous system. Our eyelid closes before we are 
			aware that the fly is about to enter our eye. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Not always, said Lynch critically. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—In the same way, said Stephen, your flesh responded to 
			the stimulus of a naked statue but it was, I say, simply a reflex 
			action of the nerves. Beauty expressed by the artist cannot 
			awaken in us an emotion which is kinetic or a sensation which 
			is purely physical. It awakens, or ought to awaken, or induces, 
			or ought to induce, an esthetic stasis, an ideal pity or an ideal 
			terror, a stasis called forth, prolonged and at last dissolved by 
			what I call the rhythm of beauty. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—What is that exactly? asked Lynch. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Rhythm, said Stephen, is the first formal esthetic relation 
			of part to part in any esthetic whole or of an esthetic whole to 
			its part or parts or of any part to the esthetic whole of which it 
			is a part. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—If that is rhythm, said Lynch, let me hear what you call 
			beauty: and, please remember, though I did eat a cake of 
			cowdung once, that I admire only beauty. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Stephen raised his cap as if in greeting. Then,  blushing 
			slightly, he laid his hand on Lynch's thick tweed sleeve. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—We are right, he said, and the others are wrong. To speak 
			of these things and to try to understand their nature and, 
			having understood it, to try slowly and humbly and constantly 
			to express, to press out again, from the gross earth or what it 
			brings forth, from sound and shape and colour which are the 
			prison gates of our soul, an image of the beauty we have come 
			to understand - that is art. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">They had reached the <span class="hide">53.342399 -6.238434</span>canal bridge and, turning from their 
			course, went on by the trees. A crude grey light, mirrored in 
			the sluggish water, and a smell of wet branches over their 
			heads seemed to war against the course of Stephen's thought. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—But you have not answered my question, said Lynch. 
			What is art? What is the beauty it expresses? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—That was the first definition I gave you, you sleepyheaded 
			wretch, said Stephen, when I began to try to think out 
			the matter for myself. Do you remember the night? Cranly 
			lost his temper and began to talk about Wicklow bacon. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—I remember, said Lynch. He told us about them flaming 
			fat devils of pigs. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Art, said Stephen, is the human disposition of sensible or 
			intelligible matter for an esthetic end. You remember the pigs 
			and forget that. You are a distressing pair, you and Cranly. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Lynch made a grimace at the raw grey sky and said: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—If I am to listen to your esthetic philosophy give me at 
			least another cigarette. I don't care about it. I don't even care 
			about women. Damn you and damn everything. I want a job 
			of five hundred a year. You can't get me one. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Stephen handed him the packet of cigarettes. Lynch took the 
			last one that remained, saying simply: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Proceed! </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Aquinas, said Stephen, says that is beautiful the apprehension 
			of which pleases. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Lynch nodded. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—I remember that, he said. Pulcra sunt quae visa placent.</p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—He uses the word visa, said Stephen, to cover esthetic 
			apprehensions of all kinds, whether through sight or hearing 
			or through any other avenue of apprehension. This word, 
			though it is vague, is clear enough to keep away good and evil 
			which excite desire and loathing. It means certainly a stasis 
			and not a kinesis. How about the true? It produces also a 
			stasis of the mind. You would not write your name in pencil 
			across the hypothenuse of a rightangled triangle. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—No, said Lynch, give me the hypothenuse of the Venus of 
			Praxiteles. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Static therefore, said Stephen. Plato, I believe, said that 
			beauty is the splendour of truth. I don't think that it has a 
			meaning but the true and the beautiful are akin. Truth is 
			beheld by the intellect which is appeased by the most satisfying 
			relations of the intelligible:  beauty is beheld by the imagination 
			which is appeased by the most satisfying relations of 
			the sensible. The first step in the direction of truth is to 
			understand the frame and scope of the intellect itself, to comprehend 
			the act itself of intellection. Aristotle's entire system of 
			philosophy rests upon his book of psychology and that, I 
			think, rests on his statement that the same attribute cannot at 
			the same time and in the same connection belong to and not 
			belong to the same subject. The first step in the direction of 
			beauty is to understand the frame and scope of the imagination, 
			to comprehend the act itself of esthetic apprehension. Is 
			that clear? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—But what is beauty? asked Lynch impatiently. Out with 
			another definition. Something we see and like! Is that the best 
			you and Aquinas can do? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Let us take woman, said Stephen. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Let us take her! said Lynch fervently. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—The Greek, the Turk, the Chinese, the Copt, the Hottentot, 
			said Stephen, all admire a different type of female beauty. 
			That seems to be a maze out of which we cannot escape. I see 
			however two ways out. One is this hypothesis: that every 
			physical quality admired by men in women is in direct connection 
			with the manifold functions of women for the propagation 
			of the species. It may be so. The world, it seems, is drearier 
			than even you, Lynch, imagined. For my part I dislike that 
			way out. It leads to eugenics rather than to esthetic. It leads 
			you out of the maze into a new gaudy lectureroom where MacCann, 
			with one hand on <span class="emph">The Origin of Species</span> and the other 
			hand on the new testament, tells you that you admired the 
			great flanks of Venus because you felt that she would bear you 
			burly offspring and admired her great breasts because you felt 
			that she would give  good milk to her children and yours. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Then MacCann is a sulphuryellow liar, said Lynch 
			energetically. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—There remains another way out, said Stephen, laughing. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—To wit? said Lynch. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—This hypothesis, Stephen began. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">A long dray laden with old iron came round the corner of 
			<span class="hide">53.339029 -6.241523</span>sir Patrick Dun's hospital covering the end of Stephen's 
			speech with the harsh roar of jangled and rattling metal. 
			Lynch closed his ears and gave out oath after oath till the dray 
			had passed. Then he turned on his heel rudely. Stephen turned 
			also and waited for a few moments till his companion's illhumour 
			had had its vent. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—This hypothesis, Stephen repeated, is the other way out: 
			that, though the same object may not seem beautiful to all 
			people, all people who admire a beautiful object find in it 
			certain relations which satisfy and coincide with the stages 
			themselves of all esthetic apprehension. These relations of the 
			sensible, visible to you through one form and to me through 
			another, must be therefore the necessary qualities of beauty. 
			Now, we can return to our old friend saint Thomas for another 
			pennyworth of wisdom. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Lynch laughed. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—It amuses me vastly, he said, to hear you quoting him 
			time after time like a jolly round friar. Are you laughing in 
			your sleeve? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—MacAlister, answered Stephen, would call my esthetic 
			theory applied Aquinas. So far as this side of esthetic philosophy 
			extends Aquinas will carry me all along the line. When we 
			come to the phenomena of artistic conception, artistic gestation 
			and artistic reproduction I require a new terminology and 
			a new personal experience. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Of course, said Lynch. After all Aquinas, in spite of his 
			intellect,  was exactly a good round  friar. But you will tell me 
			about the new personal experience and new terminology some 
			other day. Hurry up and finish the first part. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Who knows? said Stephen, smiling. Perhaps Aquinas 
			would understand me better than you. He was a poet himself. 
			He wrote a hymn for Maundy Thursday. It begins with the 
			words Pange lingua gloriosi. They say it is the highest glory 
			of the hymnal. It is an intricate and soothing hymn.  I like it: 
			but there is no hymn that can be put beside that mournful and 
			majestic processional song, the Vexilla Regis of Venantius 
			Fortunatus. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Lynch began to sing softly and solemnly in a deep bass 
			voice: </p>

		<p class="lg"><span class="tag type">song</span>
				Impleta sunt quae concinit <br>
				David fideli carmine <br>
				Dicendo nationibus <br>
				Regnavit a ligno Deus. <br>
		</p>

		<p class="textParagraph">—That's great! he said, well pleased. Great music! </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">They turned into <span class="hide">53.338573 -6.243389</span>Lower Mount Street. A few steps from the 
			corner a fat young man, wearing a silk neckcloth, saluted them 
			and stopped. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Did you hear the results of the exams? he asked. Griffin 
			was plucked. Halpin and O'Flynn are through the home civil. 
			Moonan got fifth place in the Indian. O'Shaughnessy got 
			fourteenth. The Irish fellows in Clarke's gave them a feed last 
			night. They all ate curry. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">His pallid bloated face expressed benevolent malice and, as 
			he had advanced through his tidings of success, his small 
			fatencircled eyes vanished out of sight and his weak wheezing 
			voice out of hearing. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">In reply to a question of Stephen's his eyes and his voice 
			came forth again from their lurkingplaces. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Yes, MacCullagh and I, he said. He's taking pure mathematics 
			and I'm taking constitutional history. There are twenty 
			subjects. I'm taking botany too. You know I'm a member of 
			the field club. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">He drew back from the other two in a stately fashion and 
			placed a plump woollengloved hand on his breast, from which 
			muttered wheezing laughter at once broke forth. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Bring us a few turnips and onions the next time you go 
			out, said Stephen drily, to make a stew. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">The fat student laughed indulgently and said: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—We are all  highly respectable people in the field club. 
			Last Saturday we went out to <span class="hide">52.957720 -6.354370</span>Glenmalure, seven of us. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—With women, Donovan? said Lynch. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Donovan again laid his hand on his chest and said: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Our end is the acquisition of knowledge. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Then he said quickly: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—I hear you are writing some essay about esthetics. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Stephen made a vague gesture of denial. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Goethe and Lessing, said Donovan, have written a lot on 
			that subject, the classical school and the romantic school and 
			all that. The <span class="emph">Laocoon</span> interested me very much when I read it. 
			Of course it is idealistic, German, ultraprofound. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Neither of the others spoke. Donovan took leave of them 
			urbanely. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—I must go, he said softly and benevolently. I have a 
			strong suspicion, amounting almost to a conviction, that my 
			sister intended to make pancakes today for the dinner of the 
			Donovan family. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Goodbye, Stephen said in his wake. Don't forget the 
			turnips for me and my mate. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Lynch gazed after him, his lip curling in slow scorn till his 
			face resembled a devil's mask: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—To think that that yellow pancakeeating excrement can 
			get a good job, he said at length, and I have to smoke cheap 
			cigarettes! </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">They turned their faces towards <span class="hide">53.339658 -6.249165</span>Merrion Square and went 
			on for a little in silence. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—To finish what I was saying about beauty, said Stephen, 
			the most satisfying relations of the sensible must therefore 
			correspond to the necessary phases of artistic apprehension. 
			Find these and you find the qualities of universal beauty. 
			Aquinas says: ad pulcritudinem tria requiruntur, integritas, 
			consonantia, claritas. I translate it so: <span class="emph">Three things are needed 
			for beauty, wholeness, harmony and radiance</span>. Do these correspond 
			to the phases of apprehension? Are you following? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Of course, I am, said Lynch. If you think I have an 
			excrementitious intelligence run after Donovan and ask him to 
			listen to you. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Stephen pointed to a basket which a butcher's boy had 
			slung inverted on his head. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Look at that basket, he said. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—I see it, said Lynch. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—In order to see that basket, said Stephen, your mind first 
			of all separates the basket from the rest of the visible universe 
			which is not the basket. The first phase of apprehension is a 
			bounding line drawn about the object to be apprehended. An 
			esthetic image is presented to us either in space or in time. 
			What is audible is presented in time, what is visible is presented 
			in space. But, temporal or spatial, the esthetic image is 
			first luminously apprehended as selfbounded and selfcontained 
			upon the immeasurable background of space or time 
			which is not it. You apprehend it as &gt; thing. You see it as 
			one whole. You apprehend its wholeness. That is integritas. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Bull's eye! said Lynch, laughing. Go on. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Then, said Stephen, you pass from point to point, led by 
			its formal lines; you apprehend it as balanced part against part 
			within its limits; you feel the rhythm of its structure. In other 
			words the synthesis of immediate perception is followed by 
			the analysis of apprehension. Having first felt that it is &gt; 
			thing you feel now that it is a <span class="emph">thing</span>. You apprehend it as 
			complex, multiple, divisible, separable, made up of its parts, 
			the result of its parts and their sum, harmonious. That is 
			consonantia.</p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Bull's eye again! said Lynch wittily. Tell me now what is 
			claritas and you win the cigar. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—The connotation of the word, Stephen said, is rather 
			vague. Aquinas uses a term which seems to be inexact. It 
			baffled me for a long time. It would lead you to believe that 
			he had in mind symbolism or idealism, the supreme quality of 
			beauty being a light from some other world, the idea of which 
			the matter is but the shadow, the reality of which it is but the 
			symbol. I thought he might mean that claritas is the artistic 
			discovery and representation of the divine purpose in anything 
			or a force of generalisation which would make the esthetic 
			image a universal one, make it outshine its proper conditions. 
			But that is literary talk. I understand it so. When you have 
			apprehended that basket as one thing and have then  analysed 
			it according to its form and apprehended it as a thing you 
			make the only synthesis which is logically and esthetically 
			permissible. You see that it is that thing which it is and no 
			other thing. The radiance of which he speaks is the scholastic 
			quidditas, the <span class="emph">whatness</span> of a thing. This supreme quality is 
			felt by the artist when the esthetic image is first conceived in his 
			imagination. The mind in that mysterious instant Shelley 
			likened beautifully to a fading coal. The instant wherein that 
			supreme quality of beauty, the clear radiance of the esthetic 
			image, is apprehended luminously by the mind which has been 
			arrested by its wholeness and fascinated by its harmony is the 
			luminous silent stasis of esthetic pleasure, a spiritual state very 
			like to that cardiac condition which the Italian physiologist 
			Luigi Galvani, using a phrase almost as beautiful as Shelley's, 
			called the enchantment of the heart. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Stephen paused and, though his companion did not speak, 
			felt that his words had called up around them a thoughtenchanted 
			silence. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—What I have said, he began again, refers to beauty in the 
			wider sense of the word, in the sense which the word has in 
			the literary tradition. In the marketplace it has another sense. 
			When we speak of beauty in the second sense of the term our 
			judgment is influenced in the first place by the art itself and by 
			the form of that art. The image, it is clear, must be set between 
			the mind or senses of the  artist himself and the mind or 
			senses of others. If you bear this in memory you will see that 
			art necessarily divides itself into three forms progressing from 
			one to the next. These forms are: the lyrical form, the form 
			wherein the artist presents his image in immediate relation to 
			himself; the epical form, the form wherein he presents his 
			image in mediate relation to himself and to others; the dramatic 
			form, the form wherein he presents his image in immediate 
			relation to others. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—That you told me a few nights ago, said Lynch, and we 
			began the famous discussion. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—I have a book at home, said Stephen, in which I have 
			written down questions which are more amusing than yours 
			were. In finding the answers to them I found the theory of 
			esthetic which I am trying to explain. Here are some questions 
			I set myself: <span class="emph">Is a chair finely made tragic or comic? Is the 
			portrait of Mona Lisa good if I desire to see it? Is the bust of
			Sir Philip Crampton lyrical, epical or dramatic? Can excrement 
			or a child or a louse be a work of art? If not, why not?</span> </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Why not, indeed? said Lynch, laughing. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—<span class="emph">If a man hacking in fury at a block of wood</span>, Stephen 
			continued, <span class="emph">of art? If not, why not?</span> </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—That's a lovely one, said  Lynch, laughing again. That has 
			the true scholastic stink. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Lessing, said Stephen, should not have taken a group of 
			statues to write of. The art, being inferior, does not present the 
			forms I spoke of distinguished clearly one from another. Even 
			in literature, the highest and most spiritual art, the forms are 
			often confused. The lyrical form is in fact the simplest verbal 
			vesture of an instant of emotion, a rhythmical cry such as ages 
			ago cheered on the man who pulled at the oar or dragged 
			stones up a slope. He who utters it is more conscious of the 
			instant of emotion than of himself as feeling emotion. The 
			simplest epical form is seen emerging out of lyrical literature 
			when the artist prolongs and broods upon himself as the 
			centre of an epical event and this form progresses till the 
			centre of emotional gravity is equidistant from the artist 
			himself and from others. The narrative is no longer purely 
			personal. The personality of the artist passes into the narration 
			itself, flowing round and round the persons and the action 
			like a vital sea. This progress you will see easily in that old 
			English ballad which begins in the first person 
			and ends in the third person. The dramatic form is reached 
			when the vitality which has flowed and eddied round each 
			person fills every person with such vital force that he or she 
			assumes a proper and intangible esthetic life. The personality 
			of the artist, at first a cry or a cadence or a mood and then 
			a fluid and lambent narrative, finally refines itself out of existence, 
			impersonalises itself, so to speak. The esthetic image in 
			the dramatic form is life purified in and reprojected from the 
			human imagination. The mystery of esthetic like that of material 
			creation is accomplished. The artist, like the God of the 
			creation, remains within or behind or beyond or above his 
			handiwork, invisible, refined out of existence, indifferent, 
			paring his fingernails. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Trying to refine them also out of existence, said Lynch. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">A fine rain began to fall from the high veiled sky and they 
			turned into the duke's lawn, to reach <span class="hide">53.341522 -6.254893</span>the national library
			before the shower came. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—What do you mean, Lynch asked surlily, by prating 
			about beauty and the imagination in this miserable Godforsaken 
			island? No wonder the artist retired within or behind

		<p class="textParagraph">The rain fell faster. When they passed through the passage 
			beside the <span class="hide">53.340762 -6.258382</span>royal Irish academy they found many students 
			sheltering under the arcade of the library. Cranly, leaning 
			against a pillar, was picking his teeth with a sharpened match, 
			listening to some companions. Some girls stood near the 
			entrance door. Lynch whispered to Stephen: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Your beloved is  here. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Stephen took his place silently on the step below the group 
			of students, heedless of the rain which fell fast, turning his 
			eyes towards her  from time to time. She too stood silently 
			among her companions. She has no priest to flirt with, he 
			thought with conscious bitterness, remembering how he had 
			seen her last. Lynch was right. His mind, emptied of theory 
			and courage, lapsed back into a listless peace. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">He heard the students talking among themselves. They 
			spoke of two friends who had passed the final medical examination, 
			of the chances of getting places on ocean liners, of 
			poor and rich practices. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—That's all a  bubble. An Irish country practice is better. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Hynes was two years in <span class="hide">53.408371 -2.991573</span>Liverpool and he says the same. 
			A frightful hole he said it was. Nothing but midwifery cases. 
			Half a crown cases. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Do you mean to say it is better to have a job here in the 
			country than in a rich city like that? I know a fellow ... </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Hynes has no brains. He got through by stewing, pure 
			stewing. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Don't mind him. There's  plenty of money to be made in a 
			big commercial city. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Depends on the practice. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Ego credo ut vita pauperum est simpliciter atrox, simpliciter 
			sanguinarius atrox, in Liverpoolio. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Their voices reached his ears as if from a distance in interrupted 
			pulsation. She was preparing to go away with her 
			companions. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">The quick light shower had drawn off, tarrying in clusters of 
			diamonds among the shrubs of the quadrangle where an 
			exhalation  was breathed forth by the blackened earth. Their 
			trim boots prattled as they stood on the steps of the colonnade, 
			talking quietly and gaily, glancing at the clouds, holding 
			their umbrellas at cunning angles against the few last raindrops, 
			closing them again, holding their skirts demurely. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">And if he had judged her harshly? If her life were a simple 
			rosary of hours, her life simple and strange as a bird's life, gay 
			in the morning, restless all day, tired at sundown? Her heart 
			simple and wilful  as a bird's heart? </p>

		

	  

	 

		<p class="textParagraph">Towards dawn he awoke. O what sweet music! His soul 
			was all dewy wet. Over his limbs in sleep pale cool waves of 
			light had passed. He lay still, as if his soul lay amid cool waters, 
			conscious of faint sweet music. His mind was waking 
			slowly to a tremulous morning knowledge, a morning inspiration. 
			A spirit filled him, pure as the purest water, sweet as 
			dew, moving as music. But how faintly it was inbreathed, how 
			passionlessly, as if the seraphim themselves were breathing 
			upon him! His soul was waking slowly, fearing to awake 
			wholly. It was that windless hour of dawn when madness 
			wakes and strange plants open to the light and the moth flies 
			forth silently. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">An enchantment of the heart! The night had been enchanted. 
			In a dream or vision he had known the ecstasy of 
			seraphic life. Was it an instant of enchantment only or long 
			hours and days and years and ages? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">The instant of inspiration seemed now to be reflected from 
			all sides at once from a multitude of cloudy circumstance of 
			what had happened or of what might have happened. The 
			instant flashed forth like a point of light and now from cloud 
			on cloud of vague circumstance confused form  was veiling 
			softly its afterglow. O! In the virgin womb of the imagination 
			the word was made flesh. Gabriel the  seraph had come to the 
			virgin's chamber. An afterglow deepened within his spirit, 
			whence the white flame had passed, deepening to a rose and 
			ardent light. That rose and ardent light was her strange wilful 
			heart, strange that no man had known or would know, wilful 
			from before the beginning of the world: and lured by that 
			ardent roselike glow the choirs of the seraphim were falling 
			from heaven. </p>
		<p class="lg">
			Are you not weary of ardent ways, <br>
			Lure of the fallen seraphim? <br>
			Tell no more of enchanted days. <br>
		</p>
		<p class="textParagraph">The verses passed from his mind to his lips and, murmuring 
			them over, he felt the rhythmic movement of a villanelle pass 
			through them. The roselike glow sent forth its rays of rhyme; 
			ways, days, blaze, praise, raise. Its rays burned up the world, 
			consumed the hearts of men and angels: the rays from the 
			rose that was her wilful heart. </p>
		<p class="lg">
			Your eyes have set man's heart ablaze <br>
			And you have had your will of him. <br>
			Are you not weary of ardent ways? <br>
		</p>
		<p class="textParagraph">And then? The rhythm died away, ceased, began again to 
			move and beat. And then? Smoke, incense ascending from the 
			altar of the world. </p>
		<p class="lg">
			Above the flame the smoke of praise <br>
			Goes up from ocean rim to rim. <br>
			Tell no more of enchanted days. <br>
		</p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Smoke went up from the whole earth, from the vapoury 
			oceans, smoke of her praise. The earth was like a swinging 
			smoking swaying censer, a ball of incense, an ellipsoidal ball. 
			The rhythm died out at once; the cry of his heart was broken. 
			His lips began to murmur the first verses over and over; then 
			went on stumbling through half verses, stammering and 
			baffled; then stopped. The heart's cry was broken. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">The veiled windless hour had passed and behind the panes 
			of the naked window the morning light was gathering. A bell 
			beat faintly very far away. A bird twittered; two birds, three. 
			The bell and the bird ceased: and the dull white light  spread 
			itself east and west, covering the world, covering the roselight 
			in his heart. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Fearing to lose all, he raised himself suddenly on his elbow 
			to look for paper and pencil. There was neither on the table; 
			only the soupplate he had eaten the rice from for supper and 
			the candlestick with its tendrils of tallow and its paper socket, 
			singed by the last flame. He stretched his arm wearily towards 
			the foot of the bed, groping with his hand in the pockets of the 
			coat that hung there. His fingers found a pencil and then a 
			cigarette packet.  He  lay back and, tearing open the packet, 
			placed the last cigarette on the windowledge and began to 
			write out the stanzas of the villanelle in small neat letters on 
			the rough cardboard surface. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Having written them out he lay back on the lumpy pillow, 
			murmuring them again. The lumps of knotted flock under his 
			head reminded him of the lumps of knotted horsehair in the 
			sofa of her parlour on which he used to sit, smiling or serious, 
			asking himself why he had come, displeased with her and with 
			himself, confounded by the print of the Sacred Heart above 
			the untenanted sideboard. He saw her approach him in a lull 
			of the talk and beg him to sing one of his curious songs. Then 
			he saw himself sitting at the old piano, striking chords softly 
			from its speckled keys and singing, amid the talk which had 
			risen again in the room, to her who leaned beside the mantelpiece 
			a dainty song of the Elizabethans, a sad and sweet loth 
			to depart, the victory chant of Agincourt, the happy air of 
			Greensleeves. While he sang and she listened, or feigned to 
			listen, his heart was at rest but when the quaint old songs had 
			ended and he heard again the voices in the room he remembered 
			his own sarcasm: the house where young men are called 
			by their christian names a little too soon. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">At certain instants her eyes seemed about to trust him but 
			he had waited in vain. She passed now dancing lightly across 
			his memory as she had been that night at the carnival ball, her 
			white dress a little lifted, a white spray nodding in her hair. 
			She danced lightly in the round. She was dancing towards him 
			and, as she came, her eyes were a little averted and a faint 
			glow was on her cheek. At the pause in the chain of hands her 
			hand had lain in his an instant, a soft merchandise. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—You are a great stranger now. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Yes. I was born to be a monk. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—I am afraid you are a heretic. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Are you much afraid? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">For answer she had danced away from him along the chain 
			of hands, dancing lightly and discreetly, giving herself to none. 
			The white spray nodded to her dancing and when she was in 
			shadow the glow was deeper on her cheek. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">A monk! His own image started forth a profaner of the 
			cloister, a heretic franciscan, willing and willing not to serve, 
			spinning like Gherardino da Borgo San Donnino, a lithe web 
			of sophistry and whispering in her ear. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">No, it was not his image. It was like the image of the young 
			priest in whose company he had seen her last, looking at him 
			out of dove's eyes, toying with the pages of her Irish phrasebook. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Yes, yes, the ladies are coming round to us. I can see it 
			every day. The ladies are with us. The best helpers the language 
			has. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—And the church, Father Moran? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—The church too. Coming round too. The work is going 
			ahead there too. Don't fret about the church. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Bah! he had done well to leave the room in disdain. He had 
			done well not to salute her on the steps of the library. He had 
			done well to leave her to flirt with her priest, to toy with a 
			church which was the scullerymaid of christendom. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Rude brutal anger routed the last lingering instant of ecstasy 
			from his soul. It broke up violently her fair image and 
			flung the fragments on all sides. On all sides distorted 
			reflections of her image started from his memory: the flower-girl 
			in the ragged dress with damp coarse hair and a hoyden's 
			face who had called herself his own girl and begged his handsel, 
			the kitchengirl in the next house who sang over the clatter 
			of her plates with the drawl of a country singer the first bars of 
			<span class="emph">By Killarney's Lakes and Fells</span>, a girl who had laughed gaily to 
			see him stumble when the iron grating in the footpath near 
			<span class="hide">53.343835 -6.267562</span>Cork Hill had caught the broken sole of his shoe, a girl he had 
			glanced at, attracted by her small ripe mouth, as she passed 
			out of Jacob's biscuit factory, who had cried to him over her 
			shoulder: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Do you like what you seen of me, straight hair and curly 
			eyebrows? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">And yet he felt that, however he might revile and mock her 
			image, his anger was also a form of homage. He had left the 
			classroom in disdain that was not wholly sincere, feeling that 
			perhaps the secret of her race lay behind those dark eyes upon 
			which her long lashes flung a quick shadow. He had told 
			himself bitterly as he walked through the streets that she was a 
			figure of the womanhood of her country, a batlike soul waking 
			to the consciousness of itself in darkness and secrecy and 
			loneliness, tarrying awhile, loveless and sinless, with her mild 
			lover and leaving him to whisper of innocent transgressions in 
			the latticed ear of a priest. His anger against her found vent in 
			coarse railing at her paramour, whose name and voice and 
			features offended his baffled pride: a priested peasant, with a 
			brother a policeman in Dublin and a brother a potboy in 
			<span class="hide">53.338748 -9.181478</span>Moycullen. To him she would unveil her soul's shy nakedness, 
			to one who was but schooled in the discharging of a formal 
			rite rather than to him, a priest of eternal imagination, transmuting 
			the daily bread of experience into the radiant body of 
			everliving life. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">The radiant image of the eucharist united again in an instant 
			his bitter and despairing thoughts, their cries arising 
			unbroken in a hymn of thanksgiving. </p>
		<p class="lg">
			Our broken cries and mournful lays <br>
			Rise in one eucharistic hymn. <br>
			Are you not weary of ardent ways? <br>
			While sacrificing hands upraise <br>
			The chalice flowing to the brim, <br>
			Tell no more of enchanted days. <br>
		</p>
		<p class="textParagraph">He spoke the verses aloud from the first lines till the music 
			and rhythm suffused his mind, turning it to quiet indulgence; 
			then copied them painfully to feel them the better by seeing 
			them; then lay back on his bolster. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">The full morning light had come. No sound was to be 
			heard: but he knew that all around him life was about to 
			awaken in common noises, hoarse voices, sleepy prayers. 
			Shrinking from that life he turned towards the wall, making a 
			cowl of the blanket and staring at the great overblown scarlet 
			flowers of the tattered wallpaper. He tried to warm his perishing 
			joy in their scarlet glow, imagining a roseway from where 
			he lay upwards to heaven all strewn  with scarlet flowers. 
			Weary! Weary! He too was weary of ardent ways. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">A gradual warmth, a languorous weariness passed over 
			him, descending along his spine from his closely cowled  head. 
			He felt it descend and, seeing himself as he lay, smiled. Soon 
			he would sleep. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">He had written verses for her again after ten years. Ten 
			years before she had worn her shawl cowlwise about her head, 
			sending sprays of her warm breath into the night air, tapping 
			her foot upon the glassy road. It was the last tram; the lank 
			brown horses knew it and shook their bells to the clear night 
			in admonition. The conductor talked with the driver, both 
			nodding often in the green light of the lamp. They stood on 
			the steps of the tram, he on the upper, she on the lower. She 
			came up to his step many times between their phrases and 
			went down again and once or twice remained beside him 
			forgetting to go down and then went down. Let be! Let be! </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Ten years from that wisdom of children to his folly. If he 
			sent her the verses? They would be read out at breakfast amid 
			the tapping of eggshells. Folly indeed! The brothers would 
			laugh and try to wrest the page from each other with their 
			strong hard fingers. The suave priest, her uncle, seated in 
			his armchair, would hold the page at arm's length, read it 
			smiling and approve of the literary form. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">No, no: that was folly. Even if he sent her the verses she 
			would not show them to others. No, no: she could not. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">He began to feel that he had wronged her. A sense of her 
			innocence moved him almost to pity her, an innocence he had 
			never understood till he had come to the knowledge of it 
			through sin, an innocence which she too had not understood 
			while she was innocent or before the strange humiliation of 
			her nature had first come upon her. Then first her soul had 
			begun to live as his soul had when he had first sinned: and a 
			tender compassion filled his heart as he remembered her frail 
			pallor and her eyes, humbled and saddened by the dark shame 
			of womanhood. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">While his soul had passed from ecstasy to languor where 
			had she been? Might it be, in the mysterious ways of spiritual 
			life, that her soul at those same moments had been conscious 
			of his homage? It might be. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">A glow of desire kindled again his soul and fired and 
			fulfilled all his body. Conscious of his desire she was waking 
			from odorous sleep, the temptress of his villanelle. Her eyes, 
			dark and with a look of languor, were opening to his eyes. Her 
			nakedness yielded to him, radiant, warm, odorous and lavishlimbed, 
			enfolded him like a shining cloud, enfolded him like 
			water with a liquid life: and like a cloud of vapour or like 
			waters circumfluent in space the liquid letters of speech, 
			symbols of the element of mystery, flowed forth over his 
			brain. </p>
		<p class="lg">
			Are you not weary of ardent ways, <br>
			Lure of the fallen seraphim? <br>
			Tell no more of enchanted days. <br>
			Your eyes have set man's heart ablaze <br>
			And you have had your will of him. <br>
			Are you not weary of ardent ways? <br>
			Above the flame the smoke of praise <br>
			Goes up from ocean rim to rim. <br>
			Tell no more of enchanted days. <br>
			Our broken cries and mournful lays <br>
			Rise in one eucharistic hymn. <br>
			Are you not weary of ardent ways? <br>
			While sacrificing hands upraise <br>
			The chalice flowing to the brim, <br>
			Tell no more of enchanted days. <br>
			And still you hold our longing gaze <br>
			With languorous look and lavish limb! <br>
			Are you not weary of ardent ways? <br>
			Tell no more of enchanted days. <br>

		<p class="textParagraph">What birds were they? He stood on the steps of the library 
			to look at them, leaning wearily on his ashplant. They flew 
			round and round the jutting shoulder of a house in <span class="hide">53.340809 -6.257636</span>Molesworth
			Street. The air of the late March evening made clear 
			their flight, their dark darting quivering bodies flying clearly 
			against the sky as against a limphung cloth of smoky tenuous 
			blue. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">He watched their flight; bird after bird: a dark flash, a 
			swerve, a flash again, a dart aside, a curve, a flutter of wings. 
			He tried to count them before all their darting quivering 
			bodies passed: six, ten, eleven: and wondered were they odd 
			or even in number. Twelve, thirteen: for two came wheeling 
			down from the upper sky. They were flying high and low but 
			ever round and round in straight and curving lines and ever 
			flying from left to right, circling about a temple of air. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">He  listened to the cries: like the squeak of mice behind the 
			wainscot: a shrill twofold note. But the notes were long and 
			shrill and whirring, unlike the cry of vermin, falling a third or 
			a fourth and trilled as the flying beaks clove the air. Their cry 
			was shrill and clear and fine and falling like threads of silken 
			light unwound from whirring spools. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">The inhuman clamour soothed his ears in which his 
			mother's sobs and reproaches murmured insistently and the 
			dark frail quivering bodies wheeling and fluttering and swerving 
			round an airy temple of the tenuous sky soothed his eyes 
			which still saw the image of his mother's face. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Why was he gazing upwards from the steps of the porch, 
			hearing their shrill twofold cry, watching their flight? For an 
			augury of good or evil? A phrase of Cornelius Agrippa flew 
			through his mind and then there flew hither and thither shapeless 
			thoughts from Swedenborg on the correspondence of 
			birds to things of the intellect and of how the creatures of the 
			air have their knowledge and know their times and seasons 
			because they, unlike man, are in the order of their life and 
			have not perverted that order by reason. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">And for ages men had gazed upward as he was gazing at 
			birds in flight. The colonnade above him made him think 
			vaguely of an ancient temple and the ashplant on which he 
			leaned wearily of the curved stick of an augur. A sense of fear 
			of the unknown moved in the heart of his weariness, a fear of 
			symbols and portents, of the hawklike man whose name he 
			bore soaring out of his captivity on osierwoven wings, of 
			Thoth, the god of writers, writing with a reed upon a tablet 
			and bearing on his narrow ibis head the cusped moon. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">He smiled as he thought of the god's image for it made him 
			think of a bottlenosed judge in a wig, putting commas into a 
			document which he held at arm's length and he knew that he 
			would not have remembered the god's name but that it was 
			like an Irish oath. It was folly. But was it for this folly that he 
			was about to leave for ever the house of prayer and prudence 
			into which he had been born and the order of life out of which 
			he had come? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">They came back with shrill cries over the jutting shoulder of 
			the house, flying darkly against the fading air. What birds were 
			they? He thought that they must be swallows who had come 
			back from the south. Then he was to go away for they were 
			birds ever going and coming, building ever an unlasting home 
			under the eaves of men's houses and ever leaving the homes 
			they had built to wander. </p>
		<p class="lg">
			Bend down your faces, Oona and Aleel, <br>
			I gaze upon them as the swallow gazes <br>
			Upon the nest under the eave before <br>
			He wander the loud waters. <br>
		</p>
		<p class="textParagraph">A soft liquid joy like the noise of many waters flowed over 
			his memory and he felt in his heart the soft peace of silent 
			spaces of fading tenuous sky above the waters, of oceanic 
			silence, of swallows flying through the seadusk over the flowing 
			waters. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">A soft liquid joy flowed through the words where the soft 
			long vowels hurtled noiselessly and fell away, lapping and 
			flowing back and ever shaking the white bells of their waves in 
			mute chime and mute peal and soft low swooning cry; and he 
			felt that the augury he had sought in the wheeling darting 
			birds and in the pale space of sky above him had come forth 
			from his heart like a bird from a turret quietly and swiftly. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Symbol of departure or of loneliness? The verses crooned in 
			the ear of his memory composed slowly before his remembering 
			eyes the scene of the hall on the night of the opening of the 
			national theatre. He was alone at the side of the balcony, 
			looking out of jaded eyes at the culture of Dublin in the stalls 
			and at the tawdry scenecloths and human dolls framed by the 
			garish lamps of the stage. A burly policeman sweated behind 
			him and seemed at every moment about to act. The catcalls 
			and hisses and mocking cries ran in rude gusts round the hall 
			from his scattered fellowstudents. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—A libel on Ireland! </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Made in Germany! </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Blasphemy! </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—We never sold our faith! </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—No  Irish woman ever did it! </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—We want no amateur atheists. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—We want no budding buddhists. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">A sudden swift hiss fell from the windows above him and he 
			knew that the electric lamps had been switched on in the 
			reader's room. He turned into the pillared  hall, now calmly lit, 
			went up the staircase and passed in through the clicking turnstile. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Cranly was sitting over near the dictionaries. A thick book, 
			opened at the frontispiece, lay before him on the wooden rest. 
			He leaned back in his chair, inclining his ear like that of a 
			confessor to the face of the medical student who was reading 
			to him a problem from the chess page of a journal. Stephen sat 
			down at his right and the priest at the other side of the  table 
			closed his copy of <span class="emph">The Tablet</span> with an angry snap and stood 
			up. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Cranly gazed after him blandly and vaguely. The medical 
			student went on in a softer voice: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Pawn to king's fourth. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—We had better go, Dixon, said Stephen in warning. He 
			has gone to complain. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Dixon folded the journal and rose with dignity, saying: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Our men retired in good order. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—With guns and cattle, added Stephen, pointing to the 
			titlepage of Cranly's book on which was printed <span class="emph">Diseases of 
			the Ox</span>. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">As they passed through a lane of the tables Stephen said: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Cranly, I want to speak to you. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Cranly did not answer or turn. He laid his book on the 
			counter and passed out, his wellshod feet sounding flatly on 
			the floor. On the staircase he paused and gazing absently at 
			Dixon repeated: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Pawn to king's bloody fourth. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Put it that way if you like, Dixon said. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">He had a quiet toneless voice and urbane manners and on a 
			finger of his plump clean hand he displayed at moments a 
			signet ring. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">As they crossed the hall a man of dwarfish stature came 
			towards them. Under the dome of his tiny hat his unshaven 
			face began to smile with pleasure and he was heard to murmur. 
			The eyes were melancholy as those of a monkey. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Good evening, captain, said Cranly, halting. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Good evening, gentlemen, said the stubblegrown monkeyish 
			face. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Warm weather for March, said Cranly. They have the 
			windows open upstairs. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Dixon smiled and turned his ring. The blackish monkeypuckered 
			face pursed its human mouth with gentle pleasure: 
			and its voice purred: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Delightful weather for March. Simply delightful. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—There are two nice young ladies upstairs, captain, tired of 
			waiting, Dixon said. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Cranly smiled and said kindly: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—The captain has only one love: sir Walter Scott. Isn't that 
			so, captain? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—What are you reading now, captain? Dixon asked. <span class="emph">The 
			Bride of <span class="hide">55.775902 -4.136255</span>Lammermoor?</span> </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—I love old Scott, the flexible lips said. I think he writes 
			something lovely. There is no writer can touch sir Walter 
			Scott. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">He moved a thin shrunken brown hand gently in the air in 
			time to his praise and his thin quick eyelids beat often over his 
			sad eyes. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Sadder to Stephen's ear was his speech: a genteel accent, 
			low and moist, marred by errors: and listening to it he wondered 
			was the story true and was the thin blood that flowed in 
			his shrunken frame noble and come of an incestuous  love? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">The park trees were heavy with rain and rain fell still and 
			ever in the lake, lying grey like a shield. A game of swans flew 
			there and the water and the shore beneath were fouled with 
			their greenwhite slime. They embraced softly, impelled by the 
			grey rainy light, the wet silent trees, the shieldlike witnessing 
			lake, the swans. They embraced without joy or passion, his 
			arm about his sister's neck. A grey woollen cloak was 
			wrapped athwart her from her shoulder to her waist: and her 
			fair head was bent in willing shame. He had loose redbrown 
			hair and tender shapely strong freckled hands. Face. There 
			was no face seen. The brother's face was bent upon her fair 
			rainfragrant hair. The hand freckled and strong and shapely 
			and caressing was Davin's hand. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">He frowned angrily upon his thought and on the shrivelled 
			mannikin who had called it forth. His father's gibes at the 
			<span class="hide">51.680080 -9.452576</span>Bantry gang leaped out of his memory. He held them at a 
			distance and brooded uneasily on his own thought again. Why 
			were they not  Cranly's hands? Had Davin's simplicity and 
			innocence stung him more secretly? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">He walked on across the hall with Dixon, leaving Cranly to 
			take leave elaborately of the dwarf. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Under the colonnade Temple was standing in the midst of a 
			little group of students. One of them cried: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Dixon, come over till you hear. Temple is in grand form. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Temple turned on him his dark gipsy eyes. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—You're a hypocrite, O'Keeffe, he said, and Dixon's a 
			smiler. By hell, I think that's a good literary expression. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">He laughed slily, looking in Stephen's face, repeating: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—By hell, I'm delighted with that name. A smiler. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">A stout student who stood below them on the steps said: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Come back to the mistress, Temple. We want to hear 
			about that. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—He had, faith, Temple said. And he was a married man 
			too. And all the priests used to be dining there. By hell, I think 
			they all had a touch. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—We shall call it riding a hack to spare the hunter, said 
			Dixon. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Tell us, Temple, O'Keeffe said, how many quarts of 
			porter have you in you? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—All your intellectual soul is in that phrase, O'Keeffe, said 
			Temple with open scorn. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">He moved with a shambling gait round the group and spoke 
			to Stephen. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Did you know that the Forsters are the kings of Belgium? 
			he asked. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Cranly came out through the door of the entrance hall, his 
			hat thrust back on the nape of his neck and picking his teeth 
			with care. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—And here's the wiseacre, said Temple. Do you know that 
			about the Forsters? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">He paused for an answer. Cranly dislodged a figseed from 
			his teeth on the point of his rude toothpick and gazed at it 
			intently. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—The Forster  family, Temple said, is descended from Baldwin 
			the First, king of Flanders. He was called the Forester. 
			Forester and Forster are the same name. A descendant of 
			Baldwin the First, captain Francis Forster, settled in Ireland 
			and married the daughter of the last chieftain of Clanbrassil. 
			Then there are the Blake Forsters. That's a different branch. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—From Baldhead, king of Flanders, Cranly repeated, 
			rooting again deliberately at his gleaming uncovered teeth. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Where did you pick up all that history? O'Keeffe asked. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—I know all the history of your family too, Temple said, 
			turning to Stephen. Do you know what Giraldus Cambrensis 
			says about your family? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Is he descended from Baldwin too? asked a tall consumptive 
			student with dark eyes. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Baldhead, Cranly repeated, sucking at a crevice in his 
			teeth. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Pernobilis et pervetusta familia, Temple said to Stephen. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">The stout student who stood below them on the steps farted 
			briefly. Dixon turned towards him saying in a soft voice: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Did an angel speak? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Cranly turned also and said vehemently but without anger: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Goggins, you're the flamingest dirty devil I ever met, do 
			you know. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—I had it on my mind to say that, Goggins answered 
			firmly. It did no one any harm, did it? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—We hope, Dixon said suavely, that it was not of the kind 
			known to science as a paulo post futurum. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Didn't I tell you he was a smiler? said Temple, turning 
			right and left. Didn't I give him that name? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—You did. We're not deaf, said the tall consumptive. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Cranly still frowned at the stout student below him. Then, 
			with a snort of disgust, he shoved him violently down the 
			steps. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Go away from here, he said rudely. Go away, you 
			stinkpot. And you are a stinkpot. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Goggins skipped down on to the gravel and at once returned 
			to his place with good humour. Temple turned back to 
			Stephen and asked: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Do you believe in the law of heredity? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Are you drunk or what are you or what are you trying to 
			say? asked Cranly, facing round on him with an expression of 
			wonder. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—The most profound sentence ever written, Temple said 
			with enthusiasm, is the sentence at the end of the zoology. 
			Reproduction is the beginning of death. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">He touched Stephen timidly at the elbow and said eagerly: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Do you feel how profound that is because you are a 
			poet? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Cranly pointed his long forefinger. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Look at him! he said with scorn to the others. Look at 
			Ireland's hope! </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">They laughed at his words and gesture. Temple turned on 
			him bravely, saying: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Cranly, you're always sneering at me. I can see that. But 
			I am as good as you any day. Do you know what I think about 
			you now as compared with myself? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—My dear man, said Cranly urbanely, you are incapable, 
			do you know, absolutely incapable of thinking. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—But do you know, Temple went on, what I think of you 
			and of myself compared together? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Out with it, Temple! the stout student cried from the 
			steps. Get it out in bits! </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Temple turned right and left, making sudden feeble gestures 
			as he spoke. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—I'm a ballocks, he said, shaking his head in despair. I am. 
			And I know I am. And I admit it that I am. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Dixon patted him lightly on the shoulder and said mildly: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—And it does you every credit, Temple. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—But he, Temple said, pointing to Cranly. He is a ballocks 
			too like me. Only he doesn't know it. And that's the only 
			difference I see. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">A burst of laughter covered his words. But he turned again 
			to Stephen and said with a sudden eagerness: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—That word is a most interesting word. That's the only 
			English dual number. Did you know? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Is it? Stephen said vaguely. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">He was watching Cranly's firmfeatured suffering face, lit up 
			now by a smile of false patience. The gross name had passed 
			over it like foul water poured over an old stone image, patient 
			of injuries: and, as he watched him, he saw him raise his hat in 
			salute and uncover the black hair that stood up stiffly from his 
			forehead like an iron crown. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">She passed out from the porch of the library and bowed 
			across Stephen in reply to Cranly's greeting. He also? Was 
			there not a slight flush on Cranly's cheek? Or had it come 
			forth at Temple's words? The light had waned. He could not 
			see. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Did that explain his friend's listless silence, his harsh comments, 
			the sudden intrusions of rude speech with which he had 
			shattered so often Stephen's ardent wayward confessions? 
			Stephen had forgiven freely for he had found this rudeness 
			also in himself towards himself. And he remembered an 
			evening when he had dismounted from a borrowed creaking 
			bicycle to pray to God in a wood near <span class="hide">53.450924 -6.150138</span>Malahide. He had lifted 
			up his arms and spoken in ecstasy to the sombre nave of the 
			trees, knowing that he stood on holy ground and in a holy 
			hour. And when  two constabularymen had come into sight 
			round a bend in the gloomy road he had broken off his prayer 
			to whistle loudly an air from the last pantomime. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">He began to beat the frayed end of his ashplant against the 
			base of a pillar. Had Cranly not heard him? Yet he could wait. 
			The talk about him ceased for a moment: and a soft hiss fell 
			again from a window above. But no other sound was in the air 
			and the swallows whose flight he had followed with idle eyes 
			were sleeping. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">She had passed through the dusk. And therefore the air was 
			silent save for one soft hiss that fell. And therefore the tongues 
			about him had ceased their babble. Darkness  was falling. </p>
		<span class="emph">Darkness falls from the air.</span> <br>
		<p class="textParagraph">A trembling joy, lambent as a faint light, played like a fairy 
			host around him. But why? Her passage through the darkening 
			air or the verse with its black vowels and its opening 
			sound, rich and lutelike? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">He walked away slowly towards the deeper shadows at the 
			end of the colonnade, beating the stone softly with his stick to 
			hide his revery from the students whom he had left: and 
			allowed his mind to summon back to itself the age of Dowland 
			and Byrd and Nash. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Eyes, opening from the darkness of desire, eyes that 
			dimmed the breaking east. What was their languid grace but 
			the softness of chambering? And what was their shimmer but 
			the shimmer of the scum that mantled the cesspool of the 
			court of a slobbering Stuart. And he tasted in the language of 
			memory ambered wines, dying fallings of sweet airs, the proud 
			pavan: and saw with the eyes of memory kind gentlewomen in 
			<span class="hide">51.511732 -0.123270</span>Covent Garden wooing from their balconies with sucking 
			mouths and the poxfouled wenches of the taverns and young 
			wives that, gaily yielding to their ravishers, clipped and 
			clipped again. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">The images he had summoned gave him no pleasure. They 
			were secret and enflaming but her image was not entangled by 
			them. That was not the way to think of her. It was not even 
			the way in which he thought of her. Could his mind then not 
			trust itself? Old phrases, sweet only with a disinterred sweetness 
			like the figseeds Cranly rooted out of his gleaming teeth. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">It was not thought nor vision though he knew vaguely that 
			her figure was passing homeward through the city. Vaguely 
			first and then more sharply he smelt her body. A conscious 
			unrest seethed in his blood. Yes, it was her body he smelt: a 
			wild and languid smell: the tepid limbs over which his music 
			had flowed desirously and the secret soft linen upon which her 
			flesh distilled odour and a dew. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">A louse crawled over the nape of his neck and, putting his 
			thumb and forefinger deftly beneath his loose collar, he caught 
			it. He rolled its body, tender yet brittle as a grain of rice, 
			between thumb and finger for an instant before he let it fall 
			from him and wondered would it live or die. There came to his 
			mind a curious phrase from Cornelius a Lapide which said 
			that the lice born of human sweat were not created by God 
			with the other animals on the sixth day. But the tickling of the 
			skin of his neck made his mind raw and red. The life of his 
			body, illclad, illfed, louseeaten, made him close his eyelids in a 
			sudden spasm of despair: and in the darkness he saw the 
			brittle bright bodies of lice falling from the air and turning 
			often as they fell. Yes; and it was not darkness that fell from 
			the air. It was brightness. </p>
		<span class="emph">Brightness falls from the air.</span> <br>
		<p class="textParagraph">He had not even remembered rightly Nash's line. All the 
			images it  had awakened were false. His mind bred vermin. His 
			thoughts were lice born of the sweat of sloth. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">He came back quickly along the colonnade towards the 
			group of students. Well then, let her go and be damned to her. 
			She could love some clean athlete who washed himself every 
			morning to the waist and had black hair on his chest. Let her. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Cranly had taken another dried fig from the supply in his 
			pocket and was eating it slowly and noisily. Temple sat on the 
			pediment of a pillar, leaning back, his cap pulled down on his 
			sleepy eyes. A squat young man came out of the porch, a 
			leather portfolio tucked under his armpit. He marched towards 
			the group, striking the flags with the heels of his boots 
			and with the ferule of his heavy umbrella. Then, raising the 
			umbrella in salute, he said to all: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Good evening, sirs. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">He struck the flags again and tittered while his head trembled 
			with a slight nervous movement. The tall consumptive 
			student and Dixon and O'Keeffe were speaking in Irish and 
			did not answer him. Then, turning to Cranly, he said: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Good evening, particularly to you. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">He moved the umbrella in indication and tittered again. 
			Cranly, who was still chewing the fig, answered with loud 
			movements of his jaws. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Good? Yes. It is a good evening. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">The squat student looked at him seriously and shook his 
			umbrella gently and reprovingly. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—I can see, he said, that you are about to make obvious 
			remarks. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Um, Cranly answered, holding out what remained of the 
			halfchewed fig and jerking it towards the squat student's 
			mouth in sign that he should eat. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">The squat student did not eat it but, indulging his  special 
			humour, said gravely, still tittering and prodding his phrase 
			with his  umbrella: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Do you intend that ... </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">He broke off, pointed bluntly to the munched pulp of the fig 
			and said loudly: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—I allude to that. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Um, Cranly said as before. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Do you intend that now, the squat student said, as &gt; 
			<span class="emph">facto</span> or, let us say, as so to speak? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Dixon turned aside from his group, saying: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Goggins was waiting for you, Glynn. He has gone round 
			to the Adelphi to look for you and Moynihan. What have you 
			there? he asked, tapping the portfolio under Glynn's arm. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Examination papers, Glynn answered. I give them 
			monthly examinations to see that they are profiting by my 
			tuition. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">He also tapped the portfolio and coughed gently and smiled. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Tuition!  said Cranly rudely. I suppose you mean the 
			barefooted children that are taught by a bloody ape like you. 
			God help them! </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">He bit off the rest of the fig and flung away the butt. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—I suffer little children to come unto me, Glynn said 
			amiably. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—A bloody ape, Cranly repeated with emphasis, and a 
			blasphemous bloody ape! </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Temple stood up and, pushing past Cranly, addressed 
			Glynn: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—That phrase you said now, he said, is from the new 
			testament about suffer the children to come to me. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Go to sleep again, Temple, said O'Keeffe. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Very well, then, Temple continued, still addressing 
			Glynn, and if Jesus suffered the children to come why does the 
			church send them all to hell if they die unbaptised? Why is 
			that? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Were you baptised yourself, Temple? the consumptive 
			student asked. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—But why are they sent to hell if Jesus said they were all to 
			come? Temple said, his eyes searching in Glynn's eyes. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Glynn coughed and said gently, holding back with difficulty 
			the nervous titter in his voice and moving his umbrella at every 
			word: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—And, as you remark, if it is thus I ask emphatically 
			whence comes this thusness. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Because the church is cruel like all old sinners, Temple 
			said. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Are you quite orthodox on that point, Temple? Dixon 
			said suavely. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Saint Augustine says that about unbaptised children 
			going to hell, Temple answered, because he was a cruel old 
			sinner too. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—I bow to you, Dixon said, but I had the impression that 
			limbo existed for such cases. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Don't argue with him, Dixon, Cranly said brutally. Don't 
			talk to him or look at him. Lead him home with a sugan the 
			way you'd lead a bleating goat. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Limbo! Temple cried. That's a fine invention too. Like 
			hell. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—But with the unpleasantness left out, Dixon said. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">He turned smiling to the others and said: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—I think I am voicing the opinions of all present in saying 
			so much. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—You are, Glynn said in a firm tone. On that point Ireland 
			is united. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">He struck the ferule of his umbrella on the stone floor of the 
			colonnade. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Hell, Temple said. I can respect that invention of the 
			grey spouse of Satan. Hell is Roman, like the walls of the 
			Romans, strong and ugly. But what is limbo? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Put him back into  the perambulator, Cranly, O'Keeffe 
			called out. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Cranly made a swift step towards Temple, halted, stamping 
			his foot, crying as if to a fowl: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Hoosh! </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Temple moved away nimbly. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Do you know what limbo is? he cried. Do you know what 
			we call a notion like that in Roscommon? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Hoosh! Blast you! Cranly cried, clapping his hands. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Neither my arse nor my elbow! Temple cried out scornfully. 
			And that's what I call limbo. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Give us that stick here, Cranly said. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">He snatched the ashplant roughly from Stephen's hand and 
			sprang down the steps: but Temple, hearing him move in 
			pursuit, fled through the dusk like a wild creature, nimble and 
			fleetfooted. Cranly's heavy boots were heard loudly charging 
			across the quadrangle and then returning heavily, foiled and 
			spurning the gravel at each step. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">His step was angry and with an angry abrupt gesture he 
			thrust the stick back into Stephen's hand. Stephen felt that his 
			anger had another cause but, feigning patience, touched his 
			arm slightly and said quietly: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Cranly, I told you I wanted to speak to you. Come away. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Cranly looked at him for a few moments and asked: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Now? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Yes, now, Stephen said. We can't speak here. Come 
			away. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">They crossed the quadrangle together without speaking. 
			The birdcall from &gt; whistled softly followed them from 
			the steps of the porch. Cranly turned: and Dixon, who had 
			whistled, called out: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Where are you fellows off to? What about that  game, 
			Cranly? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">They parleyed in shouts across the still air about a game of 
			billiards to be played in the <span class="hide">53.350570 -6.254002</span>Adelphi hotel. Stephen walked on 
			alone and out into the quiet of Kildare Street. Opposite Maple's 
			hotel he stood to wait, patient again. The name of the 
			hotel, a colourless polished wood, and its colourless quiet 
			front stung him like a glance of polite disdain. He stared 
			angrily back at the softly lit drawingroom of the hotel in which 
			he imagined the sleek lives of the patricians of Ireland housed 
			in calm. They thought of army commissions and land agents: 
			peasants greeted them along the roads  in the country: they 
			knew the names of certain French dishes and gave orders to 
			jarvies in highpitched provincial voices which pierced through 
			their skintight accents. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">How could he hit their conscience or how cast his shadow 
			over the imaginations of their daughters, before their squires 
			begat upon them, that they might breed a race less ignoble 
			than their own? And under the deepened dusk he felt the 
			thoughts and desires of the race to which he belonged flitting 
			like bats, across the dark country lanes,  under trees by the 
			edges of streams and near the poolmottled bogs. A woman had 
			waited in the doorway as Davin had passed by at night and, 
			offering him a cup of milk, had all but wooed him to her bed; 
			for Davin had the mild eyes of one who could be secret. But 
			him no woman's eyes had wooed. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">His arm was taken in a strong grip and Cranly's voice said: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Let us eke go. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">They walked southward in silence. Then Cranly said: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—That blithering idiot Temple! I swear to Moses, do you 
			know, that I'll be the death of that fellow one time. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">But his voice was no longer angry and Stephen wondered 
			was he thinking of her greeting to him under the porch. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">They turned to the left and walked on as before. When they 
			had gone on so for some time Stephen said: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Cranly, I had an unpleasant quarrel this evening. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—With your people? Cranly asked. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—With my mother. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—About religion? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Yes, Stephen answered. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">After a pause Cranly asked: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—What age is your mother? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Not old, Stephen said. She wishes me to make my easter 
			duty. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—And will you? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—I will not, Stephen said. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Why not? Cranly said. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—I will not serve, answered Stephen. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—That remark was made before, Cranly said calmly. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—It is made behind now, said Stephen hotly. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Cranly pressed Stephen's arm, saying: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Go easy, my dear man. You're an excitable bloody man, 
			do you know. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">He laughed nervously as he spoke and, looking up into 
			Stephen's face with moved and friendly eyes, said: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Do you know that you are an excitable man? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—I daresay I am, said Stephen, laughing also. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Their minds, lately estranged, seemed suddenly to have 
			been drawn closer, one to the other. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Do you believe in the eucharist? Cranly asked. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—I do not, Stephen said. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Do you disbelieve then? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—I neither believe in it nor disbelieve in it, Stephen answered. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Many persons have doubts, even religious persons, yet 
			they overcome them or put them aside, Cranly said. Are your 
			doubts on that point too strong? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—I do not wish to overcome them, Stephen answered. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Cranly, embarrassed for a moment, took another fig from 
			his pocket and was about to eat it when Stephen said: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Don't, please. You cannot discuss this question with your 
			mouth full of chewed  fig. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Cranly examined the fig by the light of a lamp under which 
			he halted. Then he smelt it with both nostrils, bit a tiny piece, 
			spat it out and threw the fig rudely into the gutter. Addressing 
			it as it lay, he said: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire! </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Taking Stephen's arm, he went on again and said: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Do you not fear that those words may be spoken to you 
			on the day of judgment? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—What is offered me on the other hand? Stephen asked. 
			An eternity of bliss in the company of the dean of studies? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Remember, Cranly said, that he would be glorified. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Ay, Stephen said somewhat bitterly, bright, agile, impassible 
			and, above all, subtle. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—It is a curious thing, do you know, Cranly said dispassionately, 
			how your mind is supersaturated with the religion in 
			which you say you disbelieve. Did you believe in it when you 
			were at school? I bet you did. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—I did, Stephen answered. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—And were you happier then? Cranly asked softly. Happier 
			than you are now, for instance? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Often happy, Stephen said, and often unhappy. I was 
			someone else then. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—How someone else? What do you mean by that  statement? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—I mean, said Stephen, that I was not myself as I am now, 
			as I had to become. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Not as you are now, not as you had to become, Cranly 
			repeated. Let me ask you a question. Do you love your 
			mother? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Stephen shook his head slowly. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—I don't know what your words mean, he said simply. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Have you never loved anyone? Cranly asked. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Do you mean women? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—I am not speaking of that, Cranly said in a colder tone. I 
			ask you if you ever felt love towards anyone or anything. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Stephen walked on beside his friend, staring gloomily at the 
			footpath. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—I tried to love God, he said at length. It seems now I 
			failed. It is very difficult. I tried to unite my will with the will 
			of God instant by instant. In that I did not always fail. I could 
			perhaps do that still ... </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Cranly cut him short by asking: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Has your mother had a happy life? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—How do I know? Stephen said. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—How many children had she? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Nine or ten, Stephen answered. Some died. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Was your father .... Cranly interrupted himself for an 
			instant: and then said: I don't want to pry  into your family 
			affairs. But was your father what is called  well-to-do? I mean 
			when you were growing up? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Yes, Stephen said. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—What was he? Cranly asked after a pause. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Stephen began to enumerate glibly his father's attributes. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—A medical student, an oarsman, a tenor, an amateur 
			actor, a shouting politician, a small landlord, a small investor, 
			a drinker, a good fellow, a storyteller, somebody's secretary, 
			something in a distillery, a taxgatherer, a bankrupt and at 
			present a praiser of his own past. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Cranly laughed, tightening  his grip on Stephen's arm, and 
			said: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—The distillery is damn good. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Is there anything else you want to know? Stephen asked. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Are you in good circumstances at present? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Do I look it? Stephen asked bluntly. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—So then, Cranly went on musingly, you were born in the 
			lap of luxury. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">He used the phrase broadly and loudly as he often used 
			technical expressions as if he wished his hearer to understand 
			that they were used by him without conviction. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Your mother must have gone through a good deal of 
			suffering, he said then. Would you not try to save her from 
			suffering more even if ... or would you? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—If I could, Stephen said. That would cost me very little. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Then do so, Cranly said. Do as she wishes you to do. 
			What is it for you? You disbelieve in it. It is a form: nothing 
			else. And you will set her mind at rest. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">He ceased and, as Stephen did not reply, remained silent. 
			Then, as if giving utterance to the process of his own thought, 
			he said: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Whatever else is unsure in this stinking dunghill of a 
			world a mother's love is not. Your mother brings you into the 
			world, carries you first in her body. What do we know about 
			what she feels? But whatever she feels, it, at least, must be 
			real. It must be. What are our ideas or ambitions? Play. Ideas! 
			Why, that bloody bleating goat Temple has ideas. MacCann 
			has ideas too. Every jackass going the  roads thinks he has 
			ideas. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Stephen, who had been listening to the unspoken speech 
			behind the words, said with  assumed carelessness: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Pascal, if I remember rightly, would not suffer his mother 
			to kiss him as he feared the contact of her sex. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Pascal was a pig, said Cranly. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Aloysius Gonzaga, I think, was of the same mind, Stephen 
			said. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—And he was another pig then, said Cranly. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—The church calls him a saint, Stephen objected. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—I don't care a flaming damn what anyone calls him, 
			Cranly said rudely and flatly. I call him a pig. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Stephen, preparing the words neatly in his mind, continued: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Jesus, too, seems to have treated his mother with scant 
			courtesy in public but Suarez, a jesuit theologian and Spanish 
			gentleman, has apologised for him. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Did the idea ever occur to you, Cranly asked, that Jesus 
			was not what he pretended to be? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—The first person to whom that idea occurred,  Stephen 
			answered, was Jesus himself. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—I mean, Cranly said,  hardening in his speech, did the 
			idea ever occur to you that he was himself a conscious hypocrite, 
			what he called the jews of his time, a whited sepulchre? 
			Or, to put it more plainly, that he was a blackguard? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—That idea never occurred  to me, Stephen answered. But I 
			am curious to know are you trying to make a convert of me or 
			a pervert of yourself? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">He turned towards his friend's face and saw there a raw 
			smile which some force of will strove to make finely 
			significant. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Cranly asked suddenly in a plain sensible tone: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Tell me the truth. Were you at all shocked by what I 
			said? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Somewhat, Stephen said. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—And why were you shocked, Cranly pressed on in the 
			same tone, if you feel sure that our religion is false and that 
			Jesus was not the son of God? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—I am not at all sure of it, Stephen said. He is more like a 
			son of God than a son of Mary. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—And is that why you will not communicate, Cranly asked, 
			because you are not sure of that too, because you feel that the 
			host too may be the body and blood of the son of God and 
			not a wafer of bread? And because you fear that it may be? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Yes, Stephen said quietly. I feel that and I also fear it. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—I see, Cranly said. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Stephen, struck by his tone of closure, reopened the discussion 
			at once by saying: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—I fear many things: dogs, horses, firearms, the sea, 
			thunderstorms, machinery, the country roads at night. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—But why do you fear a bit of bread? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—I imagine, Stephen said, that there is a malevolent  reality 
			behind those things I say I fear. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Do you fear then, Cranly asked, that the God of the 
			Roman catholics would strike you dead and damn you if you 
			made a sacrilegious communion? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—The God of the Roman catholics could do that now, 
			Stephen said. I fear more than that the chemical action which 
			would be set up in my soul by a false homage to a symbol 
			behind which are massed twenty centuries of authority and 
			veneration. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Would you, Cranly asked, in extreme danger commit 
			that particular sacrilege? For instance, if you lived in the penal 
			days? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—I cannot answer for the past, Stephen replied. Possibly 
			not. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Then, said Cranly, you do not intend to become a protestant? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—I said that I had lost the faith, Stephen answered, but not 
			that I had lost selfrespect. What kind of liberation would that 
			be to forsake an absurdity which is logical and coherent and to 
			embrace one which is illogical and incoherent? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">They had walked on towards the township of <span class="hide">51.873620 -8.347738</span>Pembroke
			and now, as they went on slowly along the avenues, the trees 
			and the scattered lights in the villas soothed their minds. The 
			air of wealth and repose diffused about them seemed to comfort 
			their neediness. Behind a hedge of laurel a light glimmered 
			in the window of a kitchen and the voice of a servant 
			was heard singing as she sharpened knives. She sang, in short 
			broken bars, &gt;. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Cranly stopped to listen, saying: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Mulier cantat. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">The soft beauty of the Latin word touched with an enchanting 
			touch the  dark of the evening, with a touch fainter and 
			more persuading than the touch of music or of a woman's 
			hand. The strife of their minds was quelled. The figure of 
			woman as she appears in the liturgy of the church passed 
			silently through the darkness: a whiterobed figure, small and 
			slender as a boy and with a falling girdle. Her voice, frail and 
			high as a boy's, was heard intoning from a distant choir the 
			first words of a woman which pierce the gloom and clamour of 
			the first chanting of the passion: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Et tu cum Jesu Galileao eras. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">And all  hearts were touched and turned to her voice, shining 
			like a young star, shining clearer as the voice intoned the 
			proparoxyton and more faintly as the cadence died. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">The singing ceased. They went on together, Cranly repeating 
			in strongly stressed rhythm the end of the refrain: </p>
		<p class="lg">
			And when we are married, <br>
			O, how happy we'll be <br>
			For I love sweet Rosie O'Grady <br>
			And Rosie O'Grady loves me. <br>
		</p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—There's  real poetry for you, he said. There's real love. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">He glanced sideways at Stephen with a strange smile and 
			said: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Do you consider that poetry? Or do you know what the 
			words mean? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—I want to see Rosie first, said Stephen. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—She's easy to find, Cranly said. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">His hat had come down on his forehead. He shoved it back: 
			and in the shadow of the trees Stephen saw his pale face, 
			framed by the dark, and his large dark eyes. Yes. His face was 
			handsome: and his body was strong and hard. He had spoken 
			of a mother's love. He felt then the sufferings of women, the 
			weaknesses of their bodies and souls: and would shield them 
			with a strong  and resolute arm and bow his mind to them. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Away then: it is time to go. A voice spoke softly to Stephen's 
			lonely heart, bidding him go and telling him that his 
			friendship was coming to an end. Yes; he would go. He could 
			not strive against another. He knew his part. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Probably I shall go away, he said. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Where? Cranly asked. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Where I can, Stephen said. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Yes, Cranly said. It might be difficult for you to live here 
			now. But is it that that makes you go? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—I have to go, Stephen answered. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Because, Cranly continued, you need not look upon 
			yourself as driven away if you do not wish to go or as a heretic 
			or an outlaw. There are many good believers who think as you 
			do. Would that surprise you? The church is not the stone 
			building nor even the clergy and their dogmas. It is the whole 
			mass of those born into it. I don't know what you wish to do 
			in life. Is it what you told me the night we were standing 
			outside <span class="hide">53.333446 -6.262433</span>Harcourt Street Station? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Yes, Stephen said, smiling in spite of himself at Cranly's 
			way of remembering thoughts in connection with places. The 
			night you spent half an hour wrangling with Doherty about the 
			shortest way from <span class="hide">53.136900 -6.310000</span>Sallygap to Larras. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Pothead! Cranly said with calm contempt. What does he 
			know about the way from Sallygap to Larras? Or what does 
			he know about anything for that matter? And the big slobbering 
			washingpot head of him! </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">He broke out into a loud long laugh. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Well? Stephen said. Do you remember the rest? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—What you said, is it? Cranly asked. Yes, I remember it. 
			To discover the mode of life or of art whereby your spirit 
			could express itself in unfettered freedom. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Stephen raised his hat in acknowledgment. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Freedom! Cranly repeated. But you are not free enough 
			yet to commit a sacrilege. Tell me, would you rob? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—I would beg first, Stephen said. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—And if you got  nothing, would you rob? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—You wish me to say, Stephen answered, that the rights of 
			property are provisional and that in certain circumstances it is 
			not unlawful to rob. Everyone would act in that belief. So I 
			will not make you that answer. Apply to the jesuit theologian 
			Juan Mariana de Talavera who will also explain to you in 
			what circumstances you may lawfully kill your king and 
			whether you had better hand him his poison in a goblet or 
			smear it for him upon his robe or his saddlebow. Ask me 
			rather would I suffer others to rob me or, if they did, would I 
			call down upon them what I believe is called the chastisement 
			of the secular arm? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—And would you? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—I think, Stephen said, it would pain me as much to do so 
			as to be robbed. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—I see, Cranly said. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">He produced his match and began to clean the crevice 
			between two teeth. Then he said carelessly: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Tell me, for example, would you deflower a virgin? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Excuse me, Stephen said politely, is that not the ambition 
			of most young gentlemen? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—What then is your point of view? Cranly asked. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">His last phrase, soursmelling as the smoke of charcoal and 
			disheartening, excited Stephen's brain, over which its fumes 
			seemed to brood. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Look here, Cranly, he said. You have asked me what I 
			would do and what I would not do. I will tell you what I will do 
			and what I will not do. I will not serve that in which I no 
			longer believe whether it call itself my home, my fatherland or 
			my church: and I will try to express myself in some mode of 
			life or art as freely as I can and as wholly as I can, using for 
			my defence the only arms I allow myself to use - silence, exile, 
			and cunning. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Cranly seized his arm and steered him round so as to head 
			back towards <span class="hide">53.328562 -6.251897</span>Leeson Park. He laughed almost slily and pressed 
			Stephen's arm with an elder's affection. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Cunning indeed! he said. Is it you? You poor poet, you! </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—And you made me confess to you, Stephen said, thrilled 
			by his touch, as I have confessed to you so  many other things, 
			have I not? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Yes, my child, Cranly said, still gaily. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—You made me confess the fears that I have. But I will tell 
			you also what I do not fear. I do not fear to be alone or to be 
			spurned for another or to leave whatever I have to leave. And 
			I am not afraid to make a mistake, even  a great  mistake, a 
			lifelong mistake and perhaps as long as eternity too. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Cranly, now grave again, slowed his pace and said: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Alone, quite alone. You have no fear of that. And you 
			know what that word means? Not only to be separate from all 
			others but to have not even one friend. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—I will take the risk, said Stephen. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—And not to have any one person, Cranly said, who would 
			be more than a friend, more even than the noblest and truest 
			friend a man ever had. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">His words seemed to have struck some deep chord in his 
			own nature. Had he spoken of himself, of himself as he was or 
			wished  to be? Stephen watched his face for some moments in 
			silence. A cold sadness was there. He had spoken of himself, 
			of his own loneliness which he feared. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Of whom are you speaking? Stephen asked at length. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Cranly did not answer. </p>

		

	  

	 

		<p class="textParagraph">20 &gt; Long talk with Cranly on the subject of my 
			revolt. He had his grand manner on. I supple and suave. 
			Attacked me on the score of love for one's mother. Tried to 
			imagine his mother: cannot. Told me once, in a moment of 
			thoughtlessness, his father was sixtyone when he was born. 
			Can see him. Strong farmer type. Pepper and salt suit. Square 
			feet. Unkempt grizzled beard. Probably attends coursing 
			matches. Pays his dues regularly but not plentifully to Father 
			Dwyer of Larras. Sometimes talks to girls after nightfall. But 
			his mother? Very young or very old? Hardly the first. If so, 
			Cranly would not have spoken as he did. Old then. Probably, 
			and neglected. Hence Cranly's despair of soul: the child of 
			exhausted loins. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">21 &gt; Thought this in bed last night but was 
			too lazy and free to add it. Free, yes. The exhausted loins are 
			those of Elisabeth and Zachary. Then he is the precursor. 
			Item: he eats chiefly belly bacon and dried figs. Read locusts 
			and wild honey. Also, when thinking of him, saw always a 
			stern severed head or deathmask as if outlined on a grey 
			curtain or veronica. Decollation they call it in the fold. Puzzled 
			for the moment by saint John at the Latin gate. What do I 
			see? A decollated precursor trying to pick the lock. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">21 &gt; Free. Soulfree and fancyfree. Let the 
			dead bury the dead. Ay. And let the dead marry the dead. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">22 &gt; In company with Lynch followed a sizable 
			hospital nurse. Lynch's idea. Dislike it. Two lean hungry 
			greyhounds walking after a heifer. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">23 &gt; Have not seen her since that night. Unwell? Sits 
			at the fire perhaps with mamma's shawl on her shoulders. But 
			not peevish. A nice bowl of gruel? Won't you now? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">24 &gt; Began with a discussion with my mother. Subject: 
			B. V. M. Handicapped by my sex and youth. To escape 
			held up relations between Jesus and Papa against those between 
			Mary and her son. Said religion was not a lying-in 
			hospital. Mother indulgent. Said I have a queer mind and have 
			read too much. Not true. Have read little and understood less. 
			Then she said I would come back to faith because I had a 
			restless mind. This means to leave church by backdoor of sin 
			and reenter through the skylight of repentance. Cannot repent. 
			Told her so and asked for sixpence. Got threepence. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Then went to college. Other wrangle with little roundhead 
			rogue'seye Ghezzi. This time about Bruno the Nolan. Began in 
			Italian and ended in pidgin English. He said Bruno was a 
			terrible heretic. I said he was terribly burned. He agreed to 
			this with some sorrow. Then gave me recipe for what he calls 
			<span class="emph">risotto alla bergamasca</span>. When he pronounces a soft <span class="emph">o</span> he 
			protrudes his full carnal lips as if he kissed the vowel. Has he? 
			And could he repent? Yes, he could: and cry two round 
			rogue's tears, one from each eye. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Crossing Stephen's, that is, <span class="hide">53.338174 -6.259119</span>my green, remembered that his 
			countrymen and not mine had invented what Cranly the other 
			night called our religion. A quartet of them, soldiers  of the 
			ninetyseventh infantry regiment, sat at the foot of the cross 
			and tossed up dice for the overcoat of the crucified. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Went to library. Tried to read three reviews. Useless. She is

		<p class="textParagraph">30 &gt; This evening Cranly was in the porch of the

			please copy.) He told us he met an old man there in a mountain 
			cabin. Old man had red eyes and short pipe. Old man 
			spoke Irish. Mulrennan spoke Irish. Then old man and Mulrennan 
			spoke English. Mulrennan spoke to him about universe 
			and stars. Old man sat, listened, smoked, spat. Then said: </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">—Ah, there must be terrible queer creatures at the latter 
			end of the world. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">I fear him. I fear his redrimmed horny eyes. It is with him I 
			must struggle all through this night till day come, till he or I lie 
			dead, gripping him by the sinewy throat till ... Till what? 
			Till he yield to me? No. I mean him no harm. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">15 &gt; Met her today pointblank in <span class="hide">53.342556 -6.259573</span>Grafton Street. The 
			crowd brought us together. We both stopped. She asked me 
			why I never came, said she had heard all sorts of stories about 
			me. This was only to gain time. Asked me, was I writing 
			poems? About whom? I asked her. This confused her more 
			and I felt sorry and mean. Turned off that valve at once 
			and opened the spiritual-heroic refrigerating apparatus, invented 
			and patented in all countries by Dante Alighieri. 
			Talked rapidly of myself and my plans. In the midst of it 
			unluckily I made a sudden gesture of a revolutionary nature. I 
			must have looked like a fellow throwing a handful of peas into 
			the air. People began to look at us.  She shook hands a moment 
			after and, in going away, said she hoped I would do what 
			I said. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Now I call that friendly, don't you? </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">Yes, I liked her today. A little or much? Don't know. I 
			liked her and it seems a new feeling to me. Then, in that case, 
			all the rest, all that I thought I thought and all that I felt I felt, 
			all the rest before now, in fact ... O, give it up, old chap! 
			Sleep it off! </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">16 &gt; Away! Away! </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">The spell of arms and voices: the white arms of roads, their 
			promise of close embraces and the black arms of tall ships that 
			stand against the moon, their tale of distant nations. They are 
			held out to say: We are alone. Come. And the voices say with 
			them: We are your kinsmen.  And  the air is thick with their 
			company as they call to me, their kinsman, making ready to 
			go, shaking the wings of their exultant and terrible youth. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">26 &gt; Mother is putting my new secondhand clothes in 
			order. She prays now, she says, that I may learn in my own 
			life and away from home and friends what the heart is and 
			what it feels. Amen. So be it. Welcome, O life! I go to encounter 
			for the millionth time the reality of experience and to forge 
			in the smithy of my soul the uncreated conscience of my race. </p>
		<p class="textParagraph">27 &gt; Old father, old artificer, stand me now and ever 
			in good stead. </p>
